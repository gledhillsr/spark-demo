behold
i
will
send
for
many
fishers
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
fish
them
and
after
will
i
send
for
many
hunters
and
they
shall
hunt
them
from
every
mountain
and
from
every
hill
and
out
of
the
holes
of
the
rocks
for
mine
eyes
are
upon
all
their
ways
they
are
not
hid
from
my
face
neither
is
their
iniquity
hid
from
mine
eyes
and
first
i
will
recompense
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
double
because
they
have
defiled
my
land
they
have
filled
mine
inheritance
with
the
carcases
of
their
detestable
and
abominable
things
o
lord
my
strength
and
my
fortress
and
my
refuge
in
the
day
of
affliction
the
gentiles
shall
come
unto
thee
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
shall
say
surely
our
fathers
have
inherited
lies
vanity
and
things
wherein
there
is
no
profit
shall
a
man
make
gods
unto
himself
and
they
are
no
gods
therefore
behold
i
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know
i
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand
and
my
might
and
they
shall
know
that
my
name
is
the
lord
the
sin
of
judah
is
written
with
a
pen
of
iron
and
with
the
point
of
a
diamond
it
is
graven
upon
the
table
of
their
heart
and
upon
the
horns
of
your
altars
whilst
their
children
remember
their
altars
and
their
groves
by
the
green
trees
upon
the
high
hills
o
my
mountain
in
the
field
i
will
give
thy
substance
and
all
thy
treasures
to
the
spoil
and
thy
high
places
for
sin
throughout
all
thy
borders
and
thou
even
thyself
shalt
discontinue
from
thine
heritage
that
i
gave
thee
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
serve
thine
enemies
in
the
land
which
thou
knowest
not
for
ye
have
kindled
a
fire
in
mine
anger
which
shall
burn
for
ever
thus
saith
the
lord
cursed
be
the
man
that
trusteth
in
man
and
maketh
flesh
his
arm
and
whose
heart
departeth
from
the
lord
for
he
shall
be
like
the
heath
in
the
desert
and
shall
not
see
when
good
cometh
but
shall
inhabit
the
parched
places
in
the
wilderness
in
a
salt
land
and
not
inhabited
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
the
lord
and
whose
hope
the
lord
is
for
he
shall
be
as
a
tree
planted
by
the
waters
and
that
spreadeth
out
her
roots
by
the
river
and
shall
not
see
when
heat
cometh
but
her
leaf
shall
be
green
and
shall
not
be
careful
in
the
year
of
drought
neither
shall
cease
from
yielding
fruit
the
heart
is
deceitful
above
all
things
and
desperately
wicked
who
can
know
it
i
the
lord
search
the
heart
i
try
the
reins
even
to
give
every
man
according
to
his
ways
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings
as
the
partridge
sitteth
on
eggs
and
hatcheth
them
not
so
he
that
getteth
riches
and
not
by
right
shall
leave
them
in
the
midst
of
his
days
and
at
his
end
shall
be
a
fool
a
glorious
high
throne
from
the
beginning
is
the
place
of
our
sanctuary
o
lord
the
hope
of
israel
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth
because
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
the
fountain
of
living
waters
heal
me
o
lord
and
i
shall
be
healed
save
me
and
i
shall
be
saved
for
thou
art
my
praise
behold
they
say
unto
me
where
is
the
word
of
the
lord
let
it
come
now
as
for
me
i
have
not
hastened
from
being
a
pastor
to
follow
thee
neither
have
i
desired
the
woeful
day
thou
knowest
that
which
came
out
of
my
lips
was
right
before
thee
be
not
a
terror
unto
me
thou
art
my
hope
in
the
day
of
evil
let
them
be
confounded
that
persecute
me
but
let
not
me
be
confounded
let
them
be
dismayed
but
let
not
me
be
dismayed
bring
upon
them
the
day
of
evil
and
destroy
them
with
double
destruction
thus
said
the
lord
unto
me
go
and
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
children
of
the
people
whereby
the
kings
of
judah
come
in
and
by
the
which
they
go
out
and
in
all
the
gates
of
jerusalem
and
say
unto
them
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
kings
of
judah
and
all
judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
that
enter
in
by
these
gates
thus
saith
the
lord
take
heed
to
yourselves
and
bear
no
burden
on
the
sabbath
day
nor
bring
it
in
by
the
gates
of
jerusalem
neither
carry
forth
a
burden
out
of
your
houses
on
the
sabbath
day
neither
do
ye
any
work
but
hallow
ye
the
sabbath
day
as
i
commanded
your
fathers
but
they
obeyed
not
neither
inclined
their
ear
but
made
their
neck
stiff
that
they
might
not
hear
nor
receive
instruction
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
diligently
hearken
unto
me
saith
the
lord
to
bring
in
no
burden
through
the
gates
of
this
city
on
the
sabbath
day
but
hallow
the
sabbath
day
to
do
no
work
therein
then
shall
there
enter
into
the
gates
of
this
city
kings
and
princes
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses
they
and
their
princes
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
this
city
shall
remain
for
ever
and
they
shall
come
from
the
cities
of
judah
and
from
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
from
the
land
of
benjamin
and
from
the
plain
and
from
the
mountains
and
from
the
south
bringing
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
and
meat
offerings
and
incense
and
bringing
sacrifices
of
praise
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
but
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
to
hallow
the
sabbath
day
and
not
to
bear
a
burden
even
entering
in
at
the
gates
of
jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day
then
will
i
kindle
a
fire
in
the
gates
thereof
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
of
jerusalem
and
it
shall
not
be
quenched
the
word
which
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
arise
and
go
down
to
the
potter's
house
and
there
i
will
cause
thee
to
hear
my
words
then
i
went
down
to
the
potter's
house
and
behold
he
wrought
a
work
on
the
wheels
and
the
vessel
that
he
made
of
clay
was
marred
in
the
hand
of
the
potter
so
he
made
it
again
another
vessel
as
seemed
good
to
the
potter
to
make
it
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
o
house
of
israel
cannot
i
do
with
you
as
this
potter
saith
the
lord
behold
as
the
clay
is
in
the
potter's
hand
so
are
ye
in
mine
hand
o
house
of
israel
at
what
instant
i
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation
and
concerning
a
kingdom
to
pluck
up
and
to
pull
down
and
to
destroy
it
if
that
nation
against
whom
i
have
pronounced
turn
from
their
evil
i
will
repent
of
the
evil
that
i
thought
to
do
unto
them
and
at
what
instant
i
shall
speak
concerning
a
nation
and
concerning
a
kingdom
to
build
and
to
plant
it
if
it
do
evil
in
my
sight
that
it
obey
not
my
voice
then
i
will
repent
of
the
good
wherewith
i
said
i
would
benefit
them
now
therefore
go
to
speak
to
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
frame
evil
against
you
and
devise
a
device
against
you
return
ye
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
make
your
ways
and
your
doings
good
and
they
said
there
is
no
hope
but
we
will
walk
after
our
own
devices
and
we
will
every
one
do
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
ask
ye
now
among
the
heathen
who
hath
heard
such
things
the
virgin
of
israel
hath
done
a
very
horrible
thing
will
a
man
leave
the
snow
of
lebanon
which
cometh
from
the
rock
of
the
field
or
shall
the
cold
flowing
waters
that
come
from
another
place
be
forsaken
because
my
people
hath
forgotten
me
they
have
burned
incense
to
vanity
and
they
have
caused
them
to
stumble
in
their
ways
from
the
ancient
paths
to
walk
in
paths
in
a
way
not
cast
up
to
make
their
land
desolate
and
a
perpetual
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished
and
wag
his
head
i
will
scatter
them
as
with
an
east
wind
before
the
enemy
i
will
shew
them
the
back
and
not
the
face
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
then
said
they
come
and
let
us
devise
devices
against
jeremiah
for
the
law
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest
nor
counsel
from
the
wise
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet
come
and
let
us
smite
him
with
the
tongue
and
let
us
not
give
heed
to
any
of
his
words
give
heed
to
me
o
lord
and
hearken
to
the
voice
of
them
that
contend
with
me
shall
evil
be
recompensed
for
good
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
for
my
soul
remember
that
i
stood
before
thee
to
speak
good
for
them
and
to
turn
away
thy
wrath
from
them
therefore
deliver
up
their
children
to
the
famine
and
pour
out
their
blood
by
the
force
of
the
sword
and
let
their
wives
be
bereaved
of
their
children
and
be
widows
and
let
their
men
be
put
to
death
let
their
young
men
be
slain
by
the
sword
in
battle
let
a
cry
be
heard
from
their
houses
when
thou
shalt
bring
a
troop
suddenly
upon
them
for
they
have
digged
a
pit
to
take
me
and
hid
snares
for
my
feet
yet
lord
thou
knowest
all
their
counsel
against
me
to
slay
me
forgive
not
their
iniquity
neither
blot
out
their
sin
from
thy
sight
but
let
them
be
overthrown
before
thee
deal
thus
with
them
in
the
time
of
thine
anger
thus
saith
the
lord
go
and
get
a
potter's
earthen
bottle
and
take
of
the
ancients
of
the
people
and
of
the
ancients
of
the
priests
and
go
forth
unto
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
which
is
by
the
entry
of
the
east
gate
and
proclaim
there
the
words
that
i
shall
tell
thee
and
say
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
o
kings
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
the
which
whosoever
heareth
his
ears
shall
tingle
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
estranged
this
place
and
have
burned
incense
in
it
unto
other
gods
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known
nor
the
kings
of
judah
and
have
filled
this
place
with
the
blood
of
innocents
they
have
built
also
the
high
places
of
baal
to
burn
their
sons
with
fire
for
burnt
offerings
unto
baal
which
i
commanded
not
nor
spake
it
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
this
place
shall
no
more
be
called
tophet
nor
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
but
the
valley
of
slaughter
and
i
will
make
void
the
counsel
of
judah
and
jerusalem
in
this
place
and
i
will
cause
them
to
fall
by
the
sword
before
their
enemies
and
by
the
hands
of
them
that
seek
their
lives
and
their
carcases
will
i
give
to
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
i
will
make
this
city
desolate
and
an
hissing
every
one
that
passeth
thereby
shall
be
astonished
and
hiss
because
of
all
the
plagues
thereof
and
i
will
cause
them
to
eat
the
flesh
of
their
sons
and
the
flesh
of
their
daughters
and
they
shall
eat
every
one
the
flesh
of
his
friend
in
the
siege
and
straitness
wherewith
their
enemies
and
they
that
seek
their
lives
shall
straiten
them
then
shalt
thou
break
the
bottle
in
the
sight
of
the
men
that
go
with
thee
and
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
even
so
will
i
break
this
people
and
this
city
as
one
breaketh
a
potter's
vessel
that
cannot
be
made
whole
again
and
they
shall
bury
them
in
tophet
till
there
be
no
place
to
bury
thus
will
i
do
unto
this
place
saith
the
lord
and
to
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
even
make
this
city
as
tophet
and
the
houses
of
jerusalem
and
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
judah
shall
be
defiled
as
the
place
of
tophet
because
of
all
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
burned
incense
unto
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
have
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
then
came
jeremiah
from
tophet
whither
the
lord
had
sent
him
to
prophesy
and
he
stood
in
the
court
of
the
lord's
house
and
said
to
all
the
people
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
upon
this
city
and
upon
all
her
towns
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
it
because
they
have
hardened
their
necks
that
they
might
not
hear
my
words
now
pashur
the
son
of
immer
the
priest
who
was
also
chief
governor
in
the
house
of
the
lord
heard
that
jeremiah
prophesied
these
things
then
pashur
smote
jeremiah
the
prophet
and
put
him
in
the
stocks
that
were
in
the
high
gate
of
benjamin
which
was
by
the
house
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
pashur
brought
forth
jeremiah
out
of
the
stocks
then
said
jeremiah
unto
him
the
lord
hath
not
called
thy
name
pashur
but
magormissabib
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
make
thee
a
terror
to
thyself
and
to
all
thy
friends
and
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
of
their
enemies
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
it
and
i
will
give
all
judah
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
carry
them
captive
into
babylon
and
shall
slay
them
with
the
sword
moreover
i
will
deliver
all
the
strength
of
this
city
and
all
the
labours
thereof
and
all
the
precious
things
thereof
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
kings
of
judah
will
i
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
which
shall
spoil
them
and
take
them
and
carry
them
to
babylon
and
thou
pashur
and
all
that
dwell
in
thine
house
shall
go
into
captivity
and
thou
shalt
come
to
babylon
and
there
thou
shalt
die
and
shalt
be
buried
there
thou
and
all
thy
friends
to
whom
thou
hast
prophesied
lies
o
lord
thou
hast
deceived
me
and
i
was
deceived
thou
art
stronger
than
i
and
hast
prevailed
i
am
in
derision
daily
every
one
mocketh
me
for
since
i
spake
i
cried
out
i
cried
violence
and
spoil
because
the
word
of
the
lord
was
made
a
reproach
unto
me
and
a
derision
daily
then
i
said
i
will
not
make
mention
of
him
nor
speak
any
more
in
his
name
but
his
word
was
in
mine
heart
as
a
burning
fire
shut
up
in
my
bones
and
i
was
weary
with
forbearing
and
i
could
not
stay
for
i
heard
the
defaming
of
many
fear
on
every
side
report
say
they
and
we
will
report
it
all
my
familiars
watched
for
my
halting
saying
peradventure
he
will
be
enticed
and
we
shall
prevail
against
him
and
we
shall
take
our
revenge
on
him
but
the
lord
is
with
me
as
a
mighty
terrible
one
therefore
my
persecutors
shall
stumble
and
they
shall
not
prevail
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed
for
they
shall
not
prosper
their
everlasting
confusion
shall
never
be
forgotten
but
o
lord
of
hosts
that
triest
the
righteous
and
seest
the
reins
and
the
heart
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them
for
unto
thee
have
i
opened
my
cause
sing
unto
the
lord
praise
ye
the
lord
for
he
hath
delivered
the
soul
of
the
poor
from
the
hand
of
evildoers
cursed
be
the
day
wherein
i
was
born
let
not
the
day
wherein
my
mother
bare
me
be
blessed
cursed
be
the
man
who
brought
tidings
to
my
father
saying
a
man
child
is
born
unto
thee
making
him
very
glad
and
let
that
man
be
as
the
cities
which
the
lord
overthrew
and
repented
not
and
let
him
hear
the
cry
in
the
morning
and
the
shouting
at
noontide
because
he
slew
me
not
from
the
womb
or
that
my
mother
might
have
been
my
grave
and
her
womb
to
be
always
great
with
me
wherefore
came
i
forth
out
of
the
womb
to
see
labour
and
sorrow
that
my
days
should
be
consumed
with
shame
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
when
king
zedekiah
sent
unto
him
pashur
the
son
of
melchiah
and
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
saying
enquire
i
pray
thee
of
the
lord
for
us
for
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
maketh
war
against
us
if
so
be
that
the
lord
will
deal
with
us
according
to
all
his
wondrous
works
that
he
may
go
up
from
us
then
said
jeremiah
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
to
zedekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
turn
back
the
weapons
of
war
that
are
in
your
hands
wherewith
ye
fight
against
the
king
of
babylon
and
against
the
chaldeans
which
besiege
you
without
the
walls
and
i
will
assemble
them
into
the
midst
of
this
city
and
i
myself
will
fight
against
you
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
with
a
strong
arm
even
in
anger
and
in
fury
and
in
great
wrath
and
i
will
smite
the
inhabitants
of
this
city
both
man
and
beast
they
shall
die
of
a
great
pestilence
and
afterward
saith
the
lord
i
will
deliver
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
his
servants
and
the
people
and
such
as
are
left
in
this
city
from
the
pestilence
from
the
sword
and
from
the
famine
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
life
and
he
shall
smite
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
he
shall
not
spare
them
neither
have
pity
nor
have
mercy
and
unto
this
people
thou
shalt
say
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
set
before
you
the
way
of
life
and
the
way
of
death
he
that
abideth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
but
he
that
goeth
out
and
falleth
to
the
chaldeans
that
besiege
you
he
shall
live
and
his
life
shall
be
unto
him
for
a
prey
for
i
have
set
my
face
against
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
saith
the
lord
it
shall
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire
and
touching
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
say
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
o
house
of
david
thus
saith
the
lord
execute
judgment
in
the
morning
and
deliver
him
that
is
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
lest
my
fury
go
out
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
inhabitant
of
the
valley
and
rock
of
the
plain
saith
the
lord
which
say
who
shall
come
down
against
us
or
who
shall
enter
into
our
habitations
but
i
will
punish
you
according
to
the
fruit
of
your
doings
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
forest
thereof
and
it
shall
devour
all
things
round
about
it
thus
saith
the
lord
go
down
to
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
speak
there
this
word
and
say
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
king
of
judah
that
sittest
upon
the
throne
of
david
thou
and
thy
servants
and
thy
people
that
enter
in
by
these
gates
thus
saith
the
lord
execute
ye
judgment
and
righteousness
and
deliver
the
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
and
do
no
wrong
do
no
violence
to
the
stranger
the
fatherless
nor
the
widow
neither
shed
innocent
blood
in
this
place
for
if
ye
do
this
thing
indeed
then
shall
there
enter
in
by
the
gates
of
this
house
kings
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses
he
and
his
servants
and
his
people
but
if
ye
will
not
hear
these
words
i
swear
by
myself
saith
the
lord
that
this
house
shall
become
a
desolation
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
king's
house
of
judah
thou
art
gilead
unto
me
and
the
head
of
lebanon
yet
surely
i
will
make
thee
a
wilderness
and
cities
which
are
not
inhabited
and
i
will
prepare
destroyers
against
thee
every
one
with
his
weapons
and
they
shall
cut
down
thy
choice
cedars
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
and
many
nations
shall
pass
by
this
city
and
they
shall
say
every
man
to
his
neighbour
wherefore
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
great
city
then
they
shall
answer
because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
lord
their
god
and
worshipped
other
gods
and
served
them
weep
ye
not
for
the
dead
neither
bemoan
him
but
weep
sore
for
him
that
goeth
away
for
he
shall
return
no
more
nor
see
his
native
country
for
thus
saith
the
lord
touching
shallum
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
which
reigned
instead
of
josiah
his
father
which
went
forth
out
of
this
place
he
shall
not
return
thither
any
more
but
he
shall
die
in
the
place
whither
they
have
led
him
captive
and
shall
see
this
land
no
more
woe
unto
him
that
buildeth
his
house
by
unrighteousness
and
his
chambers
by
wrong
that
useth
his
neighbour's
service
without
wages
and
giveth
him
not
for
his
work
that
saith
i
will
build
me
a
wide
house
and
large
chambers
and
cutteth
him
out
windows
and
it
is
cieled
with
cedar
and
painted
with
vermilion
shalt
thou
reign
because
thou
closest
thyself
in
cedar
did
not
thy
father
eat
and
drink
and
do
judgment
and
justice
and
then
it
was
well
with
him
he
judged
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy
then
it
was
well
with
him
was
not
this
to
know
me
saith
the
lord
but
thine
eyes
and
thine
heart
are
not
but
for
thy
covetousness
and
for
to
shed
innocent
blood
and
for
oppression
and
for
violence
to
do
it
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
they
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
ah
my
brother
or
ah
sister
they
shall
not
lament
for
him
saying
ah
lord
or
ah
his
glory
he
shall
be
buried
with
the
burial
of
an
ass
drawn
and
cast
forth
beyond
the
gates
of
jerusalem
go
up
to
lebanon
and
cry
and
lift
up
thy
voice
in
bashan
and
cry
from
the
passages
for
all
thy
lovers
are
destroyed
i
spake
unto
thee
in
thy
prosperity
but
thou
saidst
i
will
not
hear
this
hath
been
thy
manner
from
thy
youth
that
thou
obeyedst
not
my
voice
the
wind
shall
eat
up
all
thy
pastors
and
thy
lovers
shall
go
into
captivity
surely
then
shalt
thou
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
all
thy
wickedness
o
inhabitant
of
lebanon
that
makest
thy
nest
in
the
cedars
how
gracious
shalt
thou
be
when
pangs
come
upon
thee
the
pain
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
though
coniah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
were
the
signet
upon
my
right
hand
yet
would
i
pluck
thee
thence
and
i
will
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
thy
life
and
into
the
hand
of
them
whose
face
thou
fearest
even
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
and
i
will
cast
thee
out
and
thy
mother
that
bare
thee
into
another
country
where
ye
were
not
born
and
there
shall
ye
die
but
to
the
land
whereunto
they
desire
to
return
thither
shall
they
not
return
is
this
man
coniah
a
despised
broken
idol
is
he
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
wherefore
are
they
cast
out
he
and
his
seed
and
are
cast
into
a
land
which
they
know
not
o
earth
earth
earth
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
write
ye
this
man
childless
a
man
that
shall
not
prosper
in
his
days
for
no
man
of
his
seed
shall
prosper
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
ruling
any
more
in
judah
woe
be
unto
the
pastors
that
destroy
and
scatter
the
sheep
of
my
pasture
saith
the
lord
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
against
the
pastors
that
feed
my
people
ye
have
scattered
my
flock
and
driven
them
away
and
have
not
visited
them
behold
i
will
visit
upon
you
the
evil
of
your
doings
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
gather
the
remnant
of
my
flock
out
of
all
countries
whither
i
have
driven
them
and
will
bring
them
again
to
their
folds
and
they
shall
be
fruitful
and
increase
and
i
will
set
up
shepherds
over
them
which
shall
feed
them
and
they
shall
fear
no
more
nor
be
dismayed
neither
shall
they
be
lacking
saith
the
lord
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
raise
unto
david
a
righteous
branch
and
a
king
shall
reign
and
prosper
and
shall
execute
judgment
and
justice
in
the
earth
in
his
days
judah
shall
be
saved
and
israel
shall
dwell
safely
and
this
is
his
name
whereby
he
shall
be
called
the
lord
our
righteousness
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
they
shall
no
more
say
the
lord
liveth
which
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
the
lord
liveth
which
brought
up
and
which
led
the
seed
of
the
house
of
israel
out
of
the
north
country
and
from
all
countries
whither
i
had
driven
them
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
own
land
mine
heart
within
me
is
broken
because
of
the
prophets
all
my
bones
shake
i
am
like
a
drunken
man
and
like
a
man
whom
wine
hath
overcome
because
of
the
lord
and
because
of
the
words
of
his
holiness
for
the
land
is
full
of
adulterers
for
because
of
swearing
the
land
mourneth
the
pleasant
places
of
the
wilderness
are
dried
up
and
their
course
is
evil
and
their
force
is
not
right
for
both
prophet
and
priest
are
profane
yea
in
my
house
have
i
found
their
wickedness
saith
the
lord
wherefore
their
way
shall
be
unto
them
as
slippery
ways
in
the
darkness
they
shall
be
driven
on
and
fall
therein
for
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
even
the
year
of
their
visitation
saith
the
lord
and
i
have
seen
folly
in
the
prophets
of
samaria
they
prophesied
in
baal
and
caused
my
people
israel
to
err
i
have
seen
also
in
the
prophets
of
jerusalem
an
horrible
thing
they
commit
adultery
and
walk
in
lies
they
strengthen
also
the
hands
of
evildoers
that
none
doth
return
from
his
wickedness
they
are
all
of
them
unto
me
as
sodom
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
as
gomorrah
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
concerning
the
prophets
behold
i
will
feed
them
with
wormwood
and
make
them
drink
the
water
of
gall
for
from
the
prophets
of
jerusalem
is
profaneness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
they
make
you
vain
they
speak
a
vision
of
their
own
heart
and
not
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lord
they
say
still
unto
them
that
despise
me
the
lord
hath
said
ye
shall
have
peace
and
they
say
unto
every
one
that
walketh
after
the
imagination
of
his
own
heart
no
evil
shall
come
upon
you
for
who
hath
stood
in
the
counsel
of
the
lord
and
hath
perceived
and
heard
his
word
who
hath
marked
his
word
and
heard
it
behold
a
whirlwind
of
the
lord
is
gone
forth
in
fury
even
a
grievous
whirlwind
it
shall
fall
grievously
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked
the
anger
of
the
lord
shall
not
return
until
he
have
executed
and
till
he
have
performed
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it
perfectly
i
have
not
sent
these
prophets
yet
they
ran
i
have
not
spoken
to
them
yet
they
prophesied
but
if
they
had
stood
in
my
counsel
and
had
caused
my
people
to
hear
my
words
then
they
should
have
turned
them
from
their
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
of
their
doings
am
i
a
god
at
hand
saith
the
lord
and
not
a
god
afar
off
can
any
hide
himself
in
secret
places
that
i
shall
not
see
him
saith
the
lord
do
not
i
fill
heaven
and
earth
saith
the
lord
i
have
heard
what
the
prophets
said
that
prophesy
lies
in
my
name
saying
i
have
dreamed
i
have
dreamed
how
long
shall
this
be
in
the
heart
of
the
prophets
that
prophesy
lies
yea
they
are
prophets
of
the
deceit
of
their
own
heart
which
think
to
cause
my
people
to
forget
my
name
by
their
dreams
which
they
tell
every
man
to
his
neighbour
as
their
fathers
have
forgotten
my
name
for
baal
the
prophet
that
hath
a
dream
let
him
tell
a
dream
and
he
that
hath
my
word
let
him
speak
my
word
faithfully
what
is
the
chaff
to
the
wheat
saith
the
lord
is
not
my
word
like
as
a
fire
saith
the
lord
and
like
a
hammer
that
breaketh
the
rock
in
pieces
therefore
behold
i
am
against
the
prophets
saith
the
lord
that
steal
my
words
every
one
from
his
neighbour
behold
i
am
against
the
prophets
saith
the
lord
that
use
their
tongues
and
say
he
saith
behold
i
am
against
them
that
prophesy
false
dreams
saith
the
lord
and
do
tell
them
and
cause
my
people
to
err
by
their
lies
and
by
their
lightness
yet
i
sent
them
not
nor
commanded
them
therefore
they
shall
not
profit
this
people
at
all
saith
the
lord
and
when
this
people
or
the
prophet
or
a
priest
shall
ask
thee
saying
what
is
the
burden
of
the
lord
thou
shalt
then
say
unto
them
what
burden
i
will
even
forsake
you
saith
the
lord
and
as
for
the
prophet
and
the
priest
and
the
people
that
shall
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
i
will
even
punish
that
man
and
his
house
thus
shall
ye
say
every
one
to
his
neighbour
and
every
one
to
his
brother
what
hath
the
lord
answered
and
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
and
the
burden
of
the
lord
shall
ye
mention
no
more
for
every
man's
word
shall
be
his
burden
for
ye
have
perverted
the
words
of
the
living
god
of
the
lord
of
hosts
our
god
thus
shalt
thou
say
to
the
prophet
what
hath
the
lord
answered
thee
and
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
but
since
ye
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
because
ye
say
this
word
the
burden
of
the
lord
and
i
have
sent
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
say
the
burden
of
the
lord
therefore
behold
i
even
i
will
utterly
forget
you
and
i
will
forsake
you
and
the
city
that
i
gave
you
and
your
fathers
and
cast
you
out
of
my
presence
and
i
will
bring
an
everlasting
reproach
upon
you
and
a
perpetual
shame
which
shall
not
be
forgotten
the
lord
shewed
me
and
behold
two
baskets
of
figs
were
set
before
the
temple
of
the
lord
after
that
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
captive
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
and
the
princes
of
judah
with
the
carpenters
and
smiths
from
jerusalem
and
had
brought
them
to
babylon
one
basket
had
very
good
figs
even
like
the
figs
that
are
first
ripe
and
the
other
basket
had
very
naughty
figs
which
could
not
be
eaten
they
were
so
bad
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
what
seest
thou
jeremiah
and
i
said
figs
the
good
figs
very
good
and
the
evil
very
evil
that
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
like
these
good
figs
so
will
i
acknowledge
them
that
are
carried
away
captive
of
judah
whom
i
have
sent
out
of
this
place
into
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
for
their
good
for
i
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
good
and
i
will
bring
them
again
to
this
land
and
i
will
build
them
and
not
pull
them
down
and
i
will
plant
them
and
not
pluck
them
up
and
i
will
give
them
an
heart
to
know
me
that
i
am
the
lord
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
for
they
shall
return
unto
me
with
their
whole
heart
and
as
the
evil
figs
which
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
surely
thus
saith
the
lord
so
will
i
give
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
and
his
princes
and
the
residue
of
jerusalem
that
remain
in
this
land
and
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
i
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
for
their
hurt
to
be
a
reproach
and
a
proverb
a
taunt
and
a
curse
in
all
places
whither
i
shall
drive
them
and
i
will
send
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
among
them
till
they
be
consumed
from
off
the
land
that
i
gave
unto
them
and
to
their
fathers
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
all
the
people
of
judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
that
was
the
first
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
the
which
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
all
the
people
of
judah
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
saying
from
the
thirteenth
year
of
josiah
the
son
of
amon
king
of
judah
even
unto
this
day
that
is
the
three
and
twentieth
year
the
word
of
the
lord
hath
come
unto
me
and
i
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
and
the
lord
hath
sent
unto
you
all
his
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
nor
inclined
your
ear
to
hear
they
said
turn
ye
again
now
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
evil
of
your
doings
and
dwell
in
the
land
that
the
lord
hath
given
unto
you
and
to
your
fathers
for
ever
and
ever
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
worship
them
and
provoke
me
not
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands
and
i
will
do
you
no
hurt
yet
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me
saith
the
lord
that
ye
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
the
works
of
your
hands
to
your
own
hurt
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
because
ye
have
not
heard
my
words
behold
i
will
send
and
take
all
the
families
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
and
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
bring
them
against
this
land
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
against
all
these
nations
round
about
and
will
utterly
destroy
them
and
make
them
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
and
perpetual
desolations
moreover
i
will
take
from
them
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
sound
of
the
millstones
and
the
light
of
the
candle
and
this
whole
land
shall
be
a
desolation
and
an
astonishment
and
these
nations
shall
serve
the
king
of
babylon
seventy
years
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
seventy
years
are
accomplished
that
i
will
punish
the
king
of
babylon
and
that
nation
saith
the
lord
for
their
iniquity
and
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
and
will
make
it
perpetual
desolations
and
i
will
bring
upon
that
land
all
my
words
which
i
have
pronounced
against
it
even
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
which
jeremiah
hath
prophesied
against
all
the
nations
for
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
them
also
and
i
will
recompense
them
according
to
their
deeds
and
according
to
the
works
of
their
own
hands
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
unto
me
take
the
wine
cup
of
this
fury
at
my
hand
and
cause
all
the
nations
to
whom
i
send
thee
to
drink
it
and
they
shall
drink
and
be
moved
and
be
mad
because
of
the
sword
that
i
will
send
among
them
then
took
i
the
cup
at
the
lord's
hand
and
made
all
the
nations
to
drink
unto
whom
the
lord
had
sent
me
to
wit
jerusalem
and
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
kings
thereof
and
the
princes
thereof
to
make
them
a
desolation
an

world
which
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
king
of
sheshach
shall
drink
after
them
therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
drink
ye
and
be
drunken
and
spue
and
fall
and
rise
no
more
because
of
the
sword
which
i
will
send
among
you
and
it
shall
be
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
cup
at
thine
hand
to
drink
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
ye
shall
certainly
drink
for
lo
i
begin
to
bring
evil
on
the
city
which
is
called
by
my
name
and
should
ye
be
utterly
unpunished
ye
shall
not
be
unpunished
for
i
will
call
for
a
sword
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
therefore
prophesy
thou
against
them
all
these
words
and
say
unto
them
the
lord
shall
roar
from
on
high
and
utter
his
voice
from
his
holy
habitation
he
shall
mightily
roar
upon
his
habitation
he
shall
give
a
shout
as
they
that
tread
the
grapes
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
a
noise
shall
come
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
the
nations
he
will
plead
with
all
flesh
he
will
give
them
that
are
wicked
to
the
sword
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
evil
shall
go
forth
from
nation
to
nation
and
a
great
whirlwind
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
and
the
slain
of
the
lord
shall
be
at
that
day
from
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth
they
shall
not
be
lamented
neither
gathered
nor
buried
they
shall
be
dung
upon
the
ground
howl
ye
shepherds
and
cry
and
wallow
yourselves
in
the
ashes
ye
principal
of
the
flock
for
the
days
of
your
slaughter
and
of
your
dispersions
are
accomplished
and
ye
shall
fall
like
a
pleasant
vessel
and
the
shepherds
shall
have
no
way
to
flee
nor
the
principal
of
the
flock
to
escape
a
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
shepherds
and
an
howling
of
the
principal
of
the
flock
shall
be
heard
for
the
lord
hath
spoiled
their
pasture
and
the
peaceable
habitations
are
cut
down
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
he
hath
forsaken
his
covert
as
the
lion
for
their
land
is
desolate
because
of
the
fierceness
of
the
oppressor
and
because
of
his
fierce
anger
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
came
this
word
from
the
lord
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
stand
in
the
court
of
the
lord's
house
and
speak
unto
all
the
cities
of
judah
which
come
to
worship
in
the
lord's
house
all
the
words
that
i
command
thee
to
speak
unto
them
diminish
not
a
word
if
so
be
they
will
hearken
and
turn
every
man
from
his
evil
way
that
i
may
repent
me
of
the
evil
which
i
purpose
to
do
unto
them
because
of
the
evil
of
their
doings
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
if
ye
will
not
hearken
to
me
to
walk
in
my
law
which
i
have
set
before
you
to
hearken
to
the
words
of
my
servants
the
prophets
whom
i
sent
unto
you
both
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
have
not
hearkened
then
will
i
make
this
house
like
shiloh
and
will
make
this
city
a
curse
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
so
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
the
lord
now
it
came
to
pass
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
that
the
lord
had
commanded
him
to
speak
unto
all
the
people
that
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
took
him
saying
thou
shalt
surely
die
why
hast
thou
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
lord
saying
this
house
shall
be
like
shiloh
and
this
city
shall
be
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
and
all
the
people
were
gathered
against
jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
lord
when
the
princes
of
judah
heard
these
things
then
they
came
up
from
the
king's
house
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
sat
down
in
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
lord's
house
then
spake
the
priests
and
the
prophets
unto
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
saying
this
man
is
worthy
to
die
for
he
hath
prophesied
against
this
city
as
ye
have
heard
with
your
ears
then
spake
jeremiah
unto
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
saying
the
lord
sent
me
to
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
ye
have
heard
therefore
now
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
and
the
lord
will
repent
him
of
the
evil
that
he
hath
pronounced
against
you
as
for
me
behold
i
am
in
your
hand
do
with
me
as
seemeth
good
and
meet
unto
you
but
know
ye
for
certain
that
if
ye
put
me
to
death
ye
shall
surely
bring
innocent
blood
upon
yourselves
and
upon
this
city
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
for
of
a
truth
the
lord
hath
sent
me
unto
you
to
speak
all
these
words
in
your
ears
then
said
the
princes
and
all
the
people
unto
the
priests
and
to
the
prophets
this
man
is
not
worthy
to
die
for
he
hath
spoken
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
our
god
then
rose
up
certain
of
the
elders
of
the
land
and
spake
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
people
saying
micah
the
morasthite
prophesied
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
spake
to
all
the
people
of
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
zion
shall
be
plowed
like
a
field
and
jerusalem
shall
become
heaps
and
the
mountain
of
the
house
as
the
high
places
of
a
forest
did
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
all
judah
put
him
at
all
to
death
did
he
not
fear
the
lord
and
besought
the
lord
and
the
lord
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
pronounced
against
them
thus
might
we
procure
great
evil
against
our
souls
and
there
was
also
a
man
that
prophesied
in
the
name
of
the
lord
urijah
the
son
of
shemaiah
of
kirjathjearim
who
prophesied
against
this
city
and
against
this
land
according
to
all
the
words
of
jeremiah
and
when
jehoiakim
the
king
with
all
his
mighty
men
and
all
the
princes
heard
his
words
the
king
sought
to
put
him
to
death
but
when
urijah
heard
it
he
was
afraid
and
fled
and
went
into
egypt
and
jehoiakim
the
king
sent
men
into
egypt
namely
elnathan
the
son
of
achbor
and
certain
men
with
him
into
egypt
and
they
fetched
forth
urijah
out
of
egypt
and
brought
him
unto
jehoiakim
the
king
who
slew
him
with
the
sword
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graves
of
the
common
people
nevertheless
the
hand
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
was
with
jeremiah
that
they
should
not
give
him
into
the
hand
of
the
people
to
put
him
to
death
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
came
this
word
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
to
me
make
thee
bonds
and
yokes
and
put
them
upon
thy
neck
and
send
them
to
the
king
of
edom
and
to
the
king
of
moab
and
to
the
king
of
the
ammonites
and
to
the
king
of
tyrus
and
to
the
king
of
zidon
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
which
come
to
jerusalem
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
command
them
to
say
unto
their
masters
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
masters
i
have
made
the
earth
the
man
and
the
beast
that
are
upon
the
ground
by
my
great
power
and
by
my
outstretched
arm
and
have
given
it
unto
whom
it
seemed
meet
unto
me
and
now
have
i
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
have
i
given
him
also
to
serve
him
and
all
nations
shall
serve
him
and
his
son
and
his
son's
son
until
the
very
time
of
his
land
come
and
then
many
nations
and
great
kings
shall
serve
themselves
of
him
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
nation
and
kingdom
which
will
not
serve
the
same
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
and
that
will
not
put
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
that
nation
will
i
punish
saith
the
lord
with
the
sword
and
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
until
i
have
consumed
them
by
his
hand
therefore
hearken
not
ye
to
your
prophets
nor
to
your
diviners
nor
to
your
dreamers
nor
to
your
enchanters
nor
to
your
sorcerers
which
speak
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
to
remove
you
far
from
your
land
and
that
i
should
drive
you
out
and
ye
should
perish
but
the
nations
that
bring
their
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
serve
him
those
will
i
let
remain
still
in
their
own
land
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
till
it
and
dwell
therein
i
spake
also
to
zedekiah
king
of
judah
according
to
all
these
words
saying
bring
your
necks
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
serve
him
and
his
people
and
live
why
will
ye
die
thou
and
thy
people
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
against
the
nation
that
will
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
therefore
hearken
not
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
that
speak
unto
you
saying
ye
shall
not
serve
the
king
of
babylon
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
for
i
have
not
sent
them
saith
the
lord
yet
they
prophesy
a
lie
in
my
name
that
i
might
drive
you
out
and
that
ye
might
perish
ye
and
the
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
also
i
spake
to
the
priests
and
to
all
this
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hearken
not
to
the
words
of
your
prophets
that
prophesy
unto
you
saying
behold
the
vessels
of
the
lord's
house
shall
now
shortly
be
brought
again
from
babylon
for
they
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
hearken
not
unto
them
serve
the
king
of
babylon
and
live
wherefore
should
this
city
be
laid
waste
but
if
they
be
prophets
and
if
the
word
of
the
lord
be
with
them
let
them
now
make
intercession
to
the
lord
of
hosts
that
the
vessels
which
are
left
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
at
jerusalem
go
not
to
babylon
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
concerning
the
pillars
and
concerning
the
sea
and
concerning
the
bases
and
concerning
the
residue
of
the
vessels
that
remain
in
this
city
which
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
took
not
when
he
carried
away
captive
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
and
all
the
nobles
of
judah
and
jerusalem
yea
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
concerning
the
vessels
that
remain
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
judah
and
of
jerusalem
they
shall
be
carried
to
babylon
and
there
shall
they
be
until
the
day
that
i
visit
them
saith
the
lord
then
will
i
bring
them
up
and
restore
them
to
this
place
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
year
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
the
fourth
year
and
in
the
fifth
month
that
hananiah
the
son
of
azur
the
prophet
which
was
of
gibeon
spake
unto
me
in
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
of
all
the
people
saying
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
i
have
broken
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
within
two
full
years
will
i
bring
again
into
this
place
all
the
vessels
of
the
lord's
house
that
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
took
away
from
this
place
and
carried
them
to
babylon
and
i
will
bring
again
to
this
place
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
with
all
the
captives
of
judah
that
went
into
babylon
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
babylon
then
the
prophet
jeremiah
said
unto
the
prophet
hananiah
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
that
stood
in
the
house
of
the
lord
even
the
prophet
jeremiah
said
amen
the
lord
do
so
the
lord
perform
thy
words
which
thou
hast
prophesied
to
bring
again
the
vessels
of
the
lord's
house
and
all
that
is
carried
away
captive
from
babylon
into
this
place
nevertheless
hear
thou
now
this
word
that
i
speak
in
thine
ears
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people
the
prophets
that
have
been
before
me
and
before
thee
of
old
prophesied
both
against
many
countries
and
against
great
kingdoms
of
war
and
of
evil
and
of
pestilence
the
prophet
which
prophesieth
of
peace
when
the
word
of
the
prophet
shall
come
to
pass
then
shall
the
prophet
be
known
that
the
lord
hath
truly
sent
him
then
hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
yoke
from
off
the
prophet
jeremiah's
neck
and
brake
it
and
hananiah
spake
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
even
so
will
i
break
the
yoke
of
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
from
the
neck
of
all
nations
within
the
space
of
two
full
years
and
the
prophet
jeremiah
went
his
way
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
after
that
hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
yoke
from
off
the
neck
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
go
and
tell
hananiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
hast
broken
the
yokes
of
wood
but
thou
shalt
make
for
them
yokes
of
iron
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
i
have
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
the
neck
of
all
these
nations
that
they
may
serve
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
they
shall
serve
him
and
i
have
given
him
the
beasts
of
the
field
also
then
said
the
prophet
jeremiah
unto
hananiah
the
prophet
hear
now
hananiah
the
lord
hath
not
sent
thee
but
thou
makest
this
people
to
trust
in
a
lie
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
cast
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
this
year
thou
shalt
die
because
thou
hast
taught
rebellion
against
the
lord
so
hananiah
the
prophet
died
the
same
year
in
the
seventh
month
now
these
are
the
words
of
the
letter
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
jerusalem
unto
the
residue
of
the
elders
which
were
carried
away
captives
and
to
the
priests
and
to
the
prophets
and
to
all
the
people
whom
nebuchadnezzar
had
carried
away
captive
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
after
that
jeconiah
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
eunuchs
the
princes
of
judah
and
jerusalem
and
the
carpenters
and
the
smiths
were
departed
from
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
elasah
the
son
of
shaphan
and
gemariah
the
son
of
hilkiah
whom
zedekiah
king
of
judah
sent
unto
babylon
to
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
unto
all
that
are
carried
away
captives
whom
i
have
caused
to
be
carried
away
from
jerusalem
unto
babylon
build
ye
houses
and
dwell
in
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
take
ye
wives
and
beget
sons
and
daughters
and
take
wives
for
your
sons
and
give
your
daughters
to
husbands
that
they
may
bear
sons
and
daughters
that
ye
may
be
increased
there
and
not
diminished
and
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
whither
i
have
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captives
and
pray
unto
the
lord
for
it
for
in
the
peace
thereof
shall
ye
have
peace
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
let
not
your
prophets
and
your
diviners
that
be
in
the
midst
of
you
deceive
you
neither
hearken
to
your
dreams
which
ye
cause
to
be
dreamed
for
they
prophesy
falsely
unto
you
in
my
name
i
have
not
sent
them
saith
the
lord
for
thus
saith
the
lord
that
after
seventy
years
be
accomplished
at
babylon
i
will
visit
you
and
perform
my
good
word
toward
you
in
causing
you
to
return
to
this
place
for
i
know
the
thoughts
that
i
think
toward
you
saith
the
lord
thoughts
of
peace
and
not
of
evil
to
give
you
an
expected
end
then
shall
ye
call
upon
me
and
ye
shall
go
and
pray
unto
me
and
i
will
hearken
unto
you
and
ye
shall
seek
me
and
find
me
when
ye
shall
search
for
me
with
all
your
heart
and
i
will
be
found
of
you
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
turn
away
your
captivity
and
i
will
gather
you
from
all
the
nations
and
from
all
the
places
whither
i
have
driven
you
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
bring
you
again
into
the
place
whence
i
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captive
because
ye
have
said
the
lord
hath
raised
us
up
prophets
in
babylon
know
that
thus
saith
the
lord
of
the
king
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
of
all
the
people
that
dwelleth
in
this
city
and
of
your
brethren
that
are
not
gone
forth
with
you
into
captivity
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
send
upon
them
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
will
make
them
like
vile
figs
that
cannot
be
eaten
they
are
so
evil
and
i
will
persecute
them
with
the
sword
with
the
famine
and
with
the
pestilence
and
will
deliver
them
to
be
removed
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
to
be
a
curse
and
an
astonishment
and
an
hissing
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
whither
i
have
driven
them
because
they
have
not
hearkened
to
my
words
saith
the
lord
which
i
sent
unto
them
by
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
would
not
hear
saith
the
lord
hear
ye
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
all
ye
of
the
captivity
whom
i
have
sent
from
jerusalem
to
babylon
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
of
ahab
the
son
of
kolaiah
and
of
zedekiah
the
son
of
maaseiah
which
prophesy
a
lie
unto
you
in
my
name
behold
i
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
slay
them
before
your
eyes
and
of
them
shall
be
taken
up
a
curse
by
all
the
captivity
of
judah
which
are
in
babylon
saying
the
lord
make
thee
like
zedekiah
and
like
ahab
whom
the
king
of
babylon
roasted
in
the
fire
because
they
have
committed
villany
in
israel
and
have
committed
adultery
with
their
neighbours
wives
and
have
spoken
lying
words
in
my
name
which
i
have
not
commanded
them
even
i
know
and
am
a
witness
saith
the
lord
thus
shalt
thou
also
speak
to
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
saying
thus
speaketh
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
because
thou
hast
sent
letters
in
thy
name
unto
all
the
people
that
are
at
jerusalem
and
to
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
and
to
all
the
priests
saying
the
lord
hath
made
thee
priest
in
the
stead
of
jehoiada
the
priest
that
ye
should
be
officers
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
every
man
that
is
mad
and
maketh
himself
a
prophet
that
thou
shouldest
put
him
in
prison
and
in
the
stocks
now
therefore
why
hast
thou
not
reproved
jeremiah
of
anathoth
which
maketh
himself
a
prophet
to
you
for
therefore
he
sent
unto
us
in
babylon
saying
this
captivity
is
long
build
ye
houses
and
dwell
in
them
and
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
and
zephaniah
the
priest
read
this
letter
in
the
ears
of
jeremiah
the
prophet
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
send
to
all
them
of
the
captivity
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
because
that
shemaiah
hath
prophesied
unto
you
and
i
sent
him
not
and
he
caused
you
to
trust
in
a
lie
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
punish
shemaiah
the
nehelamite
and
his
seed
he
shall
not
have
a
man
to
dwell
among
this
people
neither
shall
he
behold
the
good
that
i
will
do
for
my
people
saith
the
lord
because
he
hath
taught
rebellion
against
the
lord
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
thus
speaketh
the
lord
god
of
israel
saying
write
thee
all
the
words
that
i
have
spoken
unto
thee
in
a
book
for
lo
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
my
people
israel
and
judah
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
them
to
return
to
the
land
that
i
gave
to
their
fathers
and
they
shall
possess
it
and
these
are
the
words
that
the
lord
spake
concerning
israel
and
concerning
judah
for
thus
saith
the
lord
we
have
heard
a
voice
of
trembling
of
fear
and
not
of
peace
ask
ye
now
and
see
whether
a
man
doth
travail
with
child
wherefore
do
i
see
every
man
with
his
hands
on
his
loins
as
a
woman
in
travail
and
all
faces
are
turned
into
paleness
alas
for
that
day
is
great
so
that
none
is
like
it
it
is
even
the
time
of
jacob's
trouble
but
he
shall
be
saved
out
of
it
for
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
i
will
break
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
and
will
burst
thy
bonds
and
strangers
shall
no
more
serve
themselves
of
him
but
they
shall
serve
the
lord
their
god
and
david
their
king
whom
i
will
raise
up
unto
them
therefore
fear
thou
not
o
my
servant
jacob
saith
the
lord
neither
be
dismayed
o
israel
for
lo
i
will
save
thee
from
afar
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
and
jacob
shall
return
and
shall
be
in
rest
and
be
quiet
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid
for
i
am
with
thee
saith
the
lord
to
save
thee
though
i
make
a
full
end
of
all
nations
whither
i
have
scattered
thee
yet
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee
but
i
will
correct
thee
in
measure
and
will
not
leave
thee
altogether
unpunished
for
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
bruise
is
incurable
and
thy
wound
is
grievous
there
is
none
to
plead
thy
cause
that
thou
mayest
be
bound
up
thou
hast
no
healing
medicines
all
thy
lovers
have
forgotten
thee
they
seek
thee
not
for
i
have
wounded
thee
with
the
wound
of
an
enemy
with
the
chastisement
of
a
cruel
one
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
why
criest
thou
for
thine
affliction
thy
sorrow
is
incurable
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
because
thy
sins
were
increased
i
have
done
these
things
unto
thee
therefore
all
they
that
devour
thee
shall
be
devoured
and
all
thine
adversaries
every
one
of
them
shall
go
into
captivity
and
they
that
spoil
thee
shall
be
a
spoil
and
all
that
prey
upon
thee
will
i
give
for
a
prey
for
i
will
restore
health
unto
thee
and
i
will
heal
thee
of
thy
wounds
saith
the
lord
because
they
called
thee
an
outcast
saying
this
is
zion
whom
no
man
seeketh
after
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
jacob's
tents
and
have
mercy
on
his
dwellingplaces
and
the
city
shall
be
builded
upon
her
own
heap
and
the
palace
shall
remain
after
the
manner
thereof
and
out
of
them
shall
proceed
thanksgiving
and
the
voice
of
them
that
make
merry
and
i
will
multiply
them
and
they
shall
not
be
few
i
will
also
glorify
them
and
they
shall
not
be
small
their
children
also
shall
be
as
aforetime
and
their
congregation
shall
be
established
before
me
and
i
will
punish
all
that
oppress
them
and
their
nobles
shall
be
of
themselves
and
their
governor
shall
proceed
from
the
midst
of
them
and
i
will
cause
him
to
draw
near
and
he
shall
approach
unto
me
for
who
is
this
that
engaged
his
heart
to
approach
unto
me
saith
the
lord
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
behold
the
whirlwind
of
the
lord
goeth
forth
with
fury
a
continuing
whirlwind
it
shall
fall
with
pain
upon
the
head
of
the
wicked
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
shall
not
return
until
he
hath
done
it
and
until
he
have
performed
the
intents
of
his
heart
in
the
latter
days
ye
shall
consider
it
at
the
same
time
saith
the
lord
will
i
be
the
god
of
all
the
families
of
israel
and
they
shall
be
my
people
thus
saith
the
lord
the
people
which
were
left
of
the
sword
found
grace
in
the
wilderness
even
israel
when
i
went
to
cause
him
to
rest
the
lord
hath
appeared
of
old
unto
me
saying
yea
i
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love
therefore
with
lovingkindness
have
i
drawn
thee
again
i
will
build
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
built
o
virgin
of
israel
thou
shalt
again
be
adorned
with
thy
tabrets
and
shalt
go
forth
in
the
dances
of
them
that
make
merry
thou
shalt
yet
plant
vines
upon
the
mountains
of
samaria
the
planters
shall
plant
and
shall
eat
them
as
common
things
for
there
shall
be
a
day
that
the
watchmen
upon
the
mount
ephraim
shall
cry
arise
ye
and
let
us
go
up
to
zion
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
thus
saith
the
lord
sing
with
gladness
for
jacob
and
shout
among
the
chief
of
the
nations
publish
ye
praise
ye
and
say
o
lord
save
thy
people
the
remnant
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
them
from
the
north
country
and
gather
them
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
and
with
them
the
blind
and
the
lame
the
woman
with
child
and
her
that
travaileth
with
child
together
a
great
company
shall
return
thither
they
shall
come
with
weeping
and
with
supplications
will
i
lead
them
i
will
cause
them
to
walk
by
the
rivers
of
waters
in
a
straight
way
wherein
they
shall
not
stumble
for
i
am
a
father
to
israel
and
ephraim
is
my
firstborn
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
ye
nations
and
declare
it
in
the
isles
afar
off
and
say
he
that
scattered
israel
will
gather
him
and
keep
him
as
a
shepherd
doth
his
flock
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
ransomed
him
from
the
hand
of
him
that
was
stronger
than
he
therefore
they
shall
come
and
sing
in
the
height
of
zion
and
shall
flow
together
to
the
goodness
of
the
lord
for
wheat
and
for
wine
and
for
oil
and
for
the
young
of
the
flock
and
of
the
herd
and
their
soul
shall
be
as
a
watered
garden
and
they
shall
not
sorrow
any
more
at
all
then
shall
the
virgin
rejoice
in
the
dance
both
young
men
and
old
together
for
i
will
turn
their
mourning
into
joy
and
will
comfort
them
and
make
them
rejoice
from
their
sorrow
and
i
will
satiate
the
soul
of
the
priests
with
fatness
and
my
people
shall
be
satisfied
with
my
goodness
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
a
voice
was
heard
in
ramah
lamentation
and
bitter
weeping
rahel
weeping
for
her
children
refused
to
be
comforted
for
her
children
because
they
were
not
thus
saith
the
lord
refrain
thy
voice
from
weeping
and
thine
eyes
from
tears
for
thy
work
shall
be
rewarded
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
come
again
from
the
land
of
the
enemy
and
there
is
hope
in
thine
end
saith
the
lord
that
thy
children
shall
come
again
to
their
own
border
i
have
surely
heard
ephraim
bemoaning
himself
thus
thou
hast
chastised
me
and
i
was
chastised
as
a
bullock
unaccustomed
to
the
yoke
turn
thou
me
and
i
shall
be
turned
for
thou
art
the
lord
my
god
surely
after
that
i
was
turned
i
repented
and
after
that
i
was
instructed
i
smote
upon
my
thigh
i
was
ashamed
yea
even
confounded
because
i
did
bear
the
reproach
of
my
youth
is
ephraim
my
dear
son
is
he
a
pleasant
child
for
since
i
spake
against
him
i
do
earnestly
remember
him
still
therefore
my
bowels
are
troubled
for
him
i
will
surely
have
mercy
upon
him
saith
the
lord
set
thee
up
waymarks
make
thee
high
heaps
set
thine
heart
toward
the
highway
even
the
way
which
thou
wentest
turn
again
o
virgin
of
israel
turn
again
to
these
thy
cities
how
long
wilt
thou
go
about
o
thou
backsliding
daughter
for
the
lord
hath
created
a
new
thing
in
the
earth
a
woman
shall
compass
a
man
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
as
yet
they
shall
use
this
speech
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
thereof
when
i
shall
bring
again
their
captivity
the
lord
bless
thee
o
habitation
of
justice
and
mountain
of
holiness
and
there
shall
dwell
in
judah
itself
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof
together
husbandmen
and
they
that
go
forth
with
flocks
for
i
have
satiated
the
weary
soul
and
i
have
replenished
every
sorrowful
soul
upon
this
i
awaked
and
beheld
and
my
sleep
was
sweet
unto
me
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
sow
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
with
the
seed
of
man
and
with
the
seed
of
beast
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
like
as
i
have
watched
over
them
to
pluck
up
and
to
break
down
and
to
throw
down
and
to
destroy
and
to
afflict
so
will
i
watch
over
them
to
build
and
to
plant
saith
the
lord
in
those
days
they
shall
say
no
more
the
fathers
have
eaten
a
sour
grape
and
the
children's
teeth
are
set
on
edge
but
every
one
shall
die
for
his
own
iniquity
every
man
that
eateth
the
sour
grape
his
teeth
shall
be
set
on
edge
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
which
my
covenant
they
brake
although
i
was
an
husband
unto
them
saith
the
lord
but
this
shall
be
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
law
in
their
inward
parts
and
write
it
in
their
hearts
and
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
they
shall
teach
no
more
every
man
his
neighbour
and
every
man
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
for
they
shall
all
know
me
from
the
least
of
them
unto
the
greatest
of
them
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
forgive
their
iniquity
and
i
will
remember
their
sin
no
more
thus
saith
the
lord
which
giveth
the
sun
for
a
light
by
day
and
the
ordinances
of
the
moon
and
of
the
stars
for
a
light
by
night
which
divideth
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
roar
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
if
those
ordinances
depart
from
before
me
saith
the
lord
then
the
seed
of
israel
also
shall
cease
from
being
a
nation
before
me
for
ever
thus
saith
the
lord
if
heaven
above
can
be
measured
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
searched
out
beneath
i
will
also
cast
off
all
the
seed
of
israel
for
all
that
they
have
done
saith
the
lord
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
the
city
shall
be
built
to
the
lord
from
the
tower
of
hananeel
unto
the
gate
of
the
corner
and
the
measuring
line
shall
yet
go
forth
over
against
it
upon
the
hill
gareb
and
shall
compass
about
to
goath
and
the
whole
valley
of
the
dead
bodies
and
of
the
ashes
and
all
the
fields
unto
the
brook
of
kidron
unto
the
corner
of
the
horse
gate
toward
the
east
shall
be
holy
unto
the
lord
it
shall
not
be
plucked
up
nor
thrown
down
any
more
for
ever
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
in
the
tenth
year
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
which
was
the
eighteenth
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
for
then
the
king
of
babylon's
army
besieged
jerusalem
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
was
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
which
was
in
the
king
of
judah's
house
for
zedekiah
king
of
judah
had
shut
him
up
saying
wherefore
dost
thou
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take
it
and
zedekiah
king
of
judah
shall
not
escape
out
of
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
but
shall
surely
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
shall
speak
with
him
mouth
to
mouth
and
his
eyes
shall
behold
his
eyes
and
he
shall
lead
zedekiah
to
babylon
and
there
shall
he
be
until
i
visit
him
saith
the
lord
though
ye
fight
with
the
chaldeans
ye
shall
not
prosper
and
jeremiah
said
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
behold
hanameel
the
son
of
shallum
thine
uncle
shall
come
unto
thee
saying
buy
thee
my
field
that
is
in
anathoth
for
the
right
of
redemption
is
thine
to
buy
it
so
hanameel
mine
uncle's
son
came
to
me
in
the
court
of
the
prison
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
said
unto
me
buy
my
field
i
pray
thee
that
is
in
anathoth
which
is
in
the
country
of
benjamin
for
the
right
of
inheritance
is
thine
and
the
redemption
is
thine
buy
it
for
thyself
then
i
knew
that
this
was
the
word
of
the
lord
and
i
bought
the
field
of
hanameel
my
uncle's
son
that
was
in
anathoth
and
weighed
him
the
money
even
seventeen
shekels
of
silver
and
i
subscribed
the
evidence
and
sealed
it
and
took
witnesses
and
weighed
him
the
money
in
the
balances
so
i
took
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
both
that
which
was
sealed
according
to
the
law
and
custom
and
that
which
was
open
and
i
gave
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
the
son
of
maaseiah
in
the
sight
of
hanameel
mine
uncle's
son
and
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
that
subscribed
the
book
of
the
purchase
before
all
the
jews
that
sat
in
the
court
of
the
prison
and
i
charged
baruch
before
them
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
take
these
evidences
this
evidence
of
the
purchase
both
which
is
sealed
and
this
evidence
which
is
open
and
put
them
in
an
earthen
vessel
that
they
may
continue
many
days
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
shall
be
possessed
again
in
this
land
now
when
i
had
delivered
the
evidence
of
the
purchase
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
ah
lord
god
behold
thou
hast
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
by
thy
great
power
and
stretched
out
arm
and
there
is
nothing
too
hard
for
thee
thou
shewest
lovingkindness
unto
thousands
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
of
their
children
after
them
the
great
the
mighty
god
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
great
in
counsel
and
mighty
in
work
for
thine
eyes
are
open
upon
all
the
ways
of
the
sons
of
men
to
give
every
one
according
to
his
ways
and
according
to
the
fruit
of
his
doings
which
hast
set
signs
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
and
in
israel
and
among
other
men
and
hast
made
thee
a
name
as
at
this
day
and
hast
brought
forth
thy
people
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
signs
and
with
wonders
and
with
a
strong
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
great
terror
and
hast
given
them
this
land
which
thou
didst
swear
to
their
fathers
to
give
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
they
came
in
and
possessed
it
but
they
obeyed
not
thy
voice
neither
walked
in
thy
law
they
have
done
nothing
of
all
that
thou
commandedst
them
to
do
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
to
come
upon
them
behold
the
mounts
they
are
come
unto
the
city
to
take
it
and
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
it
because
of
the
sword
and
of
the
famine
and
of
the
pestilence
and
what
thou
hast
spoken
is
come
to
pass
and
behold
thou
seest
it
and
thou
hast
said
unto
me
o
lord
god
buy
thee
the
field
for
money
and
take
witnesses
for
the
city
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
behold
i
am
the
lord
the
god
of
all
flesh
is
there
any
thing
too
hard
for
me
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
and
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take
it
and
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
this
city
shall
come
and
set
fire
on
this
city
and
burn
it
with
the
houses
upon
whose
roofs
they
have
offered
incense
unto
baal
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
to
provoke
me
to
anger
for
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
judah
have
only
done
evil
before
me
from
their
youth
for
the
children
of
israel
have
only
provoked
me
to
anger
with
the
work
of
their
hands
saith
the
lord
for
this
city
hath
been
to
me
as
a
provocation
of
mine
anger
and
of
my
fury
from
the
day
that
they
built
it
even
unto
this
day
that
i
should
remove
it
from
before
my
face
because
of
all
the
evil
of
the
children
of
israel
and
of
the
children
of
judah
which
they
have
done
to
provoke
me
to
anger
they
their
kings
their
princes
their
priests
and
their
prophets
and
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
they
have
turned
unto
me
the
back
and
not
the
face
though
i
taught
them
rising
up
early
and
teaching
them
yet
they
have
not
hearkened
to
receive
instruction
but
they
set
their
abominations
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
to
defile
it
and
they
built
the
high
places
of
baal
which
are
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
to
cause
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
unto
molech
which
i
commanded
them
not
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
that
they
should
do
this
abomination
to
cause
judah
to
sin
and
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
concerning
this
city
whereof
ye
say
it
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
behold
i
will
gather
them
out
of
all
countries
whither
i
have
driven
them
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
in
great
wrath
and
i
will
bring
them
again
unto
this
place
and
i
will
cause
them
to
dwell
safely
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
and
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
one
way
that
they
may
fear
me
for
ever
for
the
good
of
them
and
of
their
children
after
them
and
i
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them
that
i
will
not
turn
away
from
them
to
do
them
good
but
i
will
put
my
fear
in
their
hearts
that
they
shall
not
depart
from
me
yea
i
will
rejoice
over
them
to
do
them
good
and
i
will
plant
them
in
this
land
assuredly
with
my
whole
heart
and
with
my
whole
soul
for
thus
saith
the
lord
like
as
i
have
brought
all
this
great
evil
upon
this
people
so
will
i
bring
upon
them
all
the
good
that
i
have
promised
them
and
fields
shall
be
bought
in
this
land
whereof
ye
say
it
is
desolate
without
man
or
beast
it
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
men
shall
buy
fields
for
money
and
subscribe
evidences
and
seal
them
and
take
witnesses
in
the
land
of
benjamin
and
in
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
of
the
mountains
and
in
the
cities
of
the
valley
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south
for
i
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return
saith
the
lord
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
the
second
time
while
he
was
yet
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
maker
thereof
the
lord
that
formed
it
to
establish
it
the
lord
is
his
name
call
unto
me
and
i
will
answer
thee
and
shew
thee
great
and
mighty
things
which
thou
knowest
not
for
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
concerning
the
houses
of
this
city
and
concerning
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
judah
which
are
thrown
down
by
the
mounts
and
by
the
sword
they
come
to
fight
with
the
chaldeans
but
it
is
to
fill
them
with
the
dead
bodies
of
men
whom
i
have
slain
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
for
all
whose
wickedness
i
have
hid
my
face
from
this
city
behold
i
will
bring
it
health
and
cure
and
i
will
cure
them
and
will
reveal
unto
them
the
abundance
of
peace
and
truth
and
i
will
cause
the
captivity
of
judah
and
the
captivity
of
israel
to
return
and
will
build
them
as
at
the
first
and
i
will
cleanse
them
from
all
their
iniquity
whereby
they
have
sinned
against
me
and
i
will
pardon
all
their
iniquities
whereby
they
have
sinned
and
whereby
they
have
transgressed
against
me
and
it
shall
be
to
me
a
name
of
joy
a
praise
and
an
honour
before
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
which
shall
hear
all
the
good
that
i
do
unto
them
and
they
shall
fear
and
tremble
for
all
the
goodness
and
for
all
the
prosperity
that
i
procure
unto
it
thus
saith
the
lord
again
there
shall
be
heard
in
this
place
which
ye
say
shall
be
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast
even
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
that
are
desolate
without
man
and
without
inhabitant
and
without
beast
the
voice
of
joy
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
voice
of
them
that
shall
say
praise
the
lord
of
hosts
for
the
lord
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
and
of
them
that
shall
bring
the
sacrifice
of
praise
into
the
house
of
the
lord
for
i
will
cause
to
return
the
captivity
of
the
land
as
at
the
first
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
again
in
this
place
which
is
desolate
without
man
and
without
beast
and
in
all
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
an
habitation
of
shepherds
causing
their
flocks
to
lie
down
in
the
cities
of
the
mountains
in
the
cities
of
the
vale
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south
and
in
the
land
of
benjamin
and
in
the
places
about
jerusalem
and
in
the
cities
of
judah
shall
the
flocks
pass
again
under
the
hands
of
him
that
telleth
them
saith
the
lord
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
perform
that
good
thing
which
i
have
promised
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
to
the
house
of
judah
in
those
days
and
at
that
time
will
i
cause
the
branch
of
righteousness
to
grow
up
unto
david
and
he
shall
execute
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
land
in
those
days
shall
judah
be
saved
and
jerusalem
shall
dwell
safely
and
this
is
the
name
wherewith
she
shall
be
called
the
lord
our
righteousness
for
thus
saith
the
lord
david
shall
never
want
a
man
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
house
of
israel
neither
shall
the
priests
the
levites
want
a
man
before
me
to
offer
burnt
offerings
and
to
kindle
meat
offerings
and
to
do
sacrifice
continually
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
if
ye
can
break
my
covenant
of
the
day
and
my
covenant
of
the
night
and
that
there
should
not
be
day
and
night
in
their
season
then
may
also
my
covenant
be
broken
with
david
my
servant
that
he
should
not
have
a
son
to
reign
upon
his
throne
and
with
the
levites
the
priests
my
ministers
as
the
host
of
heaven
cannot
be
numbered
neither
the
sand
of
the
sea
measured
so
will
i
multiply
the
seed
of
david
my
servant
and
the
levites
that
minister
unto
me
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
saying
considerest
thou
not
what
this
people
have
spoken
saying
the
two
families
which
the
lord
hath
chosen
he
hath
even
cast
them
off
thus
they
have
despised
my
people
that
they
should
be
no
more
a
nation
before
them
thus
saith
the
lord
if
my
covenant
be
not
with
day
and
night
and
if
i
have
not
appointed
the
ordinances
of
heaven
and
earth
then
will
i
cast
away
the
seed
of
jacob
and
david
my
servant
so
that
i
will
not
take
any
of
his
seed
to
be
rulers
over
the
seed
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
for
i
will
cause
their
captivity
to
return
and
have
mercy
on
them
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
when
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
all
his
army
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
of
his
dominion
and
all
the
people
fought
against
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
thereof
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
go
and
speak
to
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
tell
him
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
burn
it
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
his
hand
but
shalt
surely
be
taken
and
delivered
into
his
hand
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
speak
with
thee
mouth
to
mouth
and
thou
shalt
go
to
babylon
yet
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
zedekiah
king
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
of
thee
thou
shalt
not
die
by
the
sword
but
thou
shalt
die
in
peace
and
with
the
burnings
of
thy
fathers
the
former
kings
which
were
before
thee
so
shall
they
burn
odours
for
thee
and
they
will
lament
thee
saying
ah
lord
for
i
have
pronounced
the
word
saith
the
lord
then
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
all
these
words
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
jerusalem
when
the
king
of
babylon's
army
fought
against
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
of
judah
that
were
left
against
lachish
and
against
azekah
for
these
defenced
cities
remained
of
the
cities
of
judah
this
is
the
word
that
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
after
that
the
king
zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
which
were
at
jerusalem
to
proclaim
liberty
unto
them
that
every
man
should
let
his
manservant
and
every
man
his
maidservant
being
an
hebrew
or
an
hebrewess
go
free
that
none
should
serve
himself
of
them
to
wit
of
a
jew
his
brother
now
when
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
which
had
entered
into
the
covenant
heard
that
every
one
should
let
his
manservant
and
every
one
his
maidservant
go
free
that
none
should
serve
themselves
of
them
any
more
then
they
obeyed
and
let
them
go
but
afterward
they
turned
and
caused
the
servants
and
the
handmaids
whom
they
had
let
go
free
to
return
and
brought
them
into
subjection
for
servants
and
for
handmaids
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
i
made
a
covenant
with
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen
saying
at
the
end
of
seven
years
let
ye
go
every
man
his
brother
an
hebrew
which
hath
been
sold
unto
thee
and
when
he
hath
served
thee
six
years
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee
but
your
fathers
hearkened
not
unto
me
neither
inclined
their
ear
and
ye
were
now
turned
and
had
done
right
in
my
sight
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
man
to
his
neighbour
and
ye
had
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
but
ye
turned
and
polluted
my
name
and
caused
every
man
his
servant
and
every
man
his
handmaid
whom
ye
had
set
at
liberty
at
their
pleasure
to
return
and
brought
them
into
subjection
to
be
unto
you
for
servants
and
for
handmaids
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
me
in
proclaiming
liberty
every
one
to
his
brother
and
every
man
to
his
neighbour
behold
i
proclaim
a
liberty
for
you
saith
the
lord
to
the
sword
to
the
pestilence
and
to
the
famine
and
i
will
make
you
to
be
removed
into
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
i
will
give
the
men
that
have
transgressed
my
covenant
which
have
not
performed
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
before
me
when
they
cut
the
calf
in
twain
and
passed
between
the
parts
thereof
the
princes
of
judah
and
the
princes
of
jerusalem
the
eunuchs
and
the
priests
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
which
passed
between
the
parts
of
the
calf
i
will
even
give
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
be
for
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
his
princes
will
i
give
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
their
life
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon's
army
which
are
gone
up
from
you
behold
i
will
command
saith
the
lord
and
cause
them
to
return
to
this
city
and
they
shall
fight
against
it
and
take
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
and
i
will
make
the
cities
of
judah
a
desolation
without
an
inhabitant
the
word
which
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
in
the
days
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
saying
go
unto
the
house
of
the
rechabites
and
speak
unto
them
and
bring
them
into
the
house
of
the
lord
into
one
of
the
chambers
and
give
them
wine
to
drink
then
i
took
jaazaniah
the
son
of
jeremiah
the
son
of
habaziniah
and
his
brethren
and
all
his
sons
and
the
whole
house
of
the
rechabites
and
i
brought
them
into
the
house
of
the
lord
into
the
chamber
of
the
sons
of
hanan
the
son
of
igdaliah
a
man
of
god
which
was
by
the
chamber
of
the
princes
which
was
above
the
chamber
of
maaseiah
the
son
of
shallum
the
keeper
of
the
door
and
i
set
before
the
sons
of
the
house
of
the
rechabites
pots
full
of
wine
and
cups
and
i
said
unto
them
drink
ye
wine
but
they
said
we
will
drink
no
wine
for
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
our
father
commanded
us
saying
ye
shall
drink
no
wine
neither
ye
nor
your
sons
for
ever
neither
shall
ye
build
house
nor
sow
seed
nor
plant
vineyard
nor
have
any
but
all
your
days
ye
shall
dwell
in
tents
that
ye
may
live
many
days
in
the
land
where
ye
be
strangers
thus
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
our
father
in
all
that
he
hath
charged
us
to
drink
no
wine
all
our
days
we
our
wives
our
sons
nor
our
daughters
nor
to
build
houses
for
us
to
dwell
in
neither
have
we
vineyard
nor
field
nor
seed
but
we
have
dwelt
in
tents
and
have
obeyed
and
done
according
to
all
that
jonadab
our
father
commanded
us
but
it
came
to
pass
when
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
came
up
into
the
land
that
we
said
come
and
let
us
go
to
jerusalem
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
and
for
fear
of
the
army
of
the
syrians
so
we
dwell
at
jerusalem
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
go
and
tell
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
will
ye
not
receive
instruction
to
hearken
to
my
words
saith
the
lord
the
words
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
that
he
commanded
his
sons
not
to
drink
wine
are
performed
for
unto
this
day
they
drink
none
but
obey
their
father's
commandment
notwithstanding
i
have
spoken
unto
you
rising
early
and
speaking
but
ye
hearkened
not
unto
me
i
have
sent
also
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
saying
return
ye
now
every
man
from
his
evil
way
and
amend
your
doings
and
go
not
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
which
i
have
given
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
but
ye
have
not
inclined
your
ear
nor
hearkened
unto
me
because
the
sons
of
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
have
performed
the
commandment
of
their
father
which
he
commanded
them
but
this
people
hath
not
hearkened
unto
me
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
upon
judah
and
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
them
because
i
have
spoken
unto
them
but
they
have
not
heard
and
i
have
called
unto
them
but
they
have
not
answered
and
jeremiah
said
unto
the
house
of
the
rechabites
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
because
ye
have
obeyed
the
commandment
of
jonadab
your
father
and
kept
all
his
precepts
and
done
according
unto
all
that
he
hath
commanded
you
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
shall
not
want
a
man
to
stand
before
me
for
ever
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
that
this
word
came
unto
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
take
thee
a
roll
of
a
book
and
write
therein
all
the
words
that
i
have
spoken
unto
thee
against
israel
and
against
judah
and
against
all
the
nations
from
the
day
i
spake
unto
thee
from
the
days
of
josiah
even
unto
this
day
it
may
be
that
the
house
of
judah
will
hear
all
the
evil
which
i
purpose
to
do
unto
them
that
they
may
return
every
man
from
his
evil
way
that
i
may
forgive
their
iniquity
and
their
sin
then
jeremiah
called
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
and
baruch
wrote
from
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
had
spoken
unto
him
upon
a
roll
of
a
book
and
jeremiah
commanded
baruch
saying
i
am
shut
up
i
cannot
go
into
the
house
of
the
lord
therefore
go
thou
and
read
in
the
roll
which
thou
hast
written
from
my
mouth
the
words
of
the
lord
in
the
ears
of
the
people
in
the
lord's
house
upon
the
fasting
day
and
also
thou
shalt
read
them
in
the
ears
of
all
judah
that
come
out
of
their
cities
it
may
be
they
will
present
their
supplication
before
the
lord
and
will
return
every
one
from
his
evil
way
for
great
is
the
anger
and
the
fury
that
the
lord
hath
pronounced
against
this
people
and
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
did
according
to
all
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
him
reading
in
the
book
the
words
of
the
lord
in
the
lord's
house
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
in
the
ninth
month
that
they
proclaimed
a
fast
before
the
lord
to
all
the
people
in
jerusalem
and
to
all
the
people
that
came
from
the
cities
of
judah
unto
jerusalem
then
read
baruch
in
the
book
the
words
of
jeremiah
in
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
chamber
of
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
the
scribe
in
the
higher
court
at
the
entry
of
the
new
gate
of
the
lord's
house
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people
when
michaiah
the
son
of
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
had
heard
out
of
the
book
all
the
words
of
the
lord
then
he
went
down
into
the
king's
house
into
the
scribe's
chamber
and
lo
all
the
princes
sat
there
even
elishama
the
scribe
and
delaiah
the
son
of
shemaiah
and
elnathan
the
son
of
achbor
and
gemariah
the
son
of
shaphan
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
hananiah
and
all
the
princes
then
michaiah
declared
unto
them
all
the
words
that
he
had
heard
when
baruch
read
the
book
in
the
ears
of
the
people
therefore
all
the
princes
sent
jehudi
the
son
of
nethaniah
the
son
of
shelemiah
the
son
of
cushi
unto
baruch
saying
take
in
thine
hand
the
roll
wherein
thou
hast
read
in
the
ears
of
the
people
and
come
so
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
took
the
roll
in
his
hand
and
came
unto
them
and
they
said
unto
him
sit
down
now
and
read
it
in
our
ears
so
baruch
read
it
in
their
ears
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
heard
all
the
words
they
were
afraid
both
one
and
other
and
said
unto
baruch
we
will
surely
tell
the
king
of
all
these
words
and
they
asked
baruch
saying
tell
us
now
how
didst
thou
write
all
these
words
at
his
mouth
then
baruch
answered
them
he
pronounced
all
these
words
unto
me
with
his
mouth
and
i
wrote
them
with
ink
in
the
book
then
said
the
princes
unto
baruch
go
hide
thee
thou
and
jeremiah
and
let
no
man
know
where
ye
be
and
they
went
in
to
the
king
into
the
court
but
they
laid
up
the
roll
in
the
chamber
of
elishama
the
scribe
and
told
all
the
words
in
the
ears
of
the
king
so
the
king
sent
jehudi
to
fetch
the
roll
and
he
took
it
out
of
elishama
the
scribe's
chamber
and
jehudi
read
it
in
the
ears
of
the
king
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
princes
which
stood
beside
the
king
now
the
king
sat
in
the
winterhouse
in
the
ninth
month
and
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
burning
before
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jehudi
had
read
three
or
four
leaves
he
cut
it
with
the
penknife
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth
until
all
the
roll
was
consumed
in
the
fire
that
was
on
the
hearth
yet
they
were
not
afraid
nor
rent
their
garments
neither
the
king
nor
any
of
his
servants
that
heard
all
these
words
nevertheless
elnathan
and
delaiah
and
gemariah
had
made
intercession
to
the
king
that
he
would
not
burn
the
roll
but
he
would
not
hear
them
but
the
king
commanded
jerahmeel
the
son
of
hammelech
and
seraiah
the
son
of
azriel
and
shelemiah
the
son
of
abdeel
to
take
baruch
the
scribe
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
but
the
lord
hid
them
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
after
that
the
king
had
burned
the
roll
and
the
words
which
baruch
wrote
at
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
saying
take
thee
again
another
roll
and
write
in
it
all
the
former
words
that
were
in
the
first
roll
which
jehoiakim
the
king
of
judah
hath
burned
and
thou
shalt
say
to
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
hast
burned
this
roll
saying
why
hast
thou
written
therein
saying
the
king
of
babylon
shall
certainly
come
and
destroy
this
land
and
shall
cause
to
cease
from
thence
man
and
beast
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
he
shall
have
none
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
his
dead
body
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
day
to
the
heat
and
in
the
night
to
the
frost
and
i
will
punish
him
and
his
seed
and
his
servants
for
their
iniquity
and
i
will
bring
upon
them
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
upon
the
men
of
judah
all
the
evil
that
i
have
pronounced
against
them
but
they
hearkened
not
then
took
jeremiah
another
roll
and
gave
it
to
baruch
the
scribe
the
son
of
neriah
who
wrote
therein
from
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
had
burned
in
the
fire
and
there
were
added
besides
unto
them
many
like
words
and
king
zedekiah
the
son
of
josiah
reigned
instead
of
coniah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
whom
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
made
king
in
the
land
of
judah
but
neither
he
nor
his
servants
nor
the
people
of
the
land
did
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
the
prophet
jeremiah
and
zedekiah
the
king
sent
jehucal
the
son
of
shelemiah
and
zephaniah
the
son
of
maaseiah
the
priest
to
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
pray
now
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
us
now
jeremiah
came
in
and
went
out
among
the
people
for
they
had
not
put
him
into
prison
then
pharaoh's
army
was
come
forth
out
of
egypt
and
when
the
chaldeans
that
besieged
jerusalem
heard
tidings
of
them
they
departed
from
jerusalem
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
the
prophet
jeremiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
thus
shall
ye
say
to
the
king
of
judah
that
sent
you
unto
me
to
enquire
of
me
behold
pharaoh's
army
which
is
come
forth
to
help
you
shall
return
to
egypt
into
their
own
land
and
the
chaldeans
shall
come
again
and
fight
against
this
city
and
take
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
thus
saith
the
lord
deceive
not
yourselves
saying
the
chaldeans
shall
surely
depart
from
us
for
they
shall
not
depart
for
though
ye
had
smitten
the
whole
army
of
the
chaldeans
that
fight
against
you
and
there
remained
but
wounded
men
among
them
yet
should
they
rise
up
every
man
in
his
tent
and
burn
this
city
with
fire
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
was
broken
up
from
jerusalem
for
fear
of
pharaoh's
army
then
jeremiah
went
forth
out
of
jerusalem
to
go
into
the
land
of
benjamin
to
separate
himself
thence
in
the
midst
of
the
people
and
when
he
was
in
the
gate
of
benjamin
a
captain
of
the
ward
was
there
whose
name
was
irijah
the
son
of
shelemiah
the
son
of
hananiah
and
he
took
jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
thou
fallest
away
to
the
chaldeans
then
said
jeremiah
it
is
false
i
fall
not
away
to
the
chaldeans
but
he
hearkened
not
to
him
so
irijah
took
jeremiah
and
brought
him
to
the
princes
wherefore
the
princes
were
wroth
with
jeremiah
and
smote
him
and
put
him
in
prison
in
the
house
of
jonathan
the
scribe
for
they
had
made
that
the
prison
when
jeremiah
was
entered
into
the
dungeon
and
into
the
cabins
and
jeremiah
had
remained
there
many
days
then
zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
took
him
out
and
the
king
asked
him
secretly
in
his
house
and
said
is
there
any
word
from
the
lord
and
jeremiah
said
there
is
for
said
he
thou
shalt
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
moreover
jeremiah
said
unto
king
zedekiah
what
have
i
offended
against
thee
or
against
thy
servants
or
against
this
people
that
ye
have
put
me
in
prison
where
are
now
your
prophets
which
prophesied
unto
you
saying
the
king
of
babylon
shall
not
come
against
you
nor
against
this
land
therefore
hear
now
i
pray
thee
o
my
lord
the
king
let
my
supplication
i
pray
thee
be
accepted
before
thee
that
thou
cause
me
not
to
return
to
the
house
of
jonathan
the
scribe
lest
i
die
there
then
zedekiah
the
king
commanded
that
they
should
commit
jeremiah
into
the
court
of
the
prison
and
that
they
should
give
him
daily
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
the
bakers
street
until
all
the
bread
in
the
city
were
spent
thus
jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison
then
shephatiah
the
son
of
mattan
and
gedaliah
the
son
of
pashur
and
jucal
the
son
of
shelemiah
and
pashur
the
son
of
malchiah
heard
the
words
that
jeremiah
had
spoken
unto
all
the
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
he
that
remaineth
in
this
city
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
but
he
that
goeth
forth
to
the
chaldeans
shall
live
for
he
shall
have
his
life
for
a
prey
and
shall
live
thus
saith
the
lord
this
city
shall
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon's
army
which
shall
take
it
therefore
the
princes
said
unto
the
king
we
beseech
thee
let
this
man
be
put
to
death
for
thus
he
weakeneth
the
hands
of
the
men
of
war
that
remain
in
this
city
and
the
hands
of
all
the
people
in
speaking
such
words
unto
them
for
this
man
seeketh
not
the
welfare
of
this
people
but
the
hurt
then
zedekiah
the
king
said
behold
he
is
in
your
hand
for
the
king
is
not
he
that
can
do
any
thing
against
you
then
took
they
jeremiah
and
cast
him
into
the
dungeon
of
malchiah
the
son
of
hammelech
that
was
in
the
court
of
the
prison
and
they
let
down
jeremiah
with
cords
and
in
the
dungeon
there
was
no
water
but
mire
so
jeremiah
sunk
in
the
mire
now
when
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
one
of
the
eunuchs
which
was
in
the
king's
house
heard
that
they
had
put
jeremiah
in
the
dungeon
the
king
then
sitting
in
the
gate
of
benjamin
ebedmelech
went
forth
out
of
the
king's
house
and
spake
to
the
king
saying
my
lord
the
king
these
men
have
done
evil
in
all
that
they
have
done
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
whom
they
have
cast
into
the
dungeon
and
he
is
like
to
die
for
hunger
in
the
place
where
he
is
for
there
is
no
more
bread
in
the
city
then
the
king
commanded
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
saying
take
from
hence
thirty
men
with
thee
and
take
up
jeremiah
the
prophet
out
of
the
dungeon
before
he
die
so
ebedmelech
took
the
men
with
him
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
king
under
the
treasury
and
took
thence
old
cast
clouts
and
old
rotten
rags
and
let
them
down
by
cords
into
the
dungeon
to
jeremiah
and
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
said
unto
jeremiah
put
now
these
old
cast
clouts
and
rotten
rags
under
thine
armholes
under
the
cords
and
jeremiah
did
so
so
they
drew
up
jeremiah
with
cords
and
took
him
up
out
of
the
dungeon
and
jeremiah
remained
in
the
court
of
the
prison
then
zedekiah
the
king
sent
and
took
jeremiah
the
prophet
unto
him
into
the
third
entry
that
is
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king
said
unto
jeremiah
i
will
ask
thee
a
thing
hide
nothing
from
me
then
jeremiah
said
unto
zedekiah
if
i
declare
it
unto
thee
wilt
thou
not
surely
put
me
to
death
and
if
i
give
thee
counsel
wilt
thou
not
hearken
unto
me
so
zedekiah
the
king
sware
secretly
unto
jeremiah
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
that
made
us
this
soul
i
will
not
put
thee
to
death
neither
will
i
give
thee
into
the
hand
of
these
men
that
seek
thy
life
then
said
jeremiah
unto
zedekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
if
thou
wilt
assuredly
go
forth
unto
the
king
of
babylon's
princes
then
thy
soul
shall
live
and
this
city
shall
not
be
burned
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
live
and
thine
house
but
if
thou
wilt
not
go
forth
to
the
king
of
babylon's
princes
then
shall
this
city
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
and
they
shall
burn
it
with
fire
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
and
zedekiah
the
king
said
unto
jeremiah
i
am
afraid
of
the
jews
that
are
fallen
to
the
chaldeans
lest
they
deliver
me
into
their
hand
and
they
mock
me
but
jeremiah
said
they
shall
not
deliver
thee
obey
i
beseech
thee
the
voice
of
the
lord
which
i
speak
unto
thee
so
it
shall
be
well
unto
thee
and
thy
soul
shall
live
but
if
thou
refuse
to
go
forth
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
and
behold
all
the
women
that
are
left
in
the
king
of
judah's
house
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
king
of
babylon's
princes
and
those
women
shall
say
thy
friends
have
set
thee
on
and
have
prevailed
against
thee
thy
feet
are
sunk
in
the
mire
and
they
are
turned
away
back
so
they
shall
bring
out
all
thy
wives
and
thy
children
to
the
chaldeans
and
thou
shalt
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
but
shalt
be
taken
by
the
hand
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
thou
shalt
cause
this
city
to
be
burned
with
fire
then
said
zedekiah
unto
jeremiah
let
no
man
know
of
these
words
and
thou
shalt
not
die
but
if
the
princes
hear
that
i
have
talked
with
thee
and
they
come
unto
thee
and
say
unto
thee
declare
unto
us
now
what
thou
hast
said
unto
the
king
hide
it
not
from
us
and
we
will
not
put
thee
to
death
also
what
the
king
said
unto
thee
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
i
presented
my
supplication
before
the
king
that
he
would
not
cause
me
to
return
to
jonathan's
house
to
die
there
then
came
all
the
princes
unto
jeremiah
and
asked
him
and
he
told
them
according
to
all
these
words
that
the
king
had
commanded
so
they
left
off
speaking
with
him
for
the
matter
was
not
perceived
so
jeremiah
abode
in
the
court
of
the
prison
until
the
day
that
jerusalem
was
taken
and
he
was
there
when
jerusalem
was
taken
in
the
ninth
year
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
in
the
tenth
month
came
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
all
his
army
against
jerusalem
and
they
besieged
it
and
in
the
eleventh
year
of
zedekiah
in
the
fourth
month
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
city
was
broken
up
and
all
the
princes
of
the
king
of
babylon
came
in
and
sat
in
the
middle
gate
even
nergalsharezer
samgarnebo
sarsechim
rabsaris
nergalsharezer
rabmag
with
all
the
residue
of
the
princes
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
saw
them
and
all
the
men
of
war
then
they
fled
and
went
forth
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
king's
garden
by
the
gate
betwixt
the
two
walls
and
he
went
out
the
way
of
the
plain
but
the
chaldeans
army
pursued
after
them
and
overtook
zedekiah
in
the
plains
of
jericho
and
when
they
had
taken
him
they
brought
him
up
to
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
to
riblah
in
the
land
of
hamath
where
he
gave
judgment
upon
him
then
the
king
of
babylon
slew
the
sons
of
zedekiah
in
riblah
before
his
eyes
also
the
king
of
babylon
slew
all
the
nobles
of
judah
moreover
he
put
out
zedekiah's
eyes
and
bound
him
with
chains
to
carry
him
to
babylon
and
the
chaldeans
burned
the
king's
house
and
the
houses
of
the
people
with
fire
and
brake
down
the
walls
of
jerusalem
then
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
the
remnant
of
the
people
that
remained
in
the
city
and
those
that
fell
away
that
fell
to
him
with
the
rest
of
the
people
that
remained
but
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
left
of
the
poor
of
the
people
which
had
nothing
in
the
land
of
judah
and
gave
them
vineyards
and
fields
at
the
same
time
now
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
gave
charge
concerning
jeremiah
to
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
saying
take
him
and
look
well
to
him
and
do
him
no
harm
but
do
unto
him
even
as
he
shall
say
unto
thee
so
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
sent
and
nebushasban
rabsaris
and
nergalsharezer
rabmag
and
all
the
king
of
babylon's
princes
even
they
sent
and
took
jeremiah
out
of
the
court
of
the
prison
and
committed
him
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
that
he
should
carry
him
home
so
he
dwelt
among
the
people
now
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
while
he
was
shut
up
in
the
court
of
the
prison
saying
go
and
speak
to
ebedmelech
the
ethiopian
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
bring
my
words
upon
this
city
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
they
shall
be
accomplished
in
that
day
before
thee
but
i
will
deliver
thee
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
and
thou
shalt
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
men
of
whom
thou
art
afraid
for
i
will
surely
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
fall
by
the
sword
but
thy
life
shall
be
for
a
prey
unto
thee
because
thou
hast
put
thy
trust
in
me
saith
the
lord
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
after
that
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
let
him
go
from
ramah
when
he
had
taken
him
being
bound
in
chains
among
all
that
were
carried
away
captive
of
jerusalem
and
judah
which
were
carried
away
captive
unto
babylon
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
took
jeremiah
and
said
unto
him
the
lord
thy
god
hath
pronounced
this
evil
upon
this
place
now
the
lord
hath
brought
it
and
done
according
as
he
hath
said
because
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
have
not
obeyed
his
voice
therefore
this
thing
is
come
upon
you
and
now
behold
i
loose
thee
this
day
from
the
chains
which
were
upon
thine
hand
if
it
seem
good
unto
thee
to
come
with
me
into
babylon
come
and
i
will
look
well
unto
thee
but
if
it
seem
ill
unto
thee
to
come
with
me
into
babylon
forbear
behold
all
the
land
is
before
thee
whither
it
seemeth
good
and
convenient
for
thee
to
go
thither
go
now
while
he
was
not
yet
gone
back
he
said
go
back
also
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
whom
the
king
of
babylon
hath
made
governor
over
the
cities
of
judah
and
dwell
with
him
among
the
people
or
go
wheresoever
it
seemeth
convenient
unto
thee
to
go
so
the
captain
of
the
guard
gave
him
victuals
and
a
reward
and
let
him
go
then
went
jeremiah
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
to
mizpah
and
dwelt
with
him
among
the
people
that
were
left
in
the
land
now
when
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
which
were
in
the
fields
even
they
and
their
men
heard
that
the
king
of
babylon
had
made
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
governor
in
the
land
and
had
committed
unto
him
men
and
women
and
children
and
of
the
poor
of
the
land
of
them
that
were
not
carried
away
captive
to
babylon
then
they
came
to
gedaliah
to
mizpah
even
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
johanan
and
jonathan
the
sons
of
kareah
and
seraiah
the
son
of
tanhumeth
and
the
sons
of
ephai
the
netophathite
and
jezaniah
the
son
of
a
maachathite
they
and
their
men
and
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
sware
unto
them
and
to
their
men
saying
fear
not
to
serve
the
chaldeans
dwell
in
the
land
and
serve
the
king
of
babylon
and
it
shall
be
well
with
you
as
for
me
behold
i
will
dwell
at
mizpah
to
serve
the
chaldeans
which
will
come
unto
us
but
ye
gather
ye
wine
and
summer
fruits
and
oil
and
put
them
in
your
vessels
and
dwell
in
your
cities
that
ye
have
taken
likewise
when
all
the
jews
that
were
in
moab
and
among
the
ammonites
and
in
edom
and
that
were
in
all
the
countries
heard
that
the
king
of
babylon
had
left
a
remnant
of
judah
and
that
he
had
set
over
them
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
even
all
the
jews
returned
out
of
all
places
whither
they
were
driven
and
came
to
the
land
of
judah
to
gedaliah
unto
mizpah
and
gathered
wine
and
summer
fruits
very
much
moreover
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
in
the
fields
came
to
gedaliah
to
mizpah
and
said
unto
him
dost
thou
certainly
know
that
baalis
the
king
of
the
ammonites
hath
sent
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
to
slay
thee
but
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
believed
them
not
then
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
spake
to
gedaliah
in
mizpah
secretly
saying
let
me
go
i
pray
thee
and
i
will
slay
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
no
man
shall
know
it
wherefore
should
he
slay
thee
that
all
the
jews
which
are
gathered
unto
thee
should
be
scattered
and
the
remnant
in
judah
perish
but
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
said
unto
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
thou
shalt
not
do
this
thing
for
thou
speakest
falsely
of
ishmael
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
month
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
the
son
of
elishama
of
the
seed
royal
and
the
princes
of
the
king
even
ten
men
with
him
came
unto
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
to
mizpah
and
there
they
did
eat
bread
together
in
mizpah
then
arose
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
the
ten
men
that
were
with
him
and
smote
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
with
the
sword
and
slew
him
whom
the
king
of
babylon
had
made
governor
over
the
land
ishmael
also
slew
all
the
jews
that
were
with
him
even
with
gedaliah
at
mizpah
and
the
chaldeans
that
were
found
there
and
the
men
of
war
and
it
came
to
pass
the
second
day
after
he
had
slain
gedaliah
and
no
man
knew
it
that
there
came
certain
from
shechem
from
shiloh
and
from
samaria
even
fourscore
men
having
their
beards
shaven
and
their
clothes
rent
and
having
cut
themselves
with
offerings
and
incense
in
their
hand
to
bring
them
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
went
forth
from
mizpah
to
meet
them
weeping
all
along
as
he
went
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
met
them
he
said
unto
them
come
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
and
it
was
so
when
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
city
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
slew
them
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
the
pit
he
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
but
ten
men
were
found
among
them
that
said
unto
ishmael
slay
us
not
for
we
have
treasures
in
the
field
of
wheat
and
of
barley
and
of
oil
and
of
honey
so
he
forbare
and
slew
them
not
among
their
brethren
now
the
pit
wherein
ishmael
had
cast
all
the
dead
bodies
of
the
men
whom
he
had
slain
because
of
gedaliah
was
it
which
asa
the
king
had
made
for
fear
of
baasha
king
of
israel
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
filled
it
with
them
that
were
slain
then
ishmael
carried
away
captive
all
the
residue
of
the
people
that
were
in
mizpah
even
the
king's
daughters
and
all
the
people
that
remained
in
mizpah
whom
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
committed
to
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
and
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
carried
them
away
captive
and
departed
to
go
over
to
the
ammonites
but
when
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
heard
of
all
the
evil
that
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
had
done
then
they
took
all
the
men
and
went
to
fight
with
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
and
found
him
by
the
great
waters
that
are
in
gibeon
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
all
the
people
which
were
with
ishmael
saw
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
then
they
were
glad
so
all
the
people
that
ishmael
had
carried
away
captive
from
mizpah
cast
about
and
returned
and
went
unto
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
but
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
escaped
from
johanan
with
eight
men
and
went
to
the
ammonites
then
took
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
that
were
with
him
all
the
remnant
of
the
people
whom
he
had
recovered
from
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
from
mizpah
after
that
he
had
slain
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
even
mighty
men
of
war
and
the
women
and
the
children
and
the
eunuchs
whom
he
had
brought
again
from
gibeon
and
they
departed
and
dwelt
in
the
habitation
of
chimham
which
is
by
bethlehem
to
go
to
enter
into
egypt
because
of
the
chaldeans
for
they
were
afraid
of
them
because
ishmael
the
son
of
nethaniah
had
slain
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
whom
the
king
of
babylon
made
governor
in
the
land
then
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
and
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
jezaniah
the
son
of
hoshaiah
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
came
near
and
said
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
let
we
beseech
thee
our
supplication
be
accepted
before
thee
and
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
thy
god
even
for
all
this
remnant
for
we
are
left
but
a
few
of
many
as
thine
eyes
do
behold
us
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
shew
us
the
way
wherein
we
may
walk
and
the
thing
that
we
may
do
then
jeremiah
the
prophet
said
unto
them
i
have
heard
you
behold
i
will
pray
unto
the
lord
your
god
according
to
your
words
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whatsoever
thing
the
lord
shall
answer
you
i
will
declare
it
unto
you
i
will
keep
nothing
back
from
you
then
they
said
to
jeremiah
the
lord
be
a
true
and
faithful
witness
between
us
if
we
do
not
even
according
to
all
things
for
the
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
send
thee
to
us
whether
it
be
good
or
whether
it
be
evil
we
will
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
to
whom
we
send
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
us
when
we
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
and
it
came
to
pass
after
ten
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jeremiah
then
called
he
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
which
were
with
him
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
even
to
the
greatest
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
unto
whom
ye
sent
me
to
present
your
supplication
before
him
if
ye
will
still
abide
in
this
land
then
will
i
build
you
and
not
pull
you
down
and
i
will
plant
you
and
not
pluck
you
up
for
i
repent
me
of
the
evil
that
i
have
done
unto
you
be
not
afraid
of
the
king
of
babylon
of
whom
ye
are
afraid
be
not
afraid
of
him
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
with
you
to
save
you
and
to
deliver
you
from
his
hand
and
i
will
shew
mercies
unto
you
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
you
and
cause
you
to
return
to
your
own
land
but
if
ye
say
we
will
not
dwell
in
this
land
neither
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
saying
no
but
we
will
go
into
the
land
of
egypt
where
we
shall
see
no
war
nor
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
nor
have
hunger
of
bread
and
there
will
we
dwell
and
now
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
remnant
of
judah
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
if
ye
wholly
set
your
faces
to
enter
into
egypt
and
go
to
sojourn
there
then
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
sword
which
ye
feared
shall
overtake
you
there
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
famine
whereof
ye
were
afraid
shall
follow
close
after
you
there
in
egypt
and
there
ye
shall
die
so
shall
it
be
with
all
the
men
that
set
their
faces
to
go
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
they
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
and
none
of
them
shall
remain
or
escape
from
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
them
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
as
mine
anger
and
my
fury
hath
been
poured
forth
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
so
shall
my
fury
be
poured
forth
upon
you
when
ye
shall
enter
into
egypt
and
ye
shall
be
an
execration
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
and
a
reproach
and
ye
shall
see
this
place
no
more
the
lord
hath
said
concerning
you
o
ye
remnant
of
judah
go
ye
not
into
egypt
know
certainly
that
i
have
admonished
you
this
day
for
ye
dissembled
in
your
hearts
when
ye
sent
me
unto
the
lord
your
god
saying
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
our
god
and
according
unto
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
say
so
declare
unto
us
and
we
will
do
it
and
now
i
have
this
day
declared
it
to
you
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
nor
any
thing
for
the
which
he
hath
sent
me
unto
you
now
therefore
know
certainly
that
ye
shall
die
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
in
the
place
whither
ye
desire
to
go
and
to
sojourn
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jeremiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
all
the
people
all
the
words
of
the
lord
their
god
for
which
the
lord
their
god
had
sent
him
to
them
even
all
these
words
then
spake
azariah
the
son
of
hoshaiah
and
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
proud
men
saying
unto
jeremiah
thou
speakest
falsely
the
lord
our
god
hath
not
sent
thee
to
say
go
not
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
but
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
setteth
thee
on
against
us
for
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
chaldeans
that
they
might
put
us
to
death
and
carry
us
away
captives
into
babylon
so
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
and
all
the
people
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
judah
but
johanan
the
son
of
kareah
and
all
the
captains
of
the
forces
took
all
the
remnant
of
judah
that
were
returned
from
all
nations
whither
they
had
been
driven
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
judah
even
men
and
women
and
children
and
the
king's
daughters
and
every
person
that
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the
guard
had
left
with
gedaliah
the
son
of
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
jeremiah
the
prophet
and
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
so
they
came
into
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
thus
came
they
even
to
tahpanhes
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
jeremiah
in
tahpanhes
saying
take
great
stones
in
thine
hand
and
hide
them
in
the
clay
in
the
brickkiln
which
is
at
the
entry
of
pharaoh's
house
in
tahpanhes
in
the
sight
of
the
men
of
judah
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
send
and
take
nebuchadrezzar
the
king
of
babylon
my
servant
and
will
set
his
throne
upon
these
stones
that
i
have
hid
and
he
shall
spread
his
royal
pavilion
over
them
and
when
he
cometh
he
shall
smite
the
land
of
egypt
and
deliver
such
as
are
for
death
to
death
and
such
as
are
for
captivity
to
captivity
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword
to
the
sword
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
egypt
and
he
shall
burn
them
and
carry
them
away
captives
and
he
shall
array
himself
with
the
land
of
egypt
as
a
shepherd
putteth
on
his
garment
and
he
shall
go
forth
from
thence
in
peace
he
shall
break
also
the
images
of
bethshemesh
that
is
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
the
egyptians
shall
he
burn
with
fire
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
all
the
jews
which
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
which
dwell
at
migdol
and
at
tahpanhes
and
at
noph
and
in
the
country
of
pathros
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
ye
have
seen
all
the
evil
that
i
have
brought
upon
jerusalem
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
behold
this
day
they
are
a
desolation
and
no
man
dwelleth
therein
because
of
their
wickedness
which
they
have
committed
to
provoke
me
to
anger
in
that
they
went
to
burn
incense
and
to
serve
other
gods
whom
they
knew
not
neither
they
ye
nor
your
fathers
howbeit
i
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
rising
early
and
sending
them
saying
oh
do
not
this
abominable
thing
that
i
hate
but
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
to
turn
from
their
wickedness
to
burn
no
incense
unto
other
gods
wherefore
my
fury
and
mine
anger
was
poured
forth
and
was
kindled
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
they
are
wasted
and
desolate
as
at
this
day
therefore
now
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
wherefore
commit
ye
this
great
evil
against
your
souls
to
cut
off
from
you
man
and
woman
child
and
suckling
out
of
judah
to
leave
you
none
to
remain
in
that
ye
provoke
me
unto
wrath
with
the
works
of
your
hands
burning
incense
unto
other
gods
in
the
land
of
egypt
whither
ye
be
gone
to
dwell
that
ye
might
cut
yourselves
off
and
that
ye
might
be
a
curse
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
have
ye
forgotten
the
wickedness
of
your
fathers
and
the
wickedness
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
the
wickedness
of
their
wives
and
your
own
wickedness
and
the
wickedness
of
your
wives
which
they
have
committed
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
they
are
not
humbled
even
unto
this
day
neither
have
they
feared
nor
walked
in
my
law
nor
in
my
statutes
that
i
set
before
you
and
before
your
fathers
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
set
my
face
against
you
for
evil
and
to
cut
off
all
judah
and
i
will
take
the
remnant
of
judah
that
have
set
their
faces
to
go
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
and
they
shall
all
be
consumed
and
fall
in
the
land
of
egypt
they
shall
even
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
they
shall
die
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
they
shall
be
an
execration
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
and
a
reproach
for
i
will
punish
them
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
as
i
have
punished
jerusalem
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
so
that
none
of
the
remnant
of
judah
which
are
gone
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
shall
escape
or
remain
that
they
should
return
into
the
land
of
judah
to
the
which
they
have
a
desire
to
return
to
dwell
there
for
none
shall
return
but
such
as
shall
escape
then
all
the
men
which
knew
that
their
wives
had
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
and
all
the
women
that
stood
by
a
great
multitude
even
all
the
people
that
dwelt
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
pathros
answered
jeremiah
saying
as
for
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
we
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
but
we
will
certainly
do
whatsoever
thing
goeth
forth
out
of
our
own
mouth
to
burn
incense
unto
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
as
we
have
done
we
and
our
fathers
our
kings
and
our
princes
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
for
then
had
we
plenty
of
victuals
and
were
well
and
saw
no
evil
but
since
we
left
off
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
we
have
wanted
all
things
and
have
been
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
when
we
burned
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
did
we
make
her
cakes
to
worship
her
and
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
without
our
men
then
jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
to
the
men
and
to
the
women
and
to
all
the
people
which
had
given
him
that
answer
saying
the
incense
that
ye
burned
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
ye
and
your
fathers
your
kings
and
your
princes
and
the
people
of
the
land
did
not
the
lord
remember
them
and
came
it
not
into
his
mind
so
that
the
lord
could
no
longer
bear
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
and
because
of
the
abominations
which
ye
have
committed
therefore
is
your
land
a
desolation
and
an
astonishment
and
a
curse
without
an
inhabitant
as
at
this
day
because
ye
have
burned
incense
and
because
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
nor
walked
in
his
law
nor
in
his
statutes
nor
in
his
testimonies
therefore
this
evil
is
happened
unto
you
as
at
this
day
moreover
jeremiah
said
unto
all
the
people
and
to
all
the
women
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
all
judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
egypt
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saying
ye
and
your
wives
have
both
spoken
with
your
mouths
and
fulfilled
with
your
hand
saying
we
will
surely
perform
our
vows
that
we
have
vowed
to
burn
incense
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
her
ye
will
surely
accomplish
your
vows
and
surely
perform
your
vows
therefore
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
all
judah
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
egypt
behold
i
have
sworn
by
my
great
name
saith
the
lord
that
my
name
shall
no
more
be
named
in
the
mouth
of
any
man
of
judah
in
all
the
land
of
egypt
saying
the
lord
god
liveth
behold
i
will
watch
over
them
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
all
the
men
of
judah
that
are
in
the
land
of
egypt
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
until
there
be
an
end
of
them
yet
a
small
number
that
escape
the
sword
shall
return
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
into
the
land
of
judah
and
all
the
remnant
of
judah
that
are
gone
into
the
land
of
egypt
to
sojourn
there
shall
know
whose
words
shall
stand
mine
or
their's
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
punish
you
in
this
place
that
ye
may
know
that
my
words
shall
surely
stand
against
you
for
evil
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
pharaohhophra
king
of
egypt
into
the
hand
of
his
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
them
that
seek
his
life
as
i
gave
zedekiah
king
of
judah
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
his
enemy
and
that
sought
his
life
the
word
that
jeremiah
the
prophet
spake
unto
baruch
the
son
of
neriah
when
he
had
written
these
words
in
a
book
at
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
unto
thee
o
baruch
thou
didst
say
woe
is
me
now
for
the
lord
hath
added
grief
to
my
sorrow
i
fainted
in
my
sighing
and
i
find
no
rest
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
him
the
lord
saith
thus
behold
that
which
i
have
built
will
i
break
down
and
that
which
i
have
planted
i
will
pluck
up
even
this
whole
land
and
seekest
thou
great
things
for
thyself
seek
them
not
for
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
all
flesh
saith
the
lord
but
thy
life
will
i
give
unto
thee
for
a
prey
in
all
places
whither
thou
goest
the
word
of
the
lord
which
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
against
the
gentiles
against
egypt
against
the
army
of
pharaohnecho
king
of
egypt
which
was
by
the
river
euphrates
in
carchemish
which
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
smote
in
the
fourth
year
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
order
ye
the
buckler
and

horses
and
get
up
ye
horsemen
and
stand
forth
with
your
helmets

spears
and
put
on
the
brigandines
wherefore
have
i
seen
them
dismayed
and
turned
away
back
and
their
mighty
ones
are
beaten
down
and
are
fled
apace
and
look
not
back
for
fear
was
round
about
saith
the
lord
let
not
the
swift
flee
away
nor
the
mighty
man
escape
they
shall
stumble
and
fall
toward
the
north
by
the
river
euphrates
who
is
this
that
cometh
up
as
a
flood
whose
waters
are
moved
as
the
rivers
egypt
riseth
up
like
a
flood
and
his
waters
are
moved
like
the
rivers
and
he
saith
i
will
go
up
and
will
cover
the
earth
i
will
destroy
the
city
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
come
up
ye
horses
and
rage
ye
chariots
and
let
the
mighty
men
come
forth
the
ethiopians
and
the
libyans
that
handle
the
shield
and
the
lydians
that
handle
and
bend
the
bow
for
this
is
the
day
of
the
lord
god
of
hosts
a
day
of
vengeance
that
he
may
avenge
him
of
his
adversaries
and
the
sword
shall
devour
and
it
shall
be
satiate
and
made
drunk
with
their
blood
for
the
lord

go
up
into
gilead
and
take
balm
o
virgin
the
daughter
of
egypt
in
vain
shalt
thou
use
many
medicines
for
thou
shalt
not
be
cured
the
nations
have
heard
of
thy
shame
and
thy
cry
hath
filled
the
land
for
the
mighty
man
hath
stumbled
against
the
mighty
and
they
are
fallen
both
together
the
word
that
the
lord
spake
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
how
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
should
come
and
smite
the
land
of
egypt
declare
ye
in
egypt
and
publish
in
migdol
and
publish
in
noph
and
in
tahpanhes
say
ye
stand
fast
and
prepare
thee
for
the
sword
shall
devour
round
about
thee
why
are
thy
valiant
men
swept
away
they
stood
not
because
the
lord
did
drive
them
he
made
many
to
fall
yea
one
fell
upon
another
and
they
said
arise
and
let
us
go
again
to
our
own
people
and
to
the
land
of
our
nativity
from
the
oppressing
sword
they
did
cry
there
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
is
but
a
noise
he
hath
passed
the
time
appointed
as
i
live
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
surely
as
tabor
is
among
the
mountains
and
as
carmel
by
the
sea
so
shall
he
come
o
thou
daughter
dwelling
in
egypt
furnish
thyself
to
go
into
captivity
for
noph
shall
be
waste
and
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
egypt
is
like
a
very
fair
heifer
but
destruction
cometh
it
cometh
out
of
the
north
also
her
hired
men
are
in
the
midst
of
her
like
fatted
bullocks
for
they
also
are
turned
back
and
are
fled
away
together
they
did
not
stand
because
the
day
of
their
calamity
was
come
upon
them
and
the
time
of
their
visitation
the
voice
thereof
shall
go
like
a
serpent
for
they
shall
march
with
an
army
and
come
against
her
with
axes
as
hewers
of
wood
they
shall
cut
down
her
forest
saith
the
lord
though
it
cannot
be
searched
because
they
are
more
than
the
grasshoppers
and
are
innumerable
the
daughter
of
egypt
shall
be
confounded
she
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
north
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
saith
behold
i
will
punish
the
multitude
of
no
and
pharaoh
and
egypt
with
their
gods
and
their
kings
even
pharaoh
and
all
them
that
trust
in
him
and
i
will
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
those
that
seek
their
lives
and
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
afterward
it
shall
be
inhabited
as
in
the
days
of
old
saith
the
lord
but
fear
not
thou
o
my
servant
jacob
and
be
not
dismayed
o
israel
for
behold
i
will
save
thee
from
afar
off
and
thy
seed
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
and
jacob
shall
return
and
be
in
rest
and
at
ease
and
none
shall
make
him
afraid
fear
thou
not
o
jacob
my
servant
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
with
thee
for
i
will
make
a
full
end
of
all
the
nations
whither
i
have
driven
thee
but
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
of
thee
but
correct
thee
in
measure
yet
will
i
not
leave
thee
wholly
unpunished
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
against
the
philistines
before
that
pharaoh
smote
gaza
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
waters
rise
up
out
of
the
north
and
shall
be
an
overflowing
flood
and
shall
overflow
the
land
and
all
that
is
therein
the
city
and
them
that
dwell
therein
then
the
men
shall
cry
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
howl
at
the
noise
of
the
stamping
of
the
hoofs
of
his
strong
horses
at
the
rushing
of
his
chariots
and
at
the
rumbling
of
his
wheels
the
fathers
shall
not
look
back
to
their
children
for
feebleness
of
hands
because
of
the
day
that
cometh
to
spoil
all
the
philistines
and
to
cut
off
from
tyrus
and
zidon
every
helper

the
country
of

thou
cut

sword
of

how
long
will
it
be
ere
thou
be
quiet
put
up
thyself
into
thy
scabbard
rest
and
be
still
how
can
it
be
quiet
seeing
the
lord
hath
given
it
a
charge
against
ashkelon
and
against
the
sea
shore
there
hath
he
appointed
it
against
moab
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
woe
unto
nebo
for
it
is
spoiled
kiriathaim
is
confounded
and
taken
misgab
is
confounded
and
dismayed
there
shall
be
no
more
praise
of
moab
in
heshbon
they
have
devised
evil
against
it
come
and
let
us
cut
it
off
from
being
a
nation
also
thou
shalt
be
cut
down
o
madmen
the
sword
shall
pursue
thee
a
voice
of
crying
shall
be
from
horonaim
spoiling
and
great
destruction
moab
is
destroyed
her
little
ones
have
caused
a
cry
to
be
heard
for
in
the
going
up
of
luhith
continual
weeping
shall
go
up
for
in
the
going
down
of
horonaim
the
enemies
have
heard
a
cry
of
destruction
flee
save
your
lives
and
be
like
the
heath
in
the
wilderness
for
because
thou
hast
trusted
in
thy
works
and
in
thy
treasures
thou
shalt
also
be
taken
and
chemosh
shall
go
forth
into
captivity
with
his
priests
and
his
princes
together
and
the
spoiler
shall
come
upon
every
city
and
no
city
shall
escape
the
valley
also
shall
perish
and
the
plain
shall
be
destroyed
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
give
wings
unto
moab
that
it
may
flee
and
get
away
for
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
desolate
without
any
to
dwell
therein
cursed
be
he
that
doeth
the
work
of
the
lord
deceitfully
and
cursed
be
he
that
keepeth
back
his
sword
from
blood
moab
hath
been
at
ease
from
his
youth
and
he
hath
settled
on
his
lees
and
hath
not
been
emptied
from
vessel
to
vessel
neither
hath
he
gone
into
captivity
therefore
his
taste
remained
in
him
and
his
scent
is
not
changed
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
send
unto
him
wanderers
that
shall
cause
him
to
wander
and
shall
empty
his
vessels
and
break
their
bottles
and
moab
shall
be
ashamed
of
chemosh
as
the
house
of
israel
was
ashamed
of
bethel
their
confidence
how
say
ye
we
are
mighty
and
strong
men
for
the
war
moab
is
spoiled
and
gone
up
out
of
her
cities
and
his
chosen
young
men
are
gone
down
to
the
slaughter
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
the
calamity
of
moab
is
near
to
come
and
his
affliction
hasteth
fast
all
ye
that
are
about
him
bemoan
him
and
all
ye
that
know
his
name
say
how
is
the
strong
staff
broken
and
the
beautiful
rod
thou
daughter
that
dost
inhabit
dibon
come
down
from
thy
glory
and
sit
in
thirst
for
the
spoiler
of
moab
shall
come
upon
thee
and
he
shall
destroy
thy
strong
holds
o
inhabitant
of
aroer
stand
by
the
way
and
espy
ask
him
that
fleeth
and
her
that
escapeth
and
say
what
is
done
moab
is
confounded
for
it
is
broken
down
howl
and
cry
tell
ye
it
in
arnon
that
moab
is
spoiled
and
judgment
is
come
upon
the
plain
country
upon
holon
and
upon
jahazah
and
upon
mephaath
and
upon
dibon
and
upon
nebo
and
upon
bethdiblathaim
and
upon
kiriathaim
and
upon
bethgamul
and
upon
bethmeon
and
upon
kerioth
and
upon
bozrah
and
upon
all
the
cities
of
the
land
of
moab
far
or
near
the
horn
of
moab
is
cut
off
and
his
arm
is
broken
saith
the
lord
make
ye
him
drunken
for
he
magnified
himself
against
the
lord
moab
also
shall
wallow
in
his
vomit
and
he
also
shall
be
in
derision
for
was
not
israel
a
derision
unto
thee
was
he
found
among
thieves
for
since
thou
spakest
of
him
thou
skippedst
for
joy
o
ye
that
dwell
in
moab
leave
the
cities
and
dwell
in
the
rock
and
be
like
the
dove
that
maketh
her
nest
in
the
sides
of
the
hole's
mouth
we
have
heard
the
pride
of
moab
he
is
exceeding
proud
his
loftiness
and
his
arrogancy
and
his
pride
and
the
haughtiness
of
his
heart
i
know
his
wrath
saith
the
lord
but
it
shall
not
be
so
his
lies
shall
not
so
effect
it
therefore
will
i
howl
for
moab
and
i
will
cry
out
for
all
moab
mine
heart
shall
mourn
for
the
men
of
kirheres
o
vine
of
sibmah
i
will
weep
for
thee
with
the
weeping
of
jazer
thy
plants
are
gone
over
the
sea
they
reach
even
to
the
sea
of
jazer
the
spoiler
is
fallen
upon
thy
summer
fruits
and
upon
thy
vintage
and
joy
and
gladness
is
taken
from
the
plentiful
field
and
from
the
land
of
moab
and
i
have
caused
wine
to
fail
from
the
winepresses
none
shall
tread
with
shouting
their
shouting
shall
be
no
shouting
from
the
cry
of
heshbon
even
unto
elealeh
and
even
unto
jahaz
have
they
uttered
their
voice
from
zoar
even
unto
horonaim
as
an
heifer
of
three
years
old
for
the
waters
also
of
nimrim
shall
be
desolate
moreover
i
will
cause
to
cease
in
moab
saith
the
lord
him
that
offereth
in
the
high
places
and
him
that
burneth
incense
to
his
gods
therefore
mine
heart
shall
sound
for
moab
like
pipes
and
mine
heart
shall
sound
like
pipes
for
the
men
of
kirheres
because
the
riches
that
he
hath
gotten
are
perished
for
every
head
shall
be
bald
and
every
beard
clipped
upon
all
the
hands
shall
be
cuttings
and
upon
the
loins
sackcloth
there
shall
be
lamentation
generally
upon
all
the
housetops
of
moab
and
in
the
streets
thereof
for
i
have
broken
moab
like
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
saith
the
lord
they
shall
howl
saying
how
is
it
broken
down
how
hath
moab
turned
the
back
with
shame
so
shall
moab
be
a
derision
and
a
dismaying
to
all
them
about
him
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
he
shall
fly
as
an
eagle
and
shall
spread
his
wings
over
moab
kerioth
is
taken
and
the
strong
holds
are
surprised
and
the
mighty
men's
hearts
in
moab
at
that
day
shall
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs
and
moab
shall
be
destroyed
from
being
a
people
because
he
hath
magnified
himself
against
the
lord
fear
and
the
pit
and
the
snare
shall
be
upon
thee
o
inhabitant
of
moab
saith
the
lord
he
that
fleeth
from
the
fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit
and
he
that
getteth
up
out
of
the
pit
shall
be
taken
in
the
snare
for
i
will
bring
upon
it
even
upon
moab
the
year
of
their
visitation
saith
the
lord
they
that
fled
stood
under
the
shadow
of
heshbon
because
of
the
force
but
a
fire
shall
come
forth
out
of
heshbon
and
a
flame
from
the
midst
of
sihon
and
shall
devour
the
corner
of
moab
and
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
tumultuous
ones
woe
be
unto
thee
o
moab
the
people
of
chemosh
perisheth
for
thy
sons
are
taken
captives
and
thy
daughters
captives
yet
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
moab
in
the
latter
days
saith
the
lord
thus
far
is
the
judgment
of
moab
concerning
the
ammonites
thus
saith
the
lord
hath
israel
no
sons
hath
he
no
heir
why
then
doth
their
king
inherit
gad
and
his
people
dwell
in
his
cities
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
cause
an
alarm
of
war
to
be
heard
in
rabbah
of
the
ammonites
and
it
shall
be
a
desolate
heap
and
her
daughters
shall
be
burned
with
fire
then
shall
israel
be
heir
unto
them
that
were
his
heirs
saith
the
lord
howl
o
heshbon
for
ai
is
spoiled
cry
ye
daughters
of
rabbah
gird
you
with
sackcloth
lament
and
run
to
and
fro
by
the
hedges
for
their
king
shall
go
into
captivity
and
his
priests
and
his
princes
together
wherefore
gloriest
thou
in
the
valleys
thy
flowing
valley
o
backsliding
daughter
that
trusted
in
her
treasures
saying
who
shall
come
unto
me
behold
i
will
bring
a
fear
upon
thee
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
from
all
those
that
be
about
thee
and
ye
shall
be
driven
out
every
man
right
forth
and
none
shall
gather
up
him
that
wandereth
and
afterward
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
the
children
of
ammon
saith
the
lord
concerning
edom
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
is
wisdom
no
more
in
teman
is
counsel
perished
from
the
prudent
is
their
wisdom
vanished
flee
ye
turn
back
dwell
deep
o
inhabitants
of
dedan
for
i
will
bring
the
calamity
of
esau
upon
him
the
time
that
i
will
visit
him
if
grapegatherers
come
to
thee
would
they
not
leave
some
gleaning
grapes
if
thieves
by
night
they
will
destroy
till
they
have
enough
but
i
have
made
esau
bare
i
have
uncovered
his
secret
places
and
he
shall
not
be
able
to
hide
himself
his
seed
is
spoiled
and
his
brethren
and
his
neighbours
and
he
is
not
leave
thy
fatherless
children
i
will
preserve
them
alive
and
let
thy
widows
trust
in
me
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
they
whose
judgment
was
not
to
drink
of
the
cup
have
assuredly
drunken
and
art
thou
he
that
shall
altogether
go
unpunished
thou
shalt
not
go
unpunished
but
thou
shalt
surely
drink
of
it
for
i
have
sworn
by
myself
saith
the
lord
that
bozrah
shall
become
a
desolation
a
reproach
a
waste
and
a
curse
and
all
the
cities
thereof
shall
be
perpetual
wastes
i
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
lord
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
unto
the
heathen
saying
gather
ye
together
and
come
against
her
and
rise
up
to
the
battle
for
lo
i
will
make
thee
small
among
the
heathen
and
despised
among
men
thy
terribleness
hath
deceived
thee
and
the
pride
of
thine
heart
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
that
holdest
the
height
of
the
hill
though
thou
shouldest
make
thy
nest
as
high
as
the
eagle
i
will
bring
thee
down
from
thence
saith
the
lord
also
edom
shall
be
a
desolation
every
one
that
goeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished
and
shall
hiss
at
all
the
plagues
thereof
as
in
the
overthrow
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof
saith
the
lord
no
man
shall
abide
there
neither
shall
a
son
of
man
dwell
in
it
behold
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
jordan
against
the
habitation
of
the
strong
but
i
will
suddenly
make
him
run
away
from
her
and
who
is
a
chosen
man
that
i
may
appoint
over
her
for
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me
therefore
hear
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
he
hath
taken
against
edom
and
his
purposes
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
inhabitants
of
teman
surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitations
desolate
with
them
the
earth
is
moved
at
the
noise
of
their
fall
at
the
cry
the
noise
thereof
was
heard
in
the
red
sea
behold
he
shall
come
up
and
fly
as
the
eagle
and
spread
his
wings
over
bozrah
and
at
that
day
shall
the
heart
of
the
mighty
men
of
edom
be
as
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
her
pangs
concerning
damascus
hamath
is
confounded
and
arpad
for
they
have
heard
evil
tidings
they
are
fainthearted
there
is
sorrow
on
the
sea
it
cannot
be
quiet
damascus
is
waxed
feeble
and
turneth
herself
to
flee
and
fear
hath
seized
on
her
anguish
and
sorrows
have
taken
her
as
a
woman
in
travail
how
is
the
city
of
praise
not
left
the
city
of
my
joy
therefore
her
young
men
shall
fall
in
her
streets
and
all
the
men
of
war
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
the
wall
of
damascus
and
it
shall
consume
the
palaces
of
benhadad
concerning
kedar
and
concerning
the
kingdoms
of
hazor
which
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
shall
smite
thus
saith
the
lord
arise
ye
go
up
to
kedar
and
spoil
the
men
of
the
east
their
tents
and
their
flocks

the
lord
which

and
their
camels

be
a
booty
and
the
multitude

corners
and
i
will
bring
their
calamity
from

a
desolation
for

no
man
abide
there
nor

the
word
of
the
lord
that

to
jeremiah
the
prophet
against
elam
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i

the
chief
of

might
and
upon

i
bring
the
four
winds
from

four
quarters
of

scatter
them
toward
all
those
winds
and
there
shall
be
no
nation
whither
the
outcasts
of
elam
shall
not
come
for
i
will
cause
elam
to
be
dismayed
before
their
enemies
and
before
them
that
seek
their
life
and
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
even
my
fierce
anger
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
send
the
sword
after
them
till
i
have
consumed
them
and
i
will
set
my
throne
in
elam
and
will
destroy
from
thence
the
king
and
the
princes
saith
the
lord
but
it
shall
come
to

of
the
wrath
of
the

and
thou

hath
been
proud
against

therefore
shall
her
young
men
fall
in
the
streets
and
all
her
men
of

shall
be
cut
off
in
that
day
saith
the

behold
i
am
against
thee
o
thou
most
proud
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
thy
day
is
come
the
time
that
i
will
visit
thee
and
the
most
proud
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
none
shall
raise
him
up
and
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
his
cities
and
it
shall
devour
all
round
about
him
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
judah
were
oppressed
together
and
all
that
took
them
captives
held
them
fast
they
refused
to
let
them
go
their
redeemer
is
strong
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
he
shall
throughly
plead
their
cause
that
he
may
give
rest
to
the
land
and
disquiet
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
a
sword
is
upon
the
chaldeans
saith
the
lord
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
and
upon
her
princes
and
upon
her
wise
men
a
sword
is
upon
the
liars
and
they
shall
dote
a
sword
is
upon
her
mighty
men
and
they
shall
be
dismayed
a
sword
is
upon
their
horses
and
upon
their
chariots
and
upon
all
the
mingled
people
that
are
in
the
midst
of
her
and
they
shall
become
as
women
a
sword
is
upon
her
treasures
and
they
shall
be
robbed
a
drought
is
upon
her
waters
and
they
shall
be
dried
up
for
it
is
the
land
of
graven
images
and
they
are
mad
upon
their
idols
therefore
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
dwell
there
and
the
owls
shall
dwell
therein
and

shall
be
no
more
inhabited
for
ever
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
as
god
overthrew
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
the
neighbour
cities
thereof
saith
the
lord
so
shall
no
man
abide
there
neither
shall
any
son
of
man
dwell
therein
behold
a
people
shall
come
from
the
north
and
a
great
nation
and
many
kings
shall
be
raised
up
from
the
coasts
of
the
earth
they
shall
hold
the
bow
and
the
lance
they
are
cruel
and
will
not
shew
mercy
their
voice
shall
roar
like
the
sea
and
they
shall
ride
upon
horses
every
one
put
in
array
like
a
man
to
the
battle
against
thee
o
daughter
of
babylon
the
king
of
babylon
hath
heard
the
report
of
them
and
his
hands
waxed
feeble
anguish
took
hold
of
him
and
pangs
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
behold
he
shall
come
up
like
a
lion
from
the
swelling
of
jordan
unto
the
habitation
of
the
strong
but
i
will
make
them
suddenly
run
away
from
her
and
who
is
a
chosen
man
that
i
may
appoint
over
her
for
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
appoint
me
the
time
and
who
is
that
shepherd
that
will
stand
before
me
therefore
hear
ye
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
he
hath
taken
against
babylon
and
his
purposes
that
he
hath
purposed
against
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
surely
the
least
of
the
flock
shall
draw
them
out
surely
he
shall
make
their
habitation
desolate
with
them
at
the
noise
of
the
taking
of
babylon
the
earth
is
moved
and
the
cry
is
heard
among
the
nations
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
raise
up
against
babylon
and
against
them
that
dwell
in
the
midst
of
them
that
rise
up
against
me
a
destroying
wind
and
will
send
unto
babylon
fanners
that
shall
fan
her
and
shall
empty
her
land
for
in
the
day
of
trouble
they
shall
be
against
her
round
about
against
him
that
bendeth
let
the
archer
bend
his
bow
and
against
him
that
lifteth
himself
up
in
his
brigandine
and
spare
ye
not
her
young
men
destroy
ye
utterly
all
her
host
thus
the
slain
shall
fall
in
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
and
they
that
are
thrust
through
in
her
streets
for
israel
hath
not
been
forsaken
nor
judah
of
his
god
of
the

though
their

was
filled
with

her
iniquity
for
this
is
the
time
of
the
lord's
vengeance

will
render
unto
her
a
recompence
babylon
hath
been
a
golden
cup
in
the
lord's
hand
that
made
all
the
earth
drunken
the
nations
have
drunken
of
her
wine
therefore
the
nations
are
mad
babylon
is
suddenly
fallen
and
destroyed
howl
for
her
take
balm
for
her
pain
if
so
be
she
may
be
healed
we
would
have
healed
babylon
but
she
is
not
healed
forsake
her
and
let
us
go
every
one
into
his
own
country
for
her
judgment
reacheth
unto

spake
against
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
o
thou
that
dwellest
upon
many
waters
abundant
in
treasures
thine
end
is
come
and
the
measure
of
thy
covetousness
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
sworn
by
himself
saying
surely
i
will
fill
thee
with
men
as
with
caterpillers
and
they
shall
lift
up
a
shout
against
thee
he
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heaven
by
his
understanding
when
he
uttereth
his
voice

a
multitude
of
waters
in

he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain
and
bringeth
forth
the

of
his
treasures
every
man
is
brutish
by
his
knowledge
every
founder

vanity
the

errors
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they

therefore
thus

house
wherefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
do
judgment
upon
her
graven
images
and
through
all
her
land
the
wounded
shall
groan
though
babylon
should
mount
up
to
heaven
and
though
she
should
fortify
the
height
of
her
strength
yet
from
me
shall
spoilers
come
unto
her
saith
the
lord
a
sound
of
a
cry
cometh
from
babylon
and
great
destruction
from
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
because
the
lord
hath
spoiled
babylon
and
destroyed
out
of
her
the
great
voice
when
her
waves
do
roar
like
great
waters
a
noise
of
their
voice
is
uttered
because
the
spoiler
is
come
upon
her
even
upon
babylon
and
her
mighty
men
are
taken
every
one
of
their
bows
is
broken
for
the
lord
god
of
recompences
shall
surely
requite
and
i
will
make
drunk
her
princes
and
her
wise
men
her
captains
and
her
rulers
and
her
mighty
men
and
they
shall
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep
and
not
wake
saith
the
king
whose
name
is
the
lord
of
hosts
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
broad
walls
of
babylon
shall
be
utterly
broken
and
her
high
gates
shall
be
burned
with
fire
and
the
people
shall
labour
in
vain
and
the
folk
in
the
fire
and
they
shall
be
weary
the
word
which
jeremiah
the
prophet
commanded
seraiah
the
son
of
neriah
the
son
of
maaseiah
when
he
went
with
zedekiah
the
king
of
judah
into
babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
and
this
seraiah
was
a
quiet
prince
so
jeremiah
wrote
in
a
book
all
the
evil
that
should
come
upon
babylon
even
all
these
words
that
are
written
against
babylon
and
jeremiah
said
to
seraiah
when
thou
comest
to
babylon
and
shalt
see
and
shalt
read
all
these
words
then
shalt
thou
say
o
lord
thou
hast
spoken
against
this
place
to
cut
it
off
that
none
shall
remain
in
it
neither
man
nor
beast
but
that
it
shall
be
desolate
for
ever
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
reading
this
book
that
thou
shalt
bind
a
stone
to
it
and
cast
it
into
the
midst
of
euphrates
and
thou
shalt
say
thus
shall
babylon
sink
and
shall
not
rise
from
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
her
and
they
shall
be
weary
thus
far
are
the
words
of
jeremiah
zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eleven
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
hamutal
the
daughter
of
jeremiah
of
libnah
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
jehoiakim
had
done
for
through
the
anger
of
the
lord
it
came
to
pass
in
jerusalem
and
judah
till
he
had
cast
them
out
from
his
presence
that
zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of
babylon
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninth
year
of
his
reign
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
that
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
came
he
and
all
his
army
against
jerusalem
and
pitched
against
it
and
built
forts
against
it
round
about
so
the
city
was
besieged
unto
the
eleventh
year
of
king
zedekiah
and
in
the
fourth
month
in
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
famine
was
sore
in
the
city
so
that
there
was
no
bread
for
the
people
of
the
land
then
the
city
was
broken
up
and
all
the
men
of
war
fled
and
went
forth
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
the
way
of
the
gate
between
the
two
walls
which
was
by
the
king's
garden
now
the
chaldeans
were
by
the
city
round
about
and
they
went
by
the
way
of
the
plain
but
the
army
of
the
chaldeans
pursued
after
the
king
and
overtook
zedekiah
in
the
plains
of
jericho
and
all
his
army
was
scattered
from
him
then
they
took
the
king
and
carried
him
up
unto
the
king
of
babylon
to
riblah
in
the
land
of
hamath
where
he
gave
judgment
upon
him
and
the
king
of
babylon
slew
the
sons
of
zedekiah
before
his
eyes
he
slew
also
all
the
princes
of
judah
in
riblah
then
he
put
out
the
eyes
of
zedekiah
and
the
king
of
babylon
bound
him
in
chains
and
carried
him
to
babylon
and
put
him
in
prison
till
the
day
of
his
death
now
in
the
fifth
month
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
which
was
the
nineteenth
year
of
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
came
nebuzaradan

of
the

which
served
the

then
nebuzaradan
the

and
the
residue
of
the

that
remained
in
the
city
and
those
that
fell
away
that
fell
to
the
king
of
babylon
and
the
rest
of
the
multitude
but
nebuzaradan
the
captain
of
the

left
certain
of
the

and
the

that
which
was
of

and
that
which
was
of

took
the

of
the

away
the
two

and
twelve
brasen
bulls
that
were
under
the
bases
which
king
solomon
had
made
in
the
house
of
the
lord
the
brass
of
all
these
vessels
was
without
weight
and
concerning
the
pillars
the
height
of
one
pillar
was
eighteen
cubits
and
a
fillet
of
twelve
cubits
did
compass
it
and
the
thickness
thereof
was
four
fingers
it
was
hollow
and
a
chapiter
of
brass
was
upon
it
and

upon
the

round
about
all
of

the

also
and
the

and
there
were
ninety

six
pomegranates
on
a
side
and
all
the

and
set
his
throne
above
the
throne
of
the
kings
that
were
with
him
in
babylon
and
changed
his
prison
garments
and
he
did
continually
eat
bread
before

all
the

and
for

there
was
a
continual
diet
given

of
the
king
of

every

a
portion
until
the
day
of
his
death
all
the
days
of

the
lamentations
of
jeremiah
how
doth
the
city
sit
solitary
that

nations
and

she
hath
none
to
comfort
her
all
her
friends
have
dealt
treacherously
with
her
they
are
become
her
enemies
judah
is
gone
into
captivity
because
of
affliction
and
because
of
great
servitude
she
dwelleth
among
the
heathen
she
findeth
no
rest
all
her
persecutors
overtook
her
between

princes
are
become
like
harts
that
find
no
pasture

they
are
gone
without
strength
before
the
pursuer
jerusalem
remembered
in
the
days
of
her
affliction
and
of
her
miseries
all
her
pleasant
things
that
she
had
in

fell
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
none
did
help
her
the
adversaries
saw
her
and
did
mock
at
her
sabbaths
jerusalem
hath
grievously
sinned
therefore
she
is

she
sigheth
and
turneth
backward

in
her
skirts

my
affliction
for
the
enemy
hath
magnified
himself
the
adversary
hath
spread
out
his
hand
upon

she
hath
seen
that
the
heathen
entered
into
her
sanctuary
whom
thou
didst
command
that
they
should
not
enter
into
thy
congregation
all
her
people

hast
done
unto
me
for

my
transgressions
for
my
sighs

many
and
my
heart
is
faint
how
hath
the
lord
covered
the
daughter
of
zion
with
a
cloud
in
his
anger
and
cast
down
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
the
beauty
of

day
of
his
anger
the

hath
brought
them
down
to
the
ground
he
hath
polluted
the
kingdom
and
the
princes
thereof
he
hath
cut
off
in
his
fierce
anger
all
the
horn
of
israel
he
hath
drawn
back
his
right
hand
from
before
the
enemy
and
he
burned
against
jacob
like
a
flaming
fire
which
devoureth
round
about
he
hath
bent
his
bow
like
an
enemy
he
stood
with
his
right
hand
as
an
adversary
and
slew
all
that
were
pleasant
to
the
eye
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
daughter
of
zion
he
poured
out
his
fury
like

as
an
enemy
he
hath
swallowed
up
israel
he
hath
swallowed
up
all
her
palaces
he
hath
destroyed
his
strong
holds
and
hath
increased
in
the
daughter
of
judah
mourning
and
lamentation
and
he
hath
violently
taken
away
his
tabernacle
as
if
it
were
of
a
garden
he
hath
destroyed
his
places
of
the
assembly
the
lord
hath
caused
the
solemn
feasts

forgotten
in
zion
and
hath
despised
in
the
indignation
of
his
anger
the
king
and
the
priest
the
lord
hath
cast
off
his
altar
he
hath
abhorred
his
sanctuary
he
hath
given
up
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
the
walls
of
her
palaces
they
have
made
a
noise
in
the
house
of
the
lord
as
in
the
day
of
a
solemn
feast
the
lord
hath
purposed
to
destroy
the
wall
of
the
daughter
of
zion
he
hath
stretched
out
a
line
he
hath
not
withdrawn
his
hand
from
destroying
therefore
he
made
the
rampart
and
the
wall
to
lament
they
languished
together
her
gates
are
sunk
into
the
ground
he
hath
destroyed
and
broken
her
bars

king
and
her
princes
are
among
the
gentiles
the
law

no
more
her
prophets

no
vision
from
the
lord
the
elders
of
the
daughter
of
zion

upon
the
ground
and
keep
silence
they
have
cast
up
dust
upon
their
heads
they
have
girded
themselves
with
sackcloth
the
virgins
of
jerusalem
hang
down
their
heads
to
the
ground
mine
eyes
do
fail
with
tears
my
bowels
are
troubled
my
liver
is
poured
upon
the
earth
for
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
because
the
children
and
the
sucklings
swoon
in
the
streets
of
the
city
they
say
to
their
mothers
where
is
corn
and
wine
when
they
swooned
as
the
wounded
in
the
streets
of
the
city
when
their
soul
was
poured
out
into
their
mothers
bosom
what
thing
shall
i
take
to
witness
for
thee
what
thing
shall
i
liken
to
thee
o
daughter
of
jerusalem
what
shall
i
equal
to
thee
that
i
may
comfort
thee
o
virgin
daughter
of
zion
for
thy
breach
is
great
like
the
sea
who
can
heal
thee
thy
prophets
have
seen
vain
and
foolish
things
for
thee
and
they
have
not
discovered
thine
iniquity
to
turn
away
thy
captivity
but
have
seen
for
thee
false
burdens
and
causes
of
banishment
all
that
pass
by
clap
their
hands
at
thee
they
hiss
and
wag
their
head
at
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
saying
is
this
the
city
that
men
call
the
perfection
of
beauty
the
joy
of
the
whole
earth
all
thine
enemies
have
opened
their
mouth
against
thee
they
hiss
and
gnash
the
teeth
they
say
we
have
swallowed
her
up
certainly
this
is
the
day
that
we
looked
for
we
have
found
we
have
seen
it
the
lord
hath
done
that
which
he
had
devised
he
hath
fulfilled
his
word
that
he
had
commanded
in
the
days
of
old
he
hath
thrown
down
and
hath
not
pitied
and
he
hath
caused
thine
enemy
to
rejoice
over
thee
he
hath
set
up
the
horn
of
thine
adversaries
their
heart
cried
unto
the
lord
o
wall
of
the
daughter
of
zion
let
tears
run
down
like
a
river
day
and
night
give
thyself
no
rest
let
not
the
apple
of
thine
eye
cease
arise
cry
out
in
the
night
in
the
beginning
of
the
watches
pour
out
thine
heart
like
water
before
the
face
of
the
lord
lift
up
thy
hands
toward
him
for
the
life
of
thy
young
children
that
faint
for
hunger
in
the
top
of
every
street
behold
o
lord
and
consider
to
whom
thou
hast
done
this
shall
the
women
eat
their
fruit
and
children
of
a
span
long
shall
the
priest
and
the
prophet
be
slain
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
the
young
and
the
old
lie
on
the
ground
in
the
streets
my
virgins
and
my
young
men
are
fallen
by
the
sword
thou
hast
slain
them
in
the
day
of
thine
anger
thou
hast
killed
and
not
pitied
thou
hast
called
as
in
a
solemn
day
my
terrors
round
about
so
that
in
the
day
of
the
lord's
anger
none
escaped
nor
remained
those
that
i
have
swaddled
and
brought
up
hath
mine
enemy
consumed
i
am
the
man
that
hath
seen
affliction
by
the
rod
of
his
wrath
he
hath
led
me
and
brought
me
into
darkness
but
not
into
light
surely
against
me
is
he
turned
he
turneth
his
hand
against
me
all
the
day
my
flesh
and
my
skin
hath
he
made
old
he
hath
broken
my
bones
he
hath
builded
against
me
and
compassed
me
with
gall
and
travail
he
hath
set
me
in
dark
places
as
they
that
be
dead
of
old
he
hath
hedged
me
about
that
i
cannot
get
out
he
hath
made
my
chain
heavy
also
when
i
cry
and
shout
he
shutteth
out
my
prayer
he
hath
inclosed
my
ways
with
hewn
stone
he
hath
made
my
paths
crooked
he
was
unto
me
as
a
bear
lying
in
wait
and
as
a
lion
in
secret
places
he
hath
turned
aside
my
ways
and
pulled
me
in
pieces
he
hath
made
me
desolate
he
hath
bent
his
bow
and
set
me
as
a
mark
for
the
arrow
he
hath
caused
the
arrows
of
his
quiver
to
enter
into
my
reins
i
was
a
derision
to
all
my
people
and
their
song
all
the
day
he
hath
filled
me
with
bitterness
he
hath
made
me
drunken
with
wormwood
he
hath
also
broken
my
teeth
with
gravel
stones
he
hath
covered
me
with
ashes
and
thou
hast
removed
my
soul
far
off
from
peace
i
forgat
prosperity
and
i
said
my
strength
and
my
hope
is
perished
from
the
lord
remembering
mine
affliction
and
my
misery
the
wormwood
and
the
gall
my
soul
hath
them
still
in
remembrance
and
is
humbled
in
me
this
i
recall
to
my
mind
therefore
have
i
hope
it
is
of
the
lord's
mercies
that
we
are
not
consumed
because
his
compassions
fail
not
they
are
new
every
morning
great
is
thy
faithfulness
the
lord
is
my
portion
saith
my
soul
therefore
will
i
hope
in
him
the
lord
is
good
unto
them
that
wait
for
him
to
the
soul
that
seeketh
him
it
is
good
that
a
man
should
both
hope
and
quietly
wait
for
the
salvation
of
the
lord
it
is
good
for
a
man
that
he
bear
the
yoke
of
his
youth
he
sitteth
alone
and
keepeth
silence
because
he
hath
borne
it
upon
him
he
putteth
his
mouth
in
the
dust
if
so
be
there
may
be
hope
he
giveth
his
cheek
to
him
that
smiteth
him
he
is
filled
full
with
reproach
for
the
lord
will
not
cast
off
for
ever
but
though
he
cause
grief
yet
will
he
have
compassion
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
mercies
for
he
doth
not
afflict
willingly
nor
grieve
the
children
of
men
to
crush
under
his
feet
all
the
prisoners
of
the
earth
to
turn
aside
the
right
of
a
man
before
the
face
of
the
most
high
to
subvert
a
man
in
his
cause
the
lord
approveth
not
who
is
he
that
saith
and
it
cometh
to
pass
when
the
lord
commandeth
it
not
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
most
high
proceedeth
not
evil
and
good
wherefore
doth
a
living
man
complain
a
man
for
the
punishment
of
his
sins
let
us
search
and
try
our
ways
and
turn
again
to
the
lord
let
us
lift
up
our
heart
with
our
hands
unto
god
in
the
heavens
we
have
transgressed
and
have
rebelled
thou
hast
not
pardoned
thou
hast
covered
with
anger
and
persecuted
us
thou
hast
slain
thou
hast
not
pitied
thou
hast
covered
thyself
with
a
cloud
that
our
prayer
should
not
pass
through
thou
hast
made
us
as
the
offscouring
and
refuse
in
the
midst
of
the
people
all
our
enemies
have
opened
their
mouths
against
us
fear
and
a
snare
is
come
upon
us
desolation
and
destruction
mine
eye
runneth
down
with
rivers
of
water
for
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
mine
eye
trickleth
down
and
ceaseth
not
without
any
intermission
till
the
lord
look
down
and
behold
from
heaven
mine
eye
affecteth
mine
heart
because
of
all
the
daughters
of
my
city
mine
enemies
chased
me
sore
like
a
bird
without
cause
they
have
cut
off
my
life
in
the
dungeon
and
cast
a
stone
upon
me
waters
flowed
over
mine
head
then
i
said
i
am
cut
off
i
called
upon
thy
name
o
lord
out
of
the
low
dungeon
thou
hast
heard
my
voice
hide
not
thine
ear
at
my
breathing
at
my
cry
thou
drewest
near
in
the
day
that
i
called
upon
thee
thou
saidst
fear
not
o
lord
thou
hast
pleaded
the
causes
of
my
soul
thou
hast
redeemed
my
life
o
lord
thou
hast
seen
my
wrong
judge
thou
my
cause
thou
hast
seen
all
their
vengeance
and
all
their
imaginations
against
me
thou
hast
heard
their
reproach
o
lord
and
all
their
imaginations
against
me
the
lips
of
those
that
rose
up
against
me
and
their
device
against
me
all
the
day
behold
their
sitting
down
and
their
rising
up
i
am
their
musick
render
unto
them
a
recompence
o
lord
according
to
the
work
of
their
hands
give
them
sorrow
of
heart
thy
curse
unto
them
persecute
and
destroy
them
in
anger
from
under
the
heavens
of
the
lord
how
is
the
gold
become
dim
how
is
the
most
fine
gold
changed
the
stones
of
the
sanctuary
are
poured
out
in
the
top
of
every
street
the
precious
sons
of
zion
comparable
to
fine
gold
how
are
they
esteemed
as
earthen
pitchers
the
work
of
the
hands
of
the
potter
even
the
sea
monsters
draw
out
the
breast
they
give
suck
to
their
young
ones
the
daughter
of
my
people
is
become
cruel
like
the
ostriches
in
the
wilderness
the
tongue
of
the
sucking
child
cleaveth
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
for
thirst
the
young
children
ask
bread
and
no
man
breaketh
it
unto
them
they
that
did
feed
delicately
are
desolate
in
the
streets
they
that
were
brought
up
in
scarlet
embrace
dunghills
for
the
punishment
of
the
iniquity
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
is
greater
than
the
punishment
of
the
sin
of
sodom
that
was
overthrown
as
in
a
moment
and
no
hands
stayed
on
her
her
nazarites
were
purer
than
snow
they
were
whiter
than
milk
they
were
more
ruddy
in
body
than
rubies
their
polishing
was
of
sapphire
their
visage
is
blacker
than
a
coal
they
are
not
known
in
the
streets
their
skin
cleaveth
to
their
bones
it
is
withered
it
is
become
like
a
stick
they
that
be
slain
with
the
sword
are
better
than
they
that
be
slain
with
hunger
for
these
pine
away
stricken
through
for
want
of
the
fruits
of
the
field
the
hands
of
the
pitiful
women
have
sodden
their
own
children
they
were
their
meat
in
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
the
lord
hath
accomplished
his
fury
he
hath
poured
out
his
fierce
anger
and
hath
kindled
a
fire
in
zion
and
it
hath
devoured
the
foundations
thereof
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
would
not
have
believed
that
the
adversary
and
the
enemy
should
have
entered
into
the
gates
of
jerusalem
for
the
sins
of
her
prophets
and
the
iniquities
of
her
priests
that
have
shed
the
blood
of
the
just
in
the
midst
of
her
they
have
wandered
as
blind
men
in
the
streets
they
have
polluted
themselves
with
blood
so
that
men
could
not
touch
their
garments
they
cried
unto
them
depart
ye
it
is
unclean
depart
depart
touch
not
when
they
fled
away
and
wandered
they
said
among
the
heathen
they
shall
no
more
sojourn
there
the
anger
of
the
lord
hath
divided
them
he
will
no
more
regard
them
they
respected
not
the
persons
of
the
priests
they
favoured
not
the
elders
as
for
us
our
eyes
as
yet
failed
for
our
vain
help
in
our
watching
we
have
watched
for
a
nation
that
could
not
save
us
they
hunt
our
steps
that
we
cannot
go
in
our
streets
our
end
is
near
our
days
are
fulfilled
for
our
end
is
come
our
persecutors
are
swifter
than
the
eagles
of
the
heaven
they
pursued
us
upon
the
mountains
they
laid
wait
for
us
in
the
wilderness
the
breath
of
our
nostrils
the
anointed
of
the
lord
was
taken
in
their
pits
of
whom
we
said
under
his
shadow
we
shall
live
among
the
heathen
rejoice
and
be
glad
o
daughter
of
edom
that
dwellest
in
the
land
of
uz
the
cup
also
shall
pass
through
unto
thee
thou
shalt
be
drunken
and
shalt
make
thyself
naked
the
punishment
of
thine
iniquity
is
accomplished
o
daughter
of
zion
he
will
no
more
carry
thee
away
into
captivity
he
will
visit
thine
iniquity
o
daughter
of
edom
he
will
discover
thy
sins
remember
o
lord
what
is
come
upon
us
consider
and
behold
our
reproach
our
inheritance
is
turned
to
strangers
our
houses
to
aliens
we
are
orphans
and
fatherless
our
mothers
are
as
widows
we
have
drunken
our
water
for
money
our
wood
is
sold
unto
us
our
necks
are
under
persecution
we
labour
and
have
no
rest
we
have
given
the
hand
to
the
egyptians
and
to
the
assyrians
to
be
satisfied
with
bread
our
fathers
have
sinned
and
are
not
and
we
have
borne
their
iniquities
servants
have
ruled
over
us
there
is
none
that
doth
deliver
us
out
of
their
hand
we
gat
our
bread
with
the
peril
of
our
lives
because
of
the
sword
of
the
wilderness
our
skin
was
black
like
an
oven
because
of
the
terrible
famine
they
ravished
the
women
in
zion
and
the
maids
in
the
cities
of
judah
princes
are
hanged
up
by
their
hand
the
faces
of
elders
were
not
honoured
they
took
the
young
men
to
grind
and
the
children
fell
under
the
wood
the
elders
have
ceased
from
the
gate
the
young
men
from
their
musick
the
joy
of
our
heart
is
ceased
our
dance
is
turned
into
mourning
the
crown
is
fallen
from
our
head
woe
unto
us
that
we
have
sinned
for
this
our
heart
is
faint
for
these
things
our
eyes
are
dim
because
of
the
mountain
of
zion
which
is
desolate
the
foxes
walk
upon
it
thou
o
lord
remainest
for
ever
thy
throne
from
generation
to
generation
wherefore
dost
thou
forget
us
for
ever
and
forsake
us
so
long
time
turn
thou
us
unto
thee
o
lord
and
we
shall
be
turned

our
days
as
of
old
but
thou
hast
utterly
rejected
us
thou
art
very
wroth
against
us
the
book
of
the
prophet
ezekiel
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
in
the
fourth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
as
i
was
among
the
captives
by
the
river
of
chebar
that
the
heavens
were
opened
and
i
saw
visions
of
god
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
which
was
the
fifth
year
of
king
jehoiachin's
captivity
the
word
of
the
lord
came
expressly
unto
ezekiel
the
priest
the
son
of
buzi
in
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
by
the
river
chebar
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
there
upon
him
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
whirlwind
came
out
of
the
north
a
great
cloud
and
a
fire
infolding
itself
and
a
brightness
was
about
it
and
out
of
the
midst
thereof
as
the
colour
of
amber
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
also
out
of
the
midst
thereof
came
the
likeness
of
four
living
creatures
and
this
was
their
appearance
they
had
the
likeness
of
a
man
and
every
one
had
four
faces
and
every
one
had
four
wings
and
their
feet
were
straight
feet
and
the
sole
of
their
feet
was
like
the
sole
of
a
calf's
foot
and
they
sparkled
like
the
colour
of
burnished
brass
and
they
had
the
hands
of
a
man
under
their
wings
on
their
four
sides
and
they
four
had
their
faces
and
their
wings
their
wings
were
joined
one
to
another
they
turned
not
when
they
went
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
as
for
the
likeness
of
their
faces
they
four
had
the
face
of
a
man
and
the
face
of
a
lion
on
the
right
side
and
they
four
had
the
face
of
an
ox
on
the
left
side
they
four
also
had
the
face
of
an
eagle
thus
were
their
faces
and
their
wings
were
stretched
upward
two
wings
of
every
one
were
joined
one
to
another
and
two
covered
their
bodies
and
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
whither
the
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went
as
for
the
likeness
of
the
living
creatures
their
appearance
was
like
burning
coals
of
fire
and
like
the
appearance
of
lamps
it
went
up
and
down
among
the
living
creatures
and
the
fire
was
bright
and
out
of
the
fire
went
forth
lightning
and
the
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
as
the
appearance
of
a
flash
of
lightning
now
as
i
beheld
the
living
creatures
behold
one
wheel
upon
the
earth
by
the
living
creatures
with
his
four
faces
the
appearance
of
the
wheels
and
their
work
was
like
unto
the
colour
of
a
beryl
and
they
four
had
one
likeness
and
their
appearance
and
their
work
was
as
it
were
a
wheel
in
the
middle
of
a
wheel
when
they
went
they
went
upon
their
four
sides
and
they
turned
not
when
they
went
as
for
their
rings
they
were
so
high
that
they
were
dreadful
and
their
rings
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
them
four
and
when
the
living
creatures
went
the
wheels
went
by
them
and
when
the
living
creatures
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
whithersoever
the
spirit
was
to
go
they
went
thither
was
their
spirit
to
go
and
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels
when
those
went
these
went
and
when
those
stood
these
stood
and
when
those
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
were
lifted
up
over
against
them
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
the
wheels
and
the
likeness
of
the
firmament
upon
the
heads
of
the
living
creature
was
as
the
colour
of
the
terrible
crystal
stretched
forth
over
their
heads
above
and
under
the
firmament
were
their
wings
straight
the
one
toward
the
other
every
one
had
two
which
covered
on
this
side
and
every
one
had
two
which
covered
on
that
side
their
bodies
and
when
they
went
i
heard
the
noise
of
their
wings
like
the
noise
of
great
waters
as
the
voice
of
the
almighty
the
voice
of
speech
as
the
noise
of
an
host
when
they
stood
they
let
down
their
wings
and
there
was
a
voice
from
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads
when
they
stood
and
had
let
down
their
wings
and
above
the
firmament
that
was
over
their
heads
was
the
likeness
of
a
throne
as
the
appearance
of
a
sapphire
stone
and
upon
the
likeness
of
the
throne
was
the
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
a
man
above
upon
it
and
i
saw
as
the
colour
of
amber
as
the
appearance
of
fire
round
about
within
it
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
upward
and
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward
i
saw
as
it
were
the
appearance
of
fire
and
it
had
brightness
round
about
as
the
appearance
of
the
bow
that
is
in
the
cloud
in
the
day
of
rain
so
was
the
appearance
of
the
brightness
round
about
this
was
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
the
glory
of
the
lord
and
when
i
saw
it
i
fell
upon
my
face
and
i
heard
a
voice
of
one
that
spake
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
stand
upon
thy
feet
and
i
will
speak
unto
thee
and
the
spirit
entered
into
me
when
he
spake
unto
me
and
set
me
upon
my
feet
that
i
heard
him
that
spake
unto
me
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
i
send
thee
to
the
children
of
israel
to
a
rebellious
nation
that
hath
rebelled
against
me
they
and
their
fathers
have
transgressed
against
me
even
unto
this
very
day
for
they
are
impudent
children
and
stiffhearted
i
do
send
thee
unto
them
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
and
they
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
yet
shall
know
that
there
hath
been
a
prophet
among
them
and
thou
son
of
man
be
not
afraid
of
them
neither
be
afraid
of
their
words
though
briers
and
thorns
be
with
thee
and
thou
dost
dwell
among
scorpions
be
not
afraid
of
their
words
nor
be
dismayed
at
their
looks
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
and
thou
shalt
speak
my
words
unto
them
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
for
they
are
most
rebellious
but
thou
son
of
man
hear
what
i
say
unto
thee
be
not
thou
rebellious
like
that
rebellious
house
open
thy
mouth
and
eat
that
i
give
thee
and
when
i
looked
behold
an
hand
was
sent
unto
me
and
lo
a
roll
of
a
book
was
therein
and
he
spread
it
before
me
and
it
was
written
within
and
without
and
there
was
written
therein
lamentations
and
mourning
and
woe
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
eat
that
thou
findest
eat
this
roll
and
go
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
so
i
opened
my
mouth
and
he
caused
me
to
eat
that
roll
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
cause
thy
belly
to
eat
and
fill
thy
bowels
with
this
roll
that
i
give
thee
then
did
i
eat
it
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
as
honey
for
sweetness
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
go
get
thee
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
speak
with
my
words
unto
them
for
thou
art
not
sent
to
a
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language
but
to
the
house
of
israel
not
to
many
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
of
an
hard
language
whose
words
thou
canst
not
understand
surely
had
i
sent
thee
to
them
they
would
have
hearkened
unto
thee
but
the
house
of
israel
will
not
hearken
unto
thee
for
they
will
not
hearken
unto
me
for
all
the
house
of
israel
are
impudent
and
hardhearted
behold
i
have
made
thy
face
strong
against
their
faces
and
thy
forehead
strong
against
their
foreheads
as
an
adamant
harder
than
flint
have
i
made
thy
forehead
fear
them
not
neither
be
dismayed
at
their
looks
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
all
my
words
that
i
shall
speak
unto
thee
receive
in
thine
heart
and
hear
with
thine
ears
and
go
get
thee
to
them
of
the
captivity
unto
the
children
of
thy
people
and
speak
unto
them
and
tell
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
then
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
i
heard
behind
me
a
voice
of
a
great
rushing
saying
blessed
be
the
glory
of
the
lord
from
his
place
i
heard
also
the
noise
of
the
wings
of
the
living
creatures
that
touched
one
another
and
the
noise
of
the
wheels
over
against
them
and
a
noise
of
a
great
rushing
so
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
and
took
me
away
and
i
went
in
bitterness
in
the
heat
of
my
spirit
but
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
strong
upon
me
then
i
came
to
them
of
the
captivity
at
telabib
that
dwelt
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
sat
where
they
sat
and
remained
there
astonished
among
them
seven
days
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
seven
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
i
have
made
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
israel
therefore
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth
and
give
them
warning
from
me
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
givest
him
not
warning
nor
speakest
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
wicked
way
to
save
his
life
the
same
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
yet
if
thou
warn
the
wicked
and
he
turn
not
from
his
wickedness
nor
from
his
wicked
way
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
again
when
a
righteous
man
doth
turn
from
his
righteousness
and
commit
iniquity
and
i
lay
a
stumbling-block
before
him
he
shall
die
because
thou
hast
not
given
him
warning
he
shall
die
in
his
sin
and
his
righteousness
which
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
remembered
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
nevertheless
if
thou
warn
the
righteous
man
that
the
righteous
sin
not
and
he
doth
not
sin
he
shall
surely
live
because
he
is
warned
also
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
there
upon
me
and
he
said
unto
me
arise
go
forth
into
the
plain
and
i
will
there
talk
with
thee
then
i
arose
and
went
forth
into
the
plain
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
stood
there
as
the
glory
which
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
fell
on
my
face
then
the
spirit
entered
into
me
and
set
me
upon
my
feet
and
spake
with
me
and
said
unto
me
go
shut
thyself
within
thine
house
but
thou
o
son
of
man
behold
they
shall
put
bands
upon
thee
and
shall
bind
thee
with
them
and
thou
shalt
not
go
out
among
them
and
i
will
make
thy
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
thy
mouth
that
thou
shalt
be
dumb
and
shalt
not
be
to
them
a
reprover
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
but
when
i
speak
with
thee
i
will
open
thy
mouth
and
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
he
that
heareth
let
him
hear
and
he
that
forbeareth
let
him
forbear
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
thou
also
son
of
man
take
thee
a
tile
and
lay
it
before
thee
and
pourtray
upon
it
the
city
even
jerusalem
and
lay
siege
against
it
and
build
a
fort
against
it
and
cast
a
mount
against
it
set
the
camp
also
against
it
and
set
battering
rams
against
it
round
about
moreover
take
thou
unto
thee
an
iron
pan
and
set
it
for
a
wall
of
iron
between
thee
and
the
city
and
set
thy
face
against
it
and
it
shall
be
besieged
and
thou
shalt
lay
siege
against
it
this
shall
be
a
sign
to
the
house
of
israel
lie
thou
also
upon
thy
left
side
and
lay
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
upon
it
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
it
thou
shalt
bear
their
iniquity
for
i
have
laid
upon
thee
the
years
of
their
iniquity
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
three
hundred
and
ninety
days
so
shalt
thou
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
and
when
thou
hast
accomplished
them
lie
again
on
thy
right
side
and
thou
shalt
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
judah
forty
days
i
have
appointed
thee
each
day
for
a
year
therefore
thou
shalt
set
thy
face
toward
the
siege
of
jerusalem
and
thine
arm
shall
be
uncovered
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
against
it
and
behold
i
will
lay
bands
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
turn
thee
from
one
side
to
another
till
thou
hast
ended
the
days
of
thy
siege
take
thou
also
unto
thee
wheat
and
barley
and
beans
and
lentiles
and
millet
and
fitches
and
put
them
in
one
vessel
and
make
thee
bread
thereof
according
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
thou
shalt
lie
upon
thy
side
three
hundred
and
ninety
days
shalt
thou
eat
thereof
and
thy
meat
which
thou
shalt
eat
shall
be
by
weight
twenty
shekels
a
day
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
eat
it
thou
shalt
drink
also
water
by
measure
the
sixth
part
of
an
hin
from
time
to
time
shalt
thou
drink
and
thou
shalt
eat
it
as
barley
cakes
and
thou
shalt
bake
it
with
dung
that
cometh
out
of
man
in
their
sight
and
the
lord
said
even
thus
shall
the
children
of
israel
eat
their
defiled
bread
among
the
gentiles
whither
i
will
drive
them
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
my
soul
hath
not
been
polluted
for
from
my
youth
up
even
till
now
have
i
not
eaten
of
that
which
dieth
of
itself
or
is
torn
in
pieces
neither
came
there
abominable
flesh
into
my
mouth
then
he
said
unto
me
lo
i
have
given
thee
cow's
dung
for
man's
dung
and
thou
shalt
prepare
thy
bread
therewith
moreover
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
behold
i
will
break
the
staff
of
bread
in
jerusalem
and
they
shall
eat
bread
by
weight
and
with
care
and
they
shall
drink
water
by
measure
and
with
astonishment
that
they
may
want
bread
and
water
and
be
astonied
one
with
another
and
consume
away
for
their
iniquity
and
thou
son
of
man
take
thee
a
sharp
knife
take
thee
a
barber's
razor
and
cause
it
to
pass
upon
thine
head
and
upon
thy
beard
then
take
thee
balances
to
weigh
and
divide
the
hair
thou
shalt
burn
with
fire
a
third
part
in
the
midst
of
the
city
when
the
days
of
the
siege
are
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
take
a
third
part
and
smite
about
it
with
a
knife
and
a
third
part
thou
shalt
scatter
in
the
wind
and
i
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them
thou
shalt
also
take
thereof
a
few
in
number
and
bind
them
in
thy
skirts
then
take
of
them
again
and
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
burn
them
in
the
fire
for
thereof
shall
a
fire
come
forth
into
all
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
this
is
jerusalem
i
have
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
nations
and
countries
that
are
round
about
her
and
she
hath
changed
my
judgments
into
wickedness
more
than
the
nations
and
my
statutes
more
than
the
countries
that
are
round
about
her
for
they
have
refused
my
judgments
and
my
statutes
they
have
not
walked
in
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
multiplied
more
than
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you
and
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes
neither
have
kept
my
judgments
neither
have
done
according
to
the
judgments
of
the
nations
that
are
round
about
you
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
even
i
am
against
thee
and
will
execute
judgments
in
the
midst
of
thee
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
and
i
will
do
in
thee
that
which
i
have
not
done
and
whereunto
i
will
not
do
any
more
the
like
because
of
all
thine
abominations
therefore
the
fathers
shall
eat
the
sons
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
the
sons
shall
eat
their
fathers
and
i
will
execute
judgments
in
thee
and
the
whole
remnant
of
thee
will
i
scatter
into
all
the
winds
wherefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
because
thou
hast
defiled
my
sanctuary
with
all
thy
detestable
things
and
with
all
thine
abominations
therefore
will
i
also
diminish
thee
neither
shall
mine
eye
spare
neither
will
i
have
any
pity
a
third
part
of
thee
shall
die
with
the
pestilence
and
with
famine
shall
they
be
consumed
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
a
third
part
shall
fall
by
the
sword
round
about
thee
and
i
will
scatter
a
third
part
into
all
the
winds
and
i
will
draw
out
a
sword
after
them
thus
shall
mine
anger
be
accomplished
and
i
will
cause
my
fury
to
rest
upon
them
and
i
will
be
comforted
and
they
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
in
my
zeal
when
i
have
accomplished
my
fury
in
them
moreover
i
will
make
thee
waste
and
a
reproach
among
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee
in
the
sight
of
all
that
pass
by
so
it
shall
be
a
reproach
and
a
taunt
an
instruction
and
an
astonishment
unto
the
nations
that
are
round
about
thee
when
i
shall
execute
judgments
in
thee
in
anger
and
in
fury
and
in
furious
rebukes
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
when
i
shall
send
upon
them
the
evil
arrows
of
famine
which
shall
be
for
their
destruction
and
which
i
will
send
to
destroy
you
and
i
will
increase
the
famine
upon
you
and
will
break
your
staff
of
bread
so
will
i
send
upon
you
famine
and
evil
beasts
and
they
shall
bereave
thee
and
pestilence
and
blood
shall
pass
through
thee
and
i
will
bring
the
sword
upon
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
set
thy
face
toward
the
mountains
of
israel
and
prophesy
against
them
and
say
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the

have
some
that
shall
escape
the
sword
among
the
nations
when
ye
shall
be
scattered
through
the
countries
and
they
that
escape
of
you
shall
remember
me
among
the
nations
whither
they
shall
be
carried
captives
because
i
am
broken
with
their
whorish
heart
which
hath
departed
from
me
and
with
their
eyes
which
go
a
whoring
after
their
idols
and
they
shall
lothe
themselves
for
the
evils
which
they
have
committed
in
all
their
abominations
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
that
i
have
not
said
in
vain
that
i
would
do
this
evil
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
smite
with
thine
hand
and
stamp
with
thy
foot
and
say
alas
for
all
the
evil
abominations
of
the
house
of
israel
for
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
he
that
is
far
off
shall
die
of
the
pestilence
and
he
that
is
near
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
he
that
remaineth
and
is
besieged
shall
die
by
the
famine
thus
will
i
accomplish
my
fury
upon
them
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
their
slain
men
shall
be
among
their
idols
round
about
their
altars
upon
every
high
hill
in
all
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
under
every
green
tree
and
under
every
thick
oak
the
place
where
they
did
offer
sweet
savour
to
all
their
idols
so
will
i
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
them
and
make
the
land
desolate
yea
more
desolate
than
the
wilderness
toward
diblath
in
all
their
habitations
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying

alive
for
the
vision
is
touching
the
whole

thereof
which

in
the
iniquity
of

even
to

but
none

the
battle
for
my
wrath

shall
escape
and
shall
be
on

mountains
like
doves
of
the
valleys
all
of
them
mourning
every
one
for
his
iniquity
all
hands
shall
be
feeble
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as
water
they
shall
also
gird
themselves
with
sackcloth
and
horror
shall
cover
them
and
shame
shall
be
upon
all
faces
and
baldness
upon
all
their
heads

their
silver
and
their
gold
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
them
in
the
day
of
the
wrath
of
the
lord
they
shall
not
satisfy
their
souls
neither
fill
their
bowels
because
it
is
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity
as
for
the
beauty
of
his
ornament
he
set
it
in
majesty
but
they
made
the
images
of
their
abominations
and
of
their
detestable
things
therein
therefore
have
i
set
it
far
from
them
and
i
will
give
it
into
the
hands
of
the
strangers
for
a
prey
and
to
the
wicked
of
the
earth
for
a
spoil
and
they
shall
pollute
it
my
face
will
i
turn
also
from
them
and
they
shall
pollute
my
secret
place
for
the
robbers
shall
enter
into
it
and
defile
it
make
a
chain
for
the
land
is
full
of
bloody
crimes
and
the
city
is
full
of
violence
wherefore
i
will
bring
the
worst
of
the
heathen
and
they
shall
possess
their
houses
i
will
also
make
the
pomp
of
the
strong
to
cease
and
their
holy
places
shall
be
defiled
destruction
cometh
and
they
shall
seek
peace
and
there
shall
be
none
mischief
shall
come
upon
mischief
and
rumour
shall
be
upon
rumour
then
shall
they
seek
a
vision
of
the
prophet
but
the
law
shall
perish
from
the
priest
and
counsel
from
the
ancients
the
king
shall
mourn
and
the
prince
shall
be
clothed
with
desolation
and
the
hands
of
the
people
of
the
land
shall
be
troubled
i
will
do
unto
them
after
their
way
and
according
to
their
deserts
will
i
judge
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year
in
the
sixth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
as
i
sat
in
mine
house
and
the
elders
of
judah
sat
before
me
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
god
fell
there
upon
me
then
i
beheld
and
lo
a
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
fire
from
the
appearance
of
his
loins
even
downward
fire
and
from
his
loins
even
upward
as
the
appearance
of
brightness
as
the
colour
of
amber
and
he
put
forth
the
form
of
an
hand
and
took
me
by
a
lock
of
mine
head
and
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven
and
brought
me
in
the
visions
of
god
to
jerusalem
to
the
door
of
the
inner
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
north
where
was
the
seat
of
the
image
of
jealousy
which
provoketh
to
jealousy
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
there
according
to
the
vision
that
i
saw
in
the
plain
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
lift
up
thine
eyes
now
the
way
toward
the
north
so
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
the
way
toward
the
north
and
behold
northward
at
the
gate
of
the
altar
this
image
of
jealousy
in
the
entry
he
said
furthermore
unto
me
son
of
man
seest
thou
what
they
do
even
the
great
abominations
that
the
house
of
israel
committeth
here
that
i
should
go
far
off
from
my
sanctuary
but
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
and
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
court
and
when
i
looked
behold
a
hole
in
the
wall
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
dig
now
in
the
wall
and
when
i
had
digged
in
the
wall
behold
a
door
and
he
said
unto
me
go
in
and
behold
the
wicked
abominations
that
they
do
here
so
i
went
in
and
saw
and
behold
every
form
of
creeping
things
and
abominable
beasts
and
all
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall
round
about
and
there
stood
before
them
seventy
men
of
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
jaazaniah
the
son
of
shaphan
with
every
man
his
censer
in
his
hand
and
a
thick
cloud
of
incense
went
up
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
hast
thou
seen
what
the
ancients
of
the
house
of
israel
do
in
the
dark
every
man
in
the
chambers
of
his
imagery
for
they
say
the
lord
seeth
us
not
the
lord
hath
forsaken
the
earth
he
said
also
unto
me
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
that
they
do
then
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
gate
of
the
lord's
house
which
was
toward
the
north
and
behold
there
sat
women
weeping
for
tammuz
then
said
he
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
turn
thee
yet
again
and
thou
shalt
see
greater
abominations
than
these
and
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
of
the
lord's
house
and
behold
at
the
door
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
were
about
five
and
twenty
men
with
their
backs
toward
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
their
faces
toward
the
east
and
they
worshipped
the
sun
toward
the
east
then
he
said
unto
me
hast
thou
seen
this
o
son
of
man
is
it
a
light
thing
to
the
house
of
judah
that
they
commit
the
abominations
which
they
commit
here
for
they
have
filled
the
land
with
violence
and
have
returned
to
provoke
me
to
anger
and
lo
they
put
the
branch
to
their
nose
therefore
will
i
also
deal
in
fury
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
and
though
they
cry
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice
yet
will
i
not
hear
them
he
cried
also
in
mine
ears
with
a
loud
voice
saying
cause
them
that
have
charge
over
the
city
to
draw
near
even
every
man
with
his
destroying
weapon
in
his
hand
and
behold
six
men
came
from
the
way
of
the
higher
gate
which
lieth
toward
the
north
and
every
man
a
slaughter
weapon
in
his
hand
and
one
man
among
them
was
clothed
with
linen
with
a
writer's
inkhorn
by
his
side
and
they
went
in
and
stood
beside
the
brasen
altar
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
gone
up
from
the
cherub
whereupon
he
was
to
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
he
called
to
the
man
clothed
with
linen
which
had
the
writer's
inkhorn
by
his
side
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
through
the
midst
of
the
city
through
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
set
a
mark
upon
the
foreheads
of
the
men
that
sigh
and
that
cry
for
all
the
abominations
that
be
done
in
the
midst
thereof
and
to
the
others
he
said
in
mine
hearing
go
ye
after
him
through
the
city
and
smite
let
not
your
eye
spare
neither
have
ye
pity
slay
utterly
old
and
young
both
maids
and
little
children
and
women
but
come
not
near
any
man
upon
whom
is
the
mark
and
begin
at
my
sanctuary
then
they
began
at
the
ancient
men
which
were
before
the
house
and
he
said
unto
them
defile
the
house
and
fill
the
courts
with
the
slain
go
ye
forth
and
they
went
forth
and
slew
in
the
city
and
it
came
to
pass
while
they
were
slaying
them
and
i
was
left
that
i
fell
upon
my
face
and
cried
and
said
ah
lord
god
wilt
thou
destroy
all
the
residue
of
israel
in
thy
pouring
out
of
thy
fury
upon
jerusalem
then
said
he
unto
me
the
iniquity
of
the
house
of
israel
and
judah
is
exceeding
great
and
the
land
is
full
of
blood
and
the
city
full
of
perverseness
for
they
say
the
lord
hath
forsaken
the
earth
and
the
lord
seeth
not
and
as
for
me
also
mine
eye
shall
not
spare
neither
will
i
have
pity
but
i
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
head
and
behold
the
man
clothed
with
linen
which
had
the
inkhorn
by
his
side
reported
the
matter
saying
i
have
done
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
then
i
looked
and
behold
in
the
firmament
that
was
above
the
head
of
the
cherubims
there
appeared
over
them
as
it
were
a
sapphire
stone
as
the
appearance
of
the
likeness
of
a
throne
and
he
spake
unto
the
man
clothed
with
linen
and
said
go
in
between
the
wheels
even
under
the
cherub
and
fill
thine
hand
with
coals
of
fire
from
between
the
cherubims
and
scatter
them
over
the
city
and
he
went
in
in
my
sight
now
the
cherubims
stood
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
when
the
man
went
in
and
the
cloud
filled
the
inner
court
then
the
glory
of
the
lord
went
up
from
the
cherub
and
stood
over
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
cloud
and
the
court
was
full
of
the
brightness
of
the
lord's
glory
and
the
sound
of
the
cherubims
wings
was
heard
even
to
the
outer
court
as
the
voice
of
the
almighty
god
when
he
speaketh
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
commanded
the
man
clothed
with
linen
saying
take
fire
from
between
the
wheels
from
between
the
cherubims
then
he
went
in
and
stood
beside
the
wheels
and
one
cherub
stretched
forth
his
hand
from
between
the
cherubims
unto
the
fire
that
was
between
the
cherubims
and
took
thereof
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
him
that
was
clothed
with
linen
who
took
it
and
went
out
and
there
appeared
in
the
cherubims
the
form
of
a
man's
hand
under
their
wings
and
when
i
looked
behold
the
four
wheels
by
the
cherubims
one
wheel
by
one
cherub
and
another
wheel
by
another
cherub
and
the
appearance
of
the
wheels
was
as
the
colour
of
a
beryl
stone
and
as
for
their
appearances
they
four
had
one
likeness
as
if
a
wheel
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
wheel
when
they
went
they
went
upon
their
four
sides
they
turned
not
as
they
went
but
to
the
place
whither
the
head
looked
they
followed
it
they
turned
not
as
they
went
and
their
whole
body
and
their
backs
and
their
hands
and
their
wings
and
the
wheels
were
full
of
eyes
round
about
even
the
wheels
that
they
four
had
as
for
the
wheels
it
was
cried
unto
them
in
my
hearing
o
wheel
and
every
one
had
four
faces
the
first
face
was
the
face
of
a
cherub
and
the
second
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
and
the
third
the
face
of
a
lion
and
the
fourth
the
face
of
an
eagle
and
the
cherubims
were
lifted
up
this
is
the
living
creature
that
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
when
the
cherubims
went
the
wheels
went
by
them
and
when
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings
to
mount
up
from
the
earth
the
same
wheels
also
turned
not
from
beside
them
when
they
stood
these
stood
and
when
they
were
lifted
up
these
lifted
up
themselves
also
for
the
spirit
of
the
living
creature
was
in
them
then
the
glory
of
the
lord
departed
from
off
the
threshold
of
the
house
and
stood
over
the
cherubims
and
the
cherubims
lifted
up
their
wings
and
mounted
up
from
the
earth
in
my
sight
when
they
went
out
the
wheels
also
were
beside
them
and
every
one
stood
at
the
door
of
the
east
gate
of
the
lord's
house
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
over
them
above
this
is
the
living
creature
that
i
saw
under
the
god
of
israel
by
the
river
of
chebar
and
i
knew
that
they
were
the
cherubims
every
one
had
four
faces
apiece
and
every
one
four
wings
and
the
likeness
of
the
hands
of
a
man
was
under
their
wings
and
the
likeness
of
their
faces
was
the
same
faces
which
i
saw
by
the
river
of
chebar
their
appearances
and
themselves
they
went
every
one
straight
forward
moreover
the
spirit
lifted
me
up
and
brought
me
unto
the
east
gate
of
the
lord's
house
which
looketh
eastward
and
behold
at
the
door
of
the
gate
five
and
twenty
men
among
whom
i
saw
jaazaniah
the
son
of
azur
and
pelatiah
the
son
of
benaiah
princes
of
the
people
then
said
he
unto
me
son
of
man
these
are
the
men
that
devise
mischief
and
give
wicked
counsel
in
this
city
which
say
it
is
not
near
let
us
build
houses
this
city
is
the
caldron
and
we
be
the
flesh
therefore
prophesy
against
them
prophesy
o
son
of
man
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
fell
upon
me
and
said
unto
me
speak
thus
saith
the
lord
thus
have
ye
said
o
house
of
israel
for
i
know
the
things
that
come
into
your
mind
every
one
of
them
ye
have
multiplied
your
slain
in
this
city
and
ye
have
filled
the
streets
thereof
with
the
slain
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
your
slain
whom
ye
have
laid
in
the
midst
of
it
they
are
the
flesh
and
this
city
is
the
caldron
but
i
will
bring
you
forth
out
of
the
midst
of
it
ye
have
feared
the
sword
and
i
will
bring
a
sword
upon
you
saith
the
lord
god
and
i
will
bring
you
out
of
the
midst
thereof
and
deliver
you
into
the
hands
of
strangers
and
will
execute
judgments
among
you
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword
i
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
this
city
shall
not
be
your
caldron
neither
shall
ye
be
the
flesh
in
the
midst
thereof
but
i
will
judge
you
in
the
border
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
ye
have
not
walked
in
my
statutes
neither
executed
my
judgments
but
have
done
after
the
manners
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
you
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
prophesied
that
pelatiah
the
son
of
benaiah
died
then
fell
i
down
upon
my
face
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
ah
lord
god
wilt
thou
make
a
full
end
of
the
remnant
of
israel
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
thy
brethren
even
thy
brethren
the
men
of
thy
kindred
and
all
the
house
of
israel
wholly
are
they
unto
whom
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
have
said
get
you
far
from
the
lord
unto
us
is
this
land
given
in
possession
therefore
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
although
i
have
cast
them
far
off
among
the
heathen
and
although
i
have
scattered
them
among
the
countries
yet
will
i
be
to
them
as
a
little
sanctuary
in
the
countries
where
they
shall
come
therefore
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
gather
you
from
the
people
and
assemble
you
out
of
the
countries
where
ye
have
been
scattered
and
i
will
give
you
the
land
of
israel
and
they
shall
come
thither
and
they
shall
take
away
all
the
detestable
things
thereof
and
all
the
abominations
thereof
from
thence
and
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
i
will
put
a
new
spirit
within
you
and
i
will
take
the
stony
heart
out
of
their
flesh
and
will
give
them
an
heart
of
flesh
that
they
may
walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
mine
ordinances
and
do
them
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
their
god
but
as
for
them
whose
heart
walketh
after
the
heart
of
their
detestable
things
and
their
abominations
i
will
recompense
their
way
upon
their
own
heads
saith
the
lord
god
then
did
the
cherubims
lift
up
their
wings
and
the
wheels
beside
them
and
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
was
over
them
above
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
went
up
from
the
midst
of
the
city
and
stood
upon
the
mountain
which
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
afterwards
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
brought
me
in
a
vision
by
the
spirit
of
god
into
chaldea
to
them
of
the
captivity
so
the
vision
that
i
had
seen
went
up
from
me
then
i
spake
unto
them
of
the
captivity
all
the
things
that
the
lord
had
shewed
me
the
word
of
the
lord
also
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
thou
dwellest
in
the
midst
of
a
rebellious
house
which
have
eyes
to
see
and
see
not
they
have
ears
to
hear
and
hear
not
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
therefore
thou
son
of
man
prepare
thee
stuff
for
removing
and
remove
by
day
in
their
sight
and
thou
shalt
remove
from
thy
place
to
another
place
in
their
sight
it
may
be
they
will
consider
though
they
be
a
rebellious
house
then
shalt
thou
bring
forth
thy
stuff
by
day
in
their
sight
as
stuff
for
removing
and
thou
shalt
go
forth
at
even
in
their
sight
as
they
that
go
forth
into
captivity
dig
thou
through
the
wall
in
their
sight
and
carry
out
thereby
in
their
sight
shalt
thou
bear
it
upon
thy
shoulders
and
carry
it
forth
in
the
twilight
thou
shalt
cover
thy
face
that
thou
see
not
the
ground
for
i
have
set
thee
for
a
sign
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
i
did
so
as
i
was
commanded
i
brought
forth
my
stuff
by
day
as
stuff
for
captivity
and
in
the
even
i
digged
through
the
wall
with
mine
hand
i
brought
it
forth
in
the
twilight
and
i
bare
it
upon
my
shoulder
in
their
sight
and
in
the
morning
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
hath
not
the
house
of
israel
the
rebellious
house
said
unto
thee
what
doest
thou
say
thou
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
this
burden
concerneth
the
prince
in
jerusalem
and
all
the
house
of
israel
that
are
among
them
say
i
am
your
sign
like
as
i
have
done
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
them
they
shall
remove
and
go
into
captivity
and
the
prince
that
is
among
them
shall
bear
upon
his
shoulder
in
the
twilight
and
shall
go
forth
they
shall
dig
through
the
wall
to
carry
out
thereby
he
shall
cover
his
face
that
he
see
not
the
ground
with
his
eyes
my
net
also
will
i
spread
upon
him
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare
and
i
will
bring
him
to
babylon
to
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
yet
shall
he
not
see
it
though
he
shall
die
there
and
i
will
scatter
toward
every
wind
all
that
are
about
him
to
help
him
and
all
his
bands
and
i
will
draw
out
the
sword
after
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
scatter
them
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
in
the
countries
but
i
will
leave
a
few
men
of
them
from
the
sword
from
the
famine
and
from
the
pestilence
that
they
may
declare
all
their
abominations
among
the
heathen
whither
they
come
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
son
of
man
eat
thy
bread
with
quaking
and
drink
thy
water
with
trembling
and
with
carefulness
and
say
unto
the
people
of
the
land
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
of
the
land
of
israel
they
shall
eat
their
bread
with
carefulness
and
drink
their
water
with
astonishment
that
her
land
may
be
desolate
from
all
that
is
therein
because
of
the
violence
of
all
them
that
dwell
therein
and
the
cities
that
are
inhabited
shall
be
laid
waste
and
the
land
shall
be
desolate
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
what
is
that
proverb
that
ye
have
in
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
days
are
prolonged
and
every
vision
faileth
tell
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
make
this
proverb
to
cease
and
they
shall
no
more
use
it
as
a
proverb
in
israel
but
say
unto
them
the
days
are
at
hand
and
the
effect
of
every
vision
for
there
shall
be
no
more
any
vain
vision
nor
flattering
divination
within
the
house
of
israel
for
i
am
the
lord
i
will
speak
and
the
word
that
i
shall
speak
shall
come
to
pass
it
shall
be
no
more
prolonged
for
in
your
days
o
rebellious
house
will
i
say
the
word
and
will
perform
it
saith
the
lord
god
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
son
of
man
behold
they
of
the
house
of
israel
say
the
vision
that
he
seeth
is
for
many
days
to
come
and
he
prophesieth
of
the
times
that
are
far
off
therefore
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
none
of
my
words
be
prolonged
any
more
but
the
word
which
i
have
spoken
shall
be
done
saith
the
lord
god
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
prophets
of
israel
that
prophesy
and
say
thou
unto
them
that
prophesy
out
of
their
own
hearts
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
unto
the
foolish
prophets
that
follow
their
own
spirit
and
have
seen
nothing
o
israel
thy
prophets
are
like
the
foxes
in
the
deserts
ye
have
not
gone
up
into
the
gaps
neither
made
up
the
hedge
for
the
house
of
israel
to
stand
in
the
battle
in
the
day
of
the
lord
they
have
seen
vanity
and
lying
divination
saying
the
lord
saith
and
the
lord
hath
not
sent
them
and
they
have
made
others
to
hope
that
they
would
confirm
the
word
have
ye
not
seen
a
vain
vision
and
have
ye
not
spoken
a
lying
divination
whereas
ye
say
the
lord
saith
it
albeit
i
have
not
spoken
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
have
spoken
vanity
and
seen
lies
therefore
behold
i
am
against
you
saith
the
lord
god
and
mine
hand
shall
be
upon
the
prophets
that
see
vanity
and
that
divine
lies
they
shall
not
be
in
the
assembly
of
my
people
neither
shall
they
be
written
in
the
writing
of
the
house
of
israel
neither
shall
they
enter
into
the
land
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
because
even
because
they
have
seduced
my
people
saying
peace
and
there
was
no
peace
and
one
built
up
a
wall
and
lo
others
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter
say
unto
them
which
daub
it
with
untempered
morter
that
it
shall
fall
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower
and
ye
o
great
hailstones
shall
fall
and
a
stormy
wind
shall
rend
it
lo
when
the
wall
is
fallen
shall
it
not
be
said
unto
you
where
is
the
daubing
wherewith
ye
have
daubed
it
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
rend
it
with
a
stormy
wind
in
my
fury
and
there
shall
be
an
overflowing
shower
in
mine
anger
and
great
hailstones
in
my
fury
to
consume
it
so
will
i
break
down
the
wall
that
ye
have
daubed
with
untempered
morter
and
bring
it
down
to
the
ground
so
that
the
foundation
thereof
shall
be
discovered
and
it
shall
fall
and
ye
shall
be
consumed
in
the
midst
thereof
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
thus
will
i
accomplish
my
wrath
upon
the
wall
and
upon
them
that
have
daubed
it
with
untempered
morter
and
will
say
unto
you
the
wall
is
no
more
neither
they
that
daubed
it
to
wit
the
prophets
of
israel
which
prophesy
concerning
jerusalem
and
which
see
visions
of
peace
for
her
and
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
god
likewise
thou
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
the
daughters
of
thy
people
which
prophesy
out
of
their
own
heart
and
prophesy
thou
against
them
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
women
that
sew
pillows
to
all
armholes
and
make
kerchiefs
upon
the
head
of
every
stature
to
hunt
souls
will
ye
hunt
the
souls
of
my
people
and
will
ye
save
the
souls
alive
that
come
unto
you
and
will
ye
pollute
me
among
my
people
for
handfuls
of
barley
and
for
pieces
of
bread
to
slay
the
souls
that
should
not
die
and
to
save
the
souls
alive
that
should
not
live
by
your
lying
to
my
people
that
hear
your
lies
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
your
pillows
wherewith
ye
there
hunt
the
souls
to
make
them
fly
and
i
will
tear
them
from
your
arms
and
will
let
the
souls
go
even
the
souls
that
ye
hunt
to
make
them
fly
your
kerchiefs
also
will
i
tear
and
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand
and
they
shall
be
no
more
in
your
hand
to
be
hunted
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
because
with
lies
ye
have
made
the
heart
of
the
righteous
sad
whom
i
have
not
made
sad
and
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
wicked
that
he
should
not
return
from
his
wicked
way
by
promising
him
life
therefore
ye
shall
see
no
more
vanity
nor
divine
divinations
for
i
will
deliver
my
people
out
of
your
hand
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
then
came
certain
of
the
elders
of
israel
unto
me
and
sat
before
me
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
these
men
have
set
up
their
idols
in
their
heart
and
put
the
stumblingblock
of
their
iniquity
before
their
face
should
i
be
enquired
of
at
all
by
them
therefore
speak
unto
them
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
every
man
of
the
house
of
israel
that
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
to
the
prophet
i
the
lord
will
answer
him
that
cometh
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
idols
that
i
may
take
the
house
of
israel
in
their
own
heart
because
they
are
all
estranged
from
me
through
their
idols
therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
repent
and
turn
yourselves
from
your
idols
and
turn
away
your
faces
from
all
your
abominations
for
every
one
of
the
house
of
israel
or
of
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
in
israel
which
separateth
himself
from
me
and
setteth
up
his
idols
in
his
heart
and
putteth
the
stumblingblock
of
his
iniquity
before
his
face
and
cometh
to
a
prophet
to
enquire
of
him
concerning
me
i
the
lord
will
answer
him
by
myself
and
i
will
set
my
face
against
that
man
and
will
make
him
a
sign
and
a
proverb
and
i
will
cut
him
off
from
the
midst
of
my
people
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
if
the
prophet
be
deceived
when
he
hath
spoken
a
thing
i
the
lord
have
deceived
that
prophet
and
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
him
and
will
destroy
him
from
the
midst
of
my
people
israel
and
they
shall
bear
the
punishment
of
their
iniquity
the
punishment
of
the
prophet
shall
be
even
as
the
punishment
of
him
that
seeketh
unto
him
that
the
house
of
israel
may
go
no
more
astray
from
me
neither
be
polluted
any
more
with
all
their
transgressions
but
that
they
may
be
my
people
and
i
may
be
their
god
saith
the
lord
god
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
to
me
saying
son
of
man
when
the
land
sinneth
against
me
by
trespassing
grievously
then
will
i
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
it
and
will
break
the
staff
of
the
bread
thereof
and
will
send
famine
upon
it
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
though
these
three
men
noah
daniel
and
job
were
in
it
they
should
deliver
but
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness
saith
the
lord
god
if
i
cause
noisome
beasts
to
pass
through
the
land
and
they
spoil
it
so
that
it
be
desolate
that
no
man
may
pass
through
because
of
the
beasts
though
these
three
men
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters
they
only
shall
be
delivered
but
the
land
shall
be
desolate
or
if
i
bring
a
sword
upon
that
land
and
say
sword
go
through
the
land
so
that
i
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
though
these
three
men
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
sons
nor
daughters
but
they
only
shall
be
delivered
themselves
or
if
i
send
a
pestilence
into
that
land
and
pour
out
my
fury
upon
it
in
blood
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast
though
noah
daniel
and
job
were
in
it
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
deliver
neither
son
nor
daughter
they
shall
but
deliver
their
own
souls
by
their
righteousness
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
how
much
more
when
i
send
my
four
sore
judgments
upon
jerusalem
the
sword
and
the
famine
and
the
noisome
beast
and
the
pestilence
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
beast
yet
behold
therein
shall
be
left
a
remnant
that
shall
be
brought
forth
both
sons
and
daughters
behold
they
shall
come
forth
unto
you
and
ye
shall
see
their
way
and
their
doings
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
concerning
the
evil
that
i
have
brought
upon
jerusalem
even
concerning
all
that
i
have
brought
upon
it
and
they
shall
comfort
you
when
ye
see
their
ways
and
their
doings
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
have
not
done
without
cause
all
that
i
have
done
in
it
saith
the
lord
god
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
what
is
the
vine
tree
more
than
any
tree
or
than
a
branch
which
is
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
shall
wood
be
taken
thereof
to
do
any
work
or
will
men
take
a
pin
of
it
to
hang
any
vessel
thereon
behold
it
is
cast
into
the
fire
for
fuel
the
fire
devoureth
both
the
ends
of
it
and
the
midst
of
it
is
burned
is
it
meet
for
any
work
behold
when
it
was
whole
it
was
meet
for
no
work
how
much
less
shall
it
be
meet
yet
for
any
work
when
the
fire
hath
devoured
it
and
it
is
burned
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
the
vine
tree
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
which
i
have
given
to
the
fire
for
fuel
so
will
i
give
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
i
will
set
my
face
against
them
they
shall
go
out
from
one
fire
and
another
fire
shall
devour
them
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
set
my
face
against
them
and
i
will
make
the
land
desolate
because
they
have
committed
a
trespass
saith
the
lord
god
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
cause
jerusalem
to
know
her
abominations
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
jerusalem
thy
birth
and
thy
nativity
is
of
the
land
of
canaan
thy
father
was
an
amorite
and
thy
mother
an
hittite
and
as
for
thy
nativity
in
the
day
thou
wast
born
thy
navel
was
not
cut
neither
wast
thou
washed
in
water
to
supple
thee
thou
wast
not
salted
at
all
nor
swaddled
at
all
none
eye
pitied
thee
to
do
any
of
these
unto
thee
to
have
compassion
upon
thee
but
thou
wast
cast
out
in
the
open
field
to
the
lothing
of
thy
person
in
the
day
that
thou
wast
born
and
when
i
passed
by
thee
and
saw
thee
polluted
in
thine
own
blood
i
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood
live
yea
i
said
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
in
thy
blood
live
i
have
caused
thee
to
multiply
as
the
bud
of
the
field
and
thou
hast
increased
and
waxen
great
and
thou
art
come
to
excellent
ornaments
thy
breasts
are
fashioned
and
thine
hair
is
grown
whereas
thou
wast
naked
and
bare
now
when
i
passed
by
thee
and
looked
upon
thee
behold
thy
time
was
the
time
of
love
and
i
spread
my
skirt
over
thee
and
covered
thy
nakedness
yea
i
sware
unto
thee
and
entered
into
a
covenant
with
thee
saith
the
lord
god
and
thou
becamest
mine
then
washed
i
thee
with
water
yea
i
throughly
washed
away
thy
blood
from
thee
and
i
anointed
thee
with
oil
i
clothed
thee
also
with
broidered
work
and
shod
thee
with
badgers
skin
and
i
girded
thee
about
with
fine
linen
and
i
covered
thee
with
silk
i
decked
thee
also
with
ornaments
and
i
put
bracelets
upon
thy
hands
and
a
chain
on
thy
neck
and
i
put
a
jewel
on
thy
forehead
and
earrings
in
thine
ears
and
a
beautiful
crown
upon
thine
head
thus
wast
thou
decked
with
gold
and
silver
and
thy
raiment
was
of
fine
linen
and
silk
and
broidered
work
thou
didst
eat
fine
flour
and
honey
and
oil
and
thou
wast
exceeding
beautiful
and
thou
didst
prosper
into
a
kingdom
and
thy
renown
went
forth
among
the
heathen
for
thy
beauty
for
it
was
perfect
through
my
comeliness
which
i
had
put
upon
thee
saith
the
lord
god
but
thou
didst
trust
in
thine
own
beauty
and
playedst
the
harlot
because
of
thy
renown
and
pouredst
out
thy
fornications
on
every
one
that
passed
by
his
it
was
and
of
thy
garments
thou
didst
take
and
deckedst
thy
high
places
with
divers
colours
and
playedst
the
harlot
thereupon
the
like
things
shall
not
come
neither
shall
it
be
so
thou
hast
also
taken
thy
fair
jewels
of
my
gold
and
of
my
silver
which
i
had
given
thee
and
madest
to
thyself
images
of
men
and
didst
commit
whoredom
with
them
and
tookest
thy
broidered
garments
and
coveredst
them
and
thou
hast
set
mine
oil
and
mine
incense
before
them
my
meat
also
which
i
gave
thee
fine
flour
and
oil
and
honey
wherewith
i
fed
thee
thou
hast
even
set
it
before
them
for
a
sweet
savour
and
thus
it
was
saith
the
lord
god
moreover
thou
hast
taken
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
whom
thou
hast
borne
unto
me
and
these
hast
thou
sacrificed
unto
them
to
be
devoured
is
this
of
thy
whoredoms
a
small
matter
that
thou
hast
slain
my
children
and
delivered
them
to
cause
them
to
pass
through
the
fire
for
them
and
in
all
thine
abominations
and
thy
whoredoms
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth
when
thou
wast
naked
and
bare
and
wast
polluted
in
thy
blood
and
it
came
to
pass
after
all
thy
wickedness
woe
woe
unto
thee
saith
the
lord
god
that
thou
hast
also
built
unto
thee
an
eminent
place
and
hast
made
thee
an
high
place
in
every
street
thou
hast
built
thy
high
place
at
every
head
of
the
way
and
hast
made
thy
beauty
to
be
abhorred
and
hast
opened
thy
feet
to
every
one
that
passed
by
and
multiplied
thy
whoredoms
thou
hast
also
committed
fornication
with
the
egyptians
thy
neighbours
great
of
flesh
and
hast
increased
thy
whoredoms
to
provoke
me
to
anger
behold
therefore
i
have
stretched
out
my
hand
over
thee
and
have
diminished
thine
ordinary
food
and
delivered
thee
unto
the
will
of
them
that
hate
thee
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
which
are
ashamed
of
thy
lewd
way
thou
hast
played
the
whore
also
with
the
assyrians
because
thou
wast
unsatiable
yea
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
them
and
yet
couldest
not
be
satisfied
thou
hast
moreover
multiplied
thy
fornication
in
the
land
of
canaan
unto
chaldea
and
yet
thou
wast
not
satisfied
therewith
how
weak
is
thine
heart
saith
the
lord
god
seeing
thou
doest
all
these
things
the
work
of
an
imperious
whorish
woman
in
that
thou
buildest
thine
eminent
place
in
the
head
of
every
way
and
makest
thine
high
place
in
every
street
and
hast
not
been
as
an
harlot
in
that
thou
scornest
hire
but
as
a
wife
that
committeth
adultery
which
taketh
strangers
instead
of
her
husband
they
give
gifts
to
all
whores
but
thou
givest
thy
gifts
to
all
thy
lovers
and
hirest
them
that
they
may
come
unto
thee
on
every
side
for
thy
whoredom
and
the
contrary
is
in
thee
from
other
women
in
thy
whoredoms
whereas
none
followeth
thee
to
commit
whoredoms
and
in
that
thou
givest
a
reward
and
no
reward
is
given
unto
thee
therefore
thou
art
contrary
wherefore
o
harlot
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thy
filthiness
was
poured
out
and
thy
nakedness
discovered
through
thy
whoredoms
with
thy
lovers
and
with
all
the
idols
of
thy
abominations
and
by
the
blood
of
thy
children
which
thou
didst
give
unto
them
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
all
thy
lovers
with
whom
thou
hast
taken
pleasure
and
all
them
that
thou
hast
loved
with
all
them
that
thou
hast
hated
i
will
even
gather
them
round
about
against
thee
and
will
discover
thy
nakedness
unto
them
that
they
may
see
all
thy
nakedness
and
i
will
judge
thee
as
women
that
break
wedlock
and
shed
blood
are
judged
and
i
will
give
thee
blood
in
fury
and
jealousy
and
i
will
also
give
thee
into
their
hand
and
they
shall
throw
down
thine
eminent
place
and
shall
break
down
thy
high
places
they
shall
strip
thee
also
of
thy
clothes
and
shall
take
thy
fair
jewels
and
leave
thee
naked
and
bare
they
shall
also
bring
up
a
company
against
thee
and
they
shall
stone
thee
with
stones
and
thrust
thee
through
with
their
swords
and
they
shall
burn
thine
houses
with
fire
and
execute
judgments
upon
thee
in
the
sight
of
many
women
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
cease
from
playing
the
harlot
and
thou
also
shalt
give
no
hire
any
more
so
will
i
make
my
fury
toward
thee
to
rest
and
my
jealousy
shall
depart
from
thee
and
i
will
be
quiet
and
will
be
no
more
angry
because
thou
hast
not
remembered
the
days
of
thy
youth
but
hast
fretted
me
in
all
these
things
behold
therefore
i
also
will
recompense
thy
way
upon
thine
head
saith
the
lord
god
and
thou
shalt
not
commit
this
lewdness
above
all
thine
abominations
behold
every
one
that
useth
proverbs
shall
use
this
proverb
against
thee
saying
as
is
the
mother
so
is
her
daughter
thou
art
thy
mother's
daughter
that
lotheth
her
husband
and
her
children
and
thou
art
the
sister
of
thy
sisters
which
lothed
their
husbands
and
their
children
your
mother
was
an
hittite
and
your
father
an
amorite
and
thine
elder
sister
is
samaria
she
and
her
daughters
that
dwell
at
thy
left
hand
and
thy
younger
sister
that
dwelleth
at
thy
right
hand
is
sodom
and
her
daughters
yet
hast
thou
not
walked
after
their
ways
nor
done
after
their
abominations
but
as
if
that
were
a
very
little
thing
thou
wast
corrupted
more
than
they
in
all
thy
ways
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
sodom
thy
sister
hath
not
done
she
nor
her
daughters
as
thou
hast
done
thou
and
thy
daughters
behold
this
was
the
iniquity
of
thy
sister
sodom
pride
fulness
of
bread
and
abundance
of
idleness
was
in
her
and
in
her
daughters
neither
did
she
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
poor
and
needy
and
they
were
haughty
and
committed
abomination
before
me
therefore
i
took
them
away
as
i
saw
good
neither
hath
samaria
committed
half
of
thy
sins
but
thou
hast
multiplied
thine
abominations
more
than
they
and
hast
justified
thy
sisters
in
all
thine
abominations
which
thou
hast
done
thou
also
which
hast
judged
thy
sisters
bear
thine
own
shame
for
thy
sins
that
thou
hast
committed
more
abominable
than
they
they
are
more
righteous
than
thou
yea
be
thou
confounded
also
and
bear
thy
shame
in
that
thou
hast
justified
thy
sisters
when
i
shall
bring
again
their
captivity
the
captivity
of
sodom
and
her
daughters
and
the
captivity
of
samaria
and
her
daughters
then
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
thy
captives
in
the
midst
of
them
that
thou
mayest
bear
thine
own
shame
and
mayest
be
confounded
in
all
that
thou
hast
done
in
that
thou
art
a
comfort
unto
them
when
thy
sisters
sodom
and
her
daughters
shall
return
to
their
former
estate
and
samaria
and
her
daughters
shall
return
to
their
former
estate
then
thou
and
thy
daughters
shall
return
to
your
former
estate
for
thy
sister
sodom
was
not
mentioned
by
thy
mouth
in
the
day
of
thy
pride
before
thy
wickedness
was
discovered
as
at
the
time
of
thy
reproach
of
the
daughters
of
syria
and
all
that
are
round
about
her
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
which
despise
thee
round
about
thou
hast
borne
thy
lewdness
and
thine
abominations
saith
the
lord
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
deal
with
thee
as
thou
hast
done
which
hast
despised
the
oath
in
breaking
the
covenant
nevertheless
i
will
remember
my
covenant
with
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
and
i
will
establish
unto
thee
an
everlasting
covenant
then
thou
shalt
remember
thy
ways
and
be
ashamed
when
thou
shalt
receive
thy
sisters
thine
elder
and
thy
younger
and
i
will
give
them
unto
thee
for
daughters
but
not
by
thy
covenant
and
i
will
establish
my
covenant
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
thou
mayest
remember
and
be
confounded
and
never
open
thy
mouth
any
more
because
of
thy
shame
when
i
am
pacified
toward
thee
for
all
that
thou
hast
done
saith
the
lord
god
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
put
forth
a
riddle
and
speak
a
parable
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
a
great
eagle
with
great
wings
longwinged
full
of
feathers
which
had
divers
colours
came
unto
lebanon
and
took
the
highest
branch
of
the
cedar
he
cropped
off
the
top
of
his
young
twigs
and
carried
it
into
a
land
of
traffick
he
set
it
in
a
city
of
merchants
he
took
also
of
the
seed
of
the
land
and
planted
it
in
a
fruitful
field
he
placed
it
by
great
waters
and
set
it
as
a
willow
tree
and
it
grew
and
became
a
spreading
vine
of
low
stature
whose
branches
turned
toward
him
and
the
roots
thereof
were
under
him
so
it
became
a
vine
and
brought
forth
branches
and
shot
forth
sprigs
there
was
also
another
great
eagle
with
great
wings
and
many
feathers
and
behold
this
vine
did
bend
her
roots
toward
him
and
shot
forth
her
branches
toward
him
that
he
might
water
it
by
the
furrows
of
her
plantation
it
was
planted
in
a
good
soil
by
great
waters
that
it
might
bring
forth
branches
and
that
it
might
bear
fruit
that
it
might
be
a
goodly
vine
say
thou
thus
saith
the
lord
god
shall
it
prosper
shall
he
not
pull
up
the
roots
thereof
and
cut
off
the
fruit
thereof
that
it
wither
it
shall
wither
in
all
the
leaves
of
her
spring
even
without
great
power
or
many
people
to
pluck
it
up
by
the
roots
thereof
yea
behold
being
planted
shall
it
prosper
shall
it
not
utterly
wither
when
the
east
wind
toucheth
it
it
shall
wither
in
the
furrows
where
it
grew
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
say
now
to
the
rebellious
house
know
ye
not
what
these
things
mean
tell
them
behold
the
king
of
babylon
is
come
to
jerusalem
and
hath
taken
the
king
thereof
and
the
princes
thereof
and
led
them
with
him
to
babylon
and
hath
taken
of
the
king's
seed
and
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
hath
taken
an
oath
of
him
he
hath
also
taken
the
mighty
of
the
land
that
the
kingdom
might
be
base
that
it
might
not
lift
itself
up
but
that
by
keeping
of
his
covenant
it
might
stand
but
he
rebelled
against
him
in
sending
his
ambassadors
into
egypt
that
they
might
give
him
horses
and
much
people
shall
he
prosper
shall
he
escape
that
doeth
such
things
or
shall
he
break
the
covenant
and
be
delivered
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
in
the
place
where
the
king
dwelleth
that
made
him
king
whose
oath
he
despised
and
whose
covenant
he
brake
even
with
him
in
the
midst
of
babylon
he
shall
die
neither
shall
pharaoh
with
his
mighty
army
and
great
company
make
for
him
in
the
war
by
casting
up
mounts
and
building
forts
to
cut
off
many
persons
seeing
he
despised
the
oath
by
breaking
the
covenant
when
lo
he
had
given
his
hand
and
hath
done
all
these
things
he
shall
not
escape
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
i
live
surely
mine
oath
that
he
hath
despised
and
my
covenant
that
he
hath
broken
even
it
will
i
recompense
upon
his
own
head
and
i
will
spread
my
net
upon
him
and
he
shall
be
taken
in
my
snare
and
i
will
bring
him
to
babylon
and
will
plead
with
him
there
for
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed
against
me
and
all
his
fugitives
with
all
his
bands
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
they
that
remain
shall
be
scattered
toward
all
winds
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
also
take
of
the
highest
branch
of
the
high
cedar
and
will
set
it
i
will
crop
off
from
the
top
of
his
young
twigs
a
tender
one
and
will
plant
it
upon
an
high
mountain
and
eminent
in
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
israel
will
i
plant
it
and
it
shall
bring
forth
boughs
and
bear
fruit
and
be
a
goodly
cedar
and
under
it
shall
dwell
all
fowl
of
every
wing
in
the
shadow
of
the
branches
thereof
shall
they
dwell
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
brought
down
the
high
tree
have
exalted
the
low
tree
have
dried
up
the
green
tree
and
have
made
the
dry
tree
to
flourish
i
the
lord
have
spoken
and
have
done
it
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
again
saying
what
mean
ye
that
ye
use
this
proverb
concerning
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children's
teeth
are
set
on
edge
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
israel
behold
all
souls
are
mine
as
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
but
if
a
man
be
just
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
and
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
neither
hath
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife
neither
hath
come
near
to
a
menstruous
woman
and
hath
not
oppressed
any
but
hath
restored
to
the
debtor
his
pledge
hath
spoiled
none
by
violence
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment
he
that
hath
not
given
forth
upon
usury
neither
hath
taken
any
increase
that
hath
withdrawn
his
hand
from
iniquity
hath
executed
true
judgment
between
man
and
man
hath
walked
in
my
statutes
and
hath
kept
my
judgments
to
deal
truly
he
is
just
he
shall
surely
live
saith
the
lord
god
if
he
beget
a
son
that
is
a
robber
a
shedder
of
blood
and
that
doeth
the
like
to
any
one
of
these
things
and
that
doeth
not
any
of
those
duties
but
even
hath
eaten
upon
the
mountains
and
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife
hath
oppressed
the
poor
and
needy
hath
spoiled
by
violence
hath
not
restored
the
pledge
and
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
hath
committed
abomination
hath
given
forth
upon
usury
and
hath
taken
increase
shall
he
then
live
he
shall
not
live
he
hath
done
all
these
abominations
he
shall
surely
die
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him
now
lo
if
he
beget
a
son
that
seeth
all
his
father's
sins
which
he
hath
done
and
considereth
and
doeth
not
such
like
that
hath
not
eaten
upon
the
mountains
neither
hath
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
idols
of
the
house
of
israel
hath
not
defiled
his
neighbour's
wife
neither
hath
oppressed
any
hath
not
withholden
the
pledge
neither
hath
spoiled
by
violence
but
hath
given
his
bread
to
the
hungry
and
hath
covered
the
naked
with
a
garment
that
hath
taken
off
his
hand
from
the
poor
that
hath
not
received
usury
nor
increase
hath
executed
my
judgments
hath
walked
in
my
statutes
he
shall
not
die
for
the
iniquity
of
his
father
he
shall
surely
live
as
for
his
father
because
he
cruelly
oppressed
spoiled
his
brother
by
violence
and
did
that
which
is
not
good
among
his
people
lo
even
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
yet
say
ye
why
doth
not
the
son
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father
when
the
son
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
and
hath
kept
all
my
statutes
and
hath
done
them
he
shall
surely
live
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
the
son
shall
not
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father
neither
shall
the
father
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
son
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
be
upon
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
shall
be
upon
him
but
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
and
keep
all
my
statutes
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
they
shall
not
be
mentioned
unto
him
in
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
he
shall
live
have
i
any
pleasure
at
all
that
the
wicked
should
die
saith
the
lord
god
and
not
that
he
should
return
from
his
ways
and
live
but
when
the
righteous
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
and
doeth
according
to
all
the
abominations
that
the
wicked
man
doeth
shall
he
live
all
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
mentioned
in
his
trespass
that
he
hath
trespassed
and
in
his
sin
that
he
hath
sinned
in
them
shall
he
die
yet
ye
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
hear
now
o
house
of
israel
is
not
my
way
equal
are
not
your
ways
unequal
when
a
righteous
man
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
and
dieth
in
them
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
done
shall
he
die
again
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
his
wickedness
that
he
hath
committed
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
save
his
soul
alive
because
he
considereth
and
turneth
away
from
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
yet
saith
the
house
of
israel
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
o
house
of
israel
are
not
my
ways
equal
are
not
your
ways
unequal
therefore
i
will
judge
you
o
house
of
israel
every
one
according
to
his
ways
saith
the
lord
god
repent
and
turn
yourselves
from
all
your
transgressions
so
iniquity
shall
not
be
your
ruin
cast
away
from
you
all
your
transgressions
whereby
ye
have
transgressed
and
make
you
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
for
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
him
that
dieth
saith
the
lord
god
wherefore
turn
yourselves
and
live
ye
moreover
take
thou
up
a
lamentation
for
the
princes
of
israel
and
say
what
is
thy
mother
a
lioness
she
lay
down
among
lions
she
nourished
her
whelps
among
young
lions
and
she
brought
up
one
of
her
whelps
it
became
a
young
lion
and
it
learned
to
catch
the
prey
it
devoured
men
the
nations
also
heard
of
him
he
was
taken
in
their
pit
and
they
brought
him
with
chains
unto
the
land
of
egypt
now
when
she
saw
that
she
had
waited
and
her
hope
was
lost
then
she
took
another
of
her
whelps
and
made
him
a
young
lion
and
he
went
up
and
down
among
the
lions
he
became
a
young
lion
and
learned
to
catch
the
prey
and
devoured
men
and
he
knew
their
desolate
palaces
and
he
laid
waste
their
cities
and
the
land
was
desolate
and
the
fulness
thereof
by
the
noise
of
his
roaring
then
the
nations
set
against
him
on
every
side
from
the
provinces
and
spread
their
net
over
him
he
was
taken
in
their
pit
and
they
put
him
in
ward
in
chains
and
brought
him
to
the
king
of
babylon
they
brought
him
into
holds
that
his
voice
should
no
more
be
heard
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
thy
mother
is
like
a
vine
in
thy
blood
planted
by
the
waters
she
was
fruitful
and
full
of
branches
by
reason
of
many
waters
and
she
had
strong
rods
for
the
sceptres
of
them
that
bare
rule
and
her
stature
was
exalted
among
the
thick
branches
and
she
appeared
in
her
height
with
the
multitude
of
her
branches
but
she
was
plucked
up
in
fury
she
was
cast
down
to
the
ground
and
the
east
wind
dried
up
her
fruit
her
strong
rods
were
broken
and
withered
the
fire
consumed
them
and
now
she
is
planted
in
the
wilderness
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
ground
and
fire
is
gone
out
of
a
rod
of
her
branches
which
hath
devoured
her
fruit
so
that
she
hath
no
strong
rod
to
be
a
sceptre
to
rule
this
is
a
lamentation
and
shall
be
for
a
lamentation
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
in
the
fifth
month
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
that
certain
of
the
elders
of
israel
came
to
enquire
of
the
lord
and
sat
before
me
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
elders
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
are
ye
come
to
enquire
of
me
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you
wilt
thou
judge
them
son
of
man
wilt
thou
judge
them
cause
them
to
know
the
abominations
of
their
fathers
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
when
i
chose
israel
and
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
the
seed
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
made
myself
known
unto
them
in
the
land
of
egypt
when
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
saying
i
am
the
lord
your
god
in
the
day
that
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
to
bring
them
forth
of
the
land
of
egypt
into
a
land
that
i
had
espied
for
them
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands
then
said
i
unto
them
cast
ye
away
every
man
the
abominations
of
his
eyes
and
defile
not
yourselves
with
the
idols
of
egypt
i
am
the
lord
your
god
but
they
rebelled
against
me
and
would
not
hearken
unto
me
they
did
not
every
man
cast
away
the
abominations
of
their
eyes
neither
did
they
forsake
the
idols
of
egypt
then
i
said
i
will
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
i
wrought
for
my
name's
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen
among
whom
they
were
in
whose
sight
i
made
myself
known
unto
them
in
bringing
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
wherefore
i
caused
them
to
go
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
brought
them
into
the
wilderness
and
i
gave
them
my
statutes
and
shewed
them
my
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
moreover
also
i
gave
them
my
sabbaths
to
be
a
sign
between
me
and
them
that
they
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
sanctify
them
but
the
house
of
israel
rebelled
against
me
in
the
wilderness
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes
and
they
despised
my
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
and
my
sabbaths
they
greatly
polluted
then
i
said
i
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
in
the
wilderness
to
consume
them
but
i
wrought
for
my
name's
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
before
the
heathen
in
whose
sight
i
brought
them
out
yet
also
i
lifted
up
my
hand
unto
them
in
the
wilderness
that
i
would
not
bring
them
into
the
land
which
i
had
given
them
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
which
is
the
glory
of
all
lands
because
they
despised
my
judgments
and
walked
not
in
my
statutes
but
polluted
my
sabbaths
for
their
heart
went
after
their
idols
nevertheless
mine
eye
spared
them
from
destroying
them
neither
did
i
make
an
end
of
them
in
the
wilderness
but
i
said
unto
their
children
in
the
wilderness
walk
ye
not
in
the
statutes
of
your
fathers
neither
observe
their
judgments
nor
defile
yourselves
with
their
idols
i
am
the
lord
your
god
walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
my
judgments
and
do
them
and
hallow
my
sabbaths
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
between
me
and
you
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
notwithstanding
the
children
rebelled
against
me
they
walked
not
in
my
statutes
neither
kept
my
judgments
to
do
them
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
even
live
in
them
they
polluted
my
sabbaths
then
i
said
i
would
pour
out
my
fury
upon
them
to
accomplish
my
anger
against
them
in
the
wilderness
nevertheless
i
withdrew
mine
hand
and
wrought
for
my
name's
sake
that
it
should
not
be
polluted
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
in
whose
sight
i
brought
them
forth
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
unto
them
also
in
the
wilderness
that
i
would
scatter
them
among
the
heathen
and
disperse
them
through
the
countries
because
they
had
not
executed
my
judgments
but
had
despised
my
statutes
and
had
polluted
my
sabbaths
and
their
eyes
were
after
their
fathers
idols
wherefore
i
gave
them
also
statutes
that
were
not
good
and
judgments
whereby
they
should
not
live
and
i
polluted
them
in
their
own
gifts
in
that
they
caused
to
pass
through
the
fire
all
that
openeth
the
womb
that
i
might
make
them
desolate
to
the
end
that
they
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
therefore
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
yet
in
this
your
fathers
have
blasphemed
me
in
that
they
have
committed
a
trespass
against
me
for
when
i
had
brought
them
into
the
land
for
the
which
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
them
then
they
saw
every
high
hill
and
all
the
thick
trees
and
they
offered
there
their
sacrifices
and
there
they
presented
the
provocation
of
their
offering
there
also
they
made
their
sweet
savour
and
poured
out
there
their
drink
offerings
then
i
said
unto
them
what
is
the
high
place
whereunto
ye
go
and
the
name
whereof
is
called
bamah
unto
this
day
wherefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
are
ye
polluted
after
the
manner
of
your
fathers
and
commit
ye
whoredom
after
their
abominations
for
when
ye
offer
your
gifts
when
ye
make
your
sons
to
pass
through
the
fire
ye
pollute
yourselves
with
all
your
idols
even
unto
this
day
and
shall
i
be
enquired
of
by
you
o
house
of
israel
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
not
be
enquired
of
by
you
and
that
which
cometh
into
your
mind
shall
not
be
at
all
that
ye
say
we
will
be
as
the
heathen
as
the
families
of
the
countries
to
serve
wood
and
stone
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
will
i
rule
over
you
and
i
will
bring
you
out
from
the
people
and
will
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
are
scattered
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
a
stretched
out
arm
and
with
fury
poured
out
and
i
will
bring
you
into
the
wilderness
of
the
people
and
there
will
i
plead
with
you
face
to
face
like
as
i
pleaded
with
your
fathers
in
the
wilderness
of
the
land
of
egypt
so
will
i
plead
with
you
saith
the
lord
god
and
i
will
cause
you
to
pass
under
the
rod
and
i
will
bring
you
into
the
bond
of
the
covenant
and
i
will
purge
out
from
among
you
the
rebels
and
them
that
transgress
against
me
i
will
bring
them
forth
out
of
the
country
where
they
sojourn
and
they
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
as
for
you
o
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
go
ye
serve
ye
every
one
his
idols
and
hereafter
also
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
me
but
pollute
ye
my
holy
name
no
more
with
your
gifts
and
with
your
idols
for
in
mine
holy
mountain
in
the
mountain
of
the
height
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
all
the
house
of
israel
all
of
them
in
the
land
serve
me
there
will
i
accept
them
and
there
will
i
require
your
offerings
and
the
firstfruits
of
your
oblations
with
all
your
holy
things
i
will
accept
you
with
your
sweet
savour
when
i
bring
you
out
from
the
people
and
gather
you
out
of
the
countries
wherein
ye
have
been
scattered
and
i
will
be
sanctified
in
you
before
the
heathen
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
bring
you
into
the
land
of
israel
into
the
country
for
the
which
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
to
your
fathers
and
there
shall
ye
remember
your
ways
and
all
your
doings
wherein
ye
have
been
defiled
and
ye
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
all
your
evils
that
ye
have
committed
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
wrought
with
you
for
my
name's
sake
not
according
to
your
wicked
ways
nor
according
to
your
corrupt
doings
o
ye
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
set
thy
face
toward
the
south
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
south
and
prophesy
against
the
forest
of
the
south
field
and
say
to
the
forest
of
the
south
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
kindle
a
fire
in
thee
and
it
shall
devour
every
green
tree
in
thee
and
every
dry
tree
the
flaming
flame
shall
not
be
quenched
and
all
faces
from
the
south
to
the
north
shall
be
burned
therein
and
all
flesh
shall
see
that
i
the
lord
have
kindled
it
it
shall
not
be
quenched
then
said
i
ah

god
they
say
of
me
doth
he
not
speak
parables
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying

thy
face
toward
jerusalem
and
drop
thy
word
toward
the
holy
places
and
prophesy
against

land
of
israel
and
say
to
the
land
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
am
against
thee
and
will
draw
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath
and
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
seeing
then
that
i
will
cut
off
from
thee
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
therefore
shall
my
sword
go
forth
out
of
his
sheath
against
all
flesh
from
the
south
to
the
north
that
all
flesh
may
know
that

the
lord
have
drawn
forth
my
sword
out
of
his
sheath
it
shall
not
return
any
more
sigh
therefore
thou
son
of
man
with
the
breaking
of
thy
loins
and
with
bitterness
sigh
before
their
eyes
and
it
shall
be
when
they
say
unto
thee
wherefore
sighest
thou
that
thou
shalt
answer
for
the
tidings
because
it
cometh
and
every
heart
shall
melt
and
all
hands
shall
be
feeble
and
every
spirit
shall
faint
and
all
knees
shall
be
weak
as

it
cometh
and
shall
be
brought
to
pass
saith
the
lord
god
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying

thigh
because

is
a
trial
and
what
if

into
their
privy
chambers
i
have
set
the
point
of
the
sword
against
all
their
gates
that

ruins
be
multiplied
ah

i
the
lord
have
said
it
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
again
saying
also
thou
son
of
man
appoint
thee
two
ways
that
the
sword
of
the
king
of
babylon
may
come
both
twain

come
forth
out
of
one
land
and
choose
thou
a
place

it
at
the
head
of
the
way
to
the
city
appoint
a
way
that
the
sword
may
come
to
rabbath
of
the
ammonites
and
to
judah
in
jerusalem
the
defenced
for
the
king
of
babylon
stood
at
the
parting
of
the
way
at
the
head
of
the
two
ways
to
use
divination
he
made
his
arrows
bright
he
consulted
with
images
he
looked
in
the
liver
at
his
right
hand
was
the
divination
for
jerusalem
to
appoint
captains
to
open
the
mouth
in
the
slaughter
to
lift
up
the
voice
with
shouting
to
appoint
battering
rams
against
the
gates
to
cast
a
mount
and
to
build
a
fort
and
it
shall
be
unto
them
as
a
false
divination
in
their
sight
to
them
that
have
sworn
oaths
but
he
will
call
to
remembrance
the
iniquity
that
they
may
be
taken
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
have
made
your
iniquity
to
be
remembered
in
that
your
transgressions
are
discovered
so
that
in
all
your
doings
your
sins
do
appear
because
i
say
that
ye
are

shall
be
taken
with
the
hand
and
thou
profane
wicked
prince
of
israel

shall
have
an
end

the
diadem
and
take
off
the
crown

shall
not
be
the
same

him
that
is

him
that
is
high

will
overturn

it
and
it
shall
be
no
more
until
he
come
whose
right
it
is
and
i
will
give
it
him
and
thou
son
of
man

the
lord
god
concerning
the
ammonites
and
concerning
their
reproach
even
say
thou
the
sword
the
sword
is
drawn
for
the
slaughter

is
furbished
to
consume
because
of
the
glittering
whiles
they
see
vanity
unto
thee
whiles
they
divine
a
lie
unto
thee
to
bring
thee
upon
the
necks
of
them
that
are
slain
of
the
wicked
whose
day
is
come
when
their
iniquity
shall
have
an
end

i
cause
it
to
return
into
his
sheath

thee
in
the
place
where
thou
wast
created
in
the
land
of
thy
nativity
and
i
will
pour
out
mine
indignation
upon
thee

will
blow
against
thee
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath
and
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
brutish
men
and

shalt
be
for
fuel
to
the
fire

shalt
be
no
more
remembered
for

spoken
it
moreover
the
word
of

unto
me
saying

thou
judge
the
bloody
city
yea
thou
shalt
shew
her
all
her
abominations
then
say
thou
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
city
sheddeth
blood
in
the
midst
of
it
that
her
time
may
come
and
maketh
idols
against
herself
to
defile
herself
thou
art
become
guilty
in
thy
blood
that
thou
hast
shed
and
hast
defiled
thyself
in
thine
idols
which
thou
hast
made
and
thou
hast
caused
thy
days
to
draw
near
and
art
come
even
unto
thy
years
therefore
have
i
made
thee
a
reproach
unto
the
heathen
and
a
mocking
to
all
countries
those
that
be
near
and
those
that
be
far
from
thee
shall
mock
thee
which
art
infamous
and
much
vexed
behold
the
princes
of
israel
every
one
were
in
thee
to
their
power
to
shed
blood
in
thee
have
they
set
light
by
father
and
mother
in
the
midst
of
thee
have
they
dealt
by
oppression
with
the
stranger
in
thee
have
they
vexed
the
fatherless
and
the
widow

hast
despised
mine
holy
things
and

tales
to
shed
blood
and
in
thee
they
eat
upon
the
mountains
in
the
midst
of
thee
they
commit
lewdness
in
thee
have
they
discovered
their
fathers
nakedness
in
thee
have
they
humbled
her
that
was
set
apart
for
pollution
and
one
hath
committed
abomination
with
his
neighbour's
wife
and
another
hath
lewdly
defiled
his
daughter
in
law
and
another
in
thee
hath
humbled

sister
his
father's
daughter
in
thee
have
they
taken
gifts
to
shed
blood
thou
hast
taken
usury
and
increase
and
thou
hast
greedily
gained
of
thy
neighbours
by
extortion
and
hast
forgotten
me
saith
the
lord
god
behold
therefore
i
have
smitten
mine
hand
at
thy
dishonest
gain
which
thou
hast
made
and
at
thy
blood
which
hath
been
in
the
midst
of
thee
can
thine
heart
endure
or
can
thine
hands
be
strong
in
the
days
that
i
shall
deal
with
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
will
do
it
and
i
will
scatter
thee
among
the
heathen
and
disperse
thee
in
the
countries
and
will
consume
thy
filthiness
out
of
thee
and
thou
shalt
take
thine
inheritance
in
thyself
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
the
house
of
israel
is
to
me
become
dross
all
they
are
brass
and
tin
and
iron
and
lead
in
the
midst
of

furnace
they
are
even
the
dross
of

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
ye
are
all
become
dross
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
you
into
the
midst
of
jerusalem
as
they
gather
silver
and
brass
and
iron
and
lead
and
tin
into
the
midst
of
the
furnace
to
blow
the
fire
upon
it
to
melt
it
so
will
i
gather
you
in
mine
anger
and
in
my
fury
and
i
will
leave
you
there
and
melt
you
yea
i
will
gather
you
and
blow
upon
you
in
the
fire
of
my
wrath
and
ye
shall
be
melted
in
the
midst
therof
as
silver
is
melted
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace
so
shall
ye
be
melted
in
the
midst
thereof
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
have
poured
out
my
fury
upon
you
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
say
unto
her
thou
art
the
land
that
is
not
cleansed
nor
rained
upon
in
the
day
of
indignation
there
is
a
conspiracy
of
her
prophets
in
the
midst
thereof
like
a
roaring
lion
ravening
the
prey
they
have
devoured
souls
they
have
taken
the
treasure
and
precious
things
they
have
made
her
many
widows
in
the
midst
thereof
her
priests
have
violated
my
law
and
have
profaned
mine
holy
things
they
have
put
no
difference
between
the
holy
and
profane
neither
have
they
shewed
difference
between
the
unclean
and
the
clean
and
have
hid
their
eyes
from
my
sabbaths
and
i
am
profaned
among
them
her
princes
in
the
midst
thereof
are
like
wolves
ravening
the
prey
to
shed
blood
and
to
destroy
souls
to
get
dishonest
gain
and
her
prophets
have
daubed
them
with
untempered
morter
seeing
vanity
and
divining
lies
unto
them
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
the
people
of
the
land
have
used
oppression
and
exercised
robbery
and
have
vexed
the
poor
and
needy
yea
they
have
oppressed
the
stranger
wrongfully
and
i
sought
for
a
man
among
them
that
should
make
up
the
hedge
and
stand
in
the
gap
before
me
for
the
land
that
i
should
not
destroy
it
but
i
found
none
therefore
have
i
poured
out
mine
indignation
upon
them
i
have
consumed
them
with
the
fire
of
my
wrath
their
own
way
have
i
recompensed
upon
their
heads
saith
the
lord
god
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
there
were
two
women
the
daughters
of
one
mother
and
they
committed
whoredoms
in
egypt
they
committed
whoredoms
in
their
youth
there
were
their
breasts
pressed
and
there
they
bruised
the
teats
of
their
virginity
and
the
names
of
them
were
aholah
the
elder
and
aholibah
her
sister
and
they
were
mine
and
they
bare
sons
and
daughters
thus
were
their
names

aholah
and
jerusalem
aholibah
and
aholah
played
the
harlot
when
she
was
mine
and
she
doted
on
her
lovers
on
the
assyrians
her
neighbours
which
were
clothed
with
blue
captains
and
rulers
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
thus
she
committed
her
whoredoms
with
them
with
all
them
that
were
the
chosen
men
of
assyria
and
with
all
on
whom
she
doted
with
all
their
idols
she
defiled
herself
neither
left
she
her
whoredoms
brought
from
egypt
for
in
her
youth
they
lay
with
her
and
they
bruised
the
breasts
of
her
virginity
and
poured
their
whoredom
upon
her
wherefore
i
have
delivered
her
into
the
hand
of
her
lovers
into
the
hand
of
the
assyrians
upon
whom
she
doted
these
discovered
her
nakedness
they
took
her
sons
and
her
daughters
and
slew
her
with
the
sword
and
she
became
famous
among
women
for
they
had
executed
judgment
upon
her
and
when
her
sister
aholibah
saw
this
she
was
more
corrupt
in
her
inordinate
love
than
she
and
in
her
whoredoms
more
than
her
sister
in
her
whoredoms
she
doted
upon
the
assyrians
her
neighbours
captains
and
rulers
clothed
most
gorgeously
horsemen
riding
upon
horses
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
then
i
saw
that
she
was
defiled
that
they
took
both
one
way
and
that
she
increased
her
whoredoms
for
when
she
saw
men
pourtrayed
upon
the
wall
the
images
of
the
chaldeans
pourtrayed
with
vermilion
girded
with
girdles
upon
their
loins
exceeding
in
dyed
attire
upon
their
heads
all
of
them
princes
to
look
to
after
the
manner
of
the
babylonians
of
chaldea
the
land
of
their
nativity
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
with
her
eyes
she
doted
upon
them
and
sent
messengers
unto
them
into
chaldea
and
the
babylonians
came
to
her
into
the
bed
of
love
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
whoredom
and
she
was
polluted
with
them
and
her
mind
was
alienated
from
them
so
she
discovered
her
whoredoms
and
discovered
her
nakedness
then
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her
like
as
my
mind
was
alienated
from
her
sister
yet
she
multiplied
her
whoredoms
in
calling
to
remembrance
the
days
of
her
youth
wherein
she
had
played
the
harlot
in
the
land
of
egypt
for
she
doted
upon
their
paramours
whose
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
asses
and
whose
issue
is
like
the
issue
of
horses
thus
thou
calledst
to
remembrance
the
lewdness
of
thy
youth
in
bruising
thy
teats
by
the
egyptians
for
the
paps
of
thy
youth
therefore
o
aholibah
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
raise
up
thy
lovers
against
thee
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated
and
i
will
bring
them
against
thee
on
every
side
the
babylonians
and
all
the
chaldeans
pekod
and
shoa
and
koa
and
all
the
assyrians
with
them
all
of
them
desirable
young
men
captains
and
rulers
great
lords
and
renowned
all
of
them
riding
upon
horses
and
they
shall
come
against
thee
with
chariots
wagons
and
wheels
and
with
an
assembly
of
people
which
shall
set
against
thee
buckler
and
shield
and
helmet
round
about
and
i
will
set
judgment
before
them
and
they
shall
judge
thee
according
to
their
judgments
and
i
will
set
my
jealousy
against
thee
and
they
shall
deal
furiously
with
thee
they
shall
take
away
thy
nose
and
thine
ears
and
thy
remnant
shall
fall
by
the
sword
they
shall
take
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
and
thy
residue
shall
be
devoured
by
the
fire
they
shall
also
strip
thee
out
of
thy
clothes
and
take
away
thy
fair
jewels
thus
will
i
make
thy
lewdness
to
cease
from
thee
and
thy
whoredom
brought
from
the
land
of
egypt
so
that
thou
shalt
not
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
them
nor
remember
egypt
any
more
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
them
whom
thou
hatest
into
the
hand
of
them
from
whom
thy
mind
is
alienated
and
they
shall
deal
with
thee
hatefully
and
shall
take
away
all
thy
labour
and
shall
leave
thee
naked
and
bare
and
the
nakedness
of
thy
whoredoms
shall
be
discovered
both
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
i
will
do
these
things
unto
thee
because
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
after
the
heathen
and
because
thou
art
polluted
with
their
idols
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
thy
sister
therefore
will
i
give
her
cup
into
thine
hand
thus
saith
the
lord
god
thou
shalt
drink
of
thy
sister's
cup
deep
and
large
thou
shalt
be
laughed
to
scorn
and
had
in
derision
it
containeth
much
thou
shalt
be
filled
with
drunkenness
and
sorrow
with
the
cup
of
astonishment
and
desolation
with
the
cup
of
thy
sister
samaria
thou
shalt
even
drink
it
and
suck
it
out
and
thou
shalt
break
the
sherds
thereof
and
pluck
off
thine
own
breasts
for
i
have
spoken
it
saith
the
lord
god
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
forgotten
me
and
cast
me
behind
thy
back
therefore
bear
thou
also
thy
lewdness
and
thy
whoredoms
the
lord
said
moreover
unto
me
son
of
man
wilt
thou
judge
aholah
and
aholibah
yea
declare
unto
them
their
abominations
that
they
have
committed
adultery
and
blood
is
in
their
hands
and
with
their
idols
have
they
committed
adultery
and
have
also
caused
their
sons
whom
they
bare
unto
me
to
pass
for
them
through
the
fire
to
devour
them
moreover
this
they
have
done
unto
me
they
have
defiled
my
sanctuary
in
the
same
day
and
have
profaned
my
sabbaths
for
when
they
had
slain
their
children
to
their
idols
then
they
came
the
same
day
into
my
sanctuary
to
profane
it
and
lo
thus
have
they
done
in
the
midst
of
mine
house
and
furthermore
that
ye
have
sent
for
men
to
come
from
far
unto
whom
a
messenger
was
sent
and
lo
they
came
for
whom
thou
didst
wash
thyself
paintedst
thy
eyes
and
deckedst
thyself
with
ornaments
and
satest
upon
a
stately
bed
and
a
table
prepared
before
it
whereupon
thou
hast
set
mine
incense
and
mine
oil
and
a
voice
of
a
multitude
being
at
ease
was
with
her
and
with
the
men
of
the
common
sort
were
brought
sabeans
from
the
wilderness
which
put
bracelets
upon
their
hands
and
beautiful
crowns
upon
their
heads
then
said
i
unto
her
that
was
old
in
adulteries
will
they
now
commit
whoredoms
with
her
and
she
with
them
yet
they
went
in
unto
her
as
they
go
in
unto
a
woman
that
playeth
the
harlot
so
went
they
in
unto
aholah
and
unto
aholibah
the
lewd
women
and
the
righteous
men
they
shall
judge
them
after
the
manner
of
adulteresses
and
after
the
manner
of
women
that
shed
blood
because
they
are
adulteresses
and
blood
is
in
their
hands
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
bring
up
a
company
upon
them
and
will
give
them
to
be
removed
and
spoiled
and
the
company
shall
stone
them
with
stones
and
dispatch
them
with
their
swords
they
shall
slay
their
sons
and
their
daughters
and
burn
up
their
houses
with
fire
thus
will
i
cause
lewdness
to
cease
out
of
the
land
that
all
women
may
be
taught
not
to
do
after
your
lewdness
and
they
shall
recompense
your
lewdness
upon
you
and
ye
shall
bear
the
sins
of
your
idols
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
again
in
the
ninth
year
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
write
thee
the
name
of
the
day
even
of
this
same
day
the
king
of
babylon
set
himself
against
jerusalem
this
same
day
and
utter
a
parable
unto
the
rebellious
house
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
set
on
a
pot
set
it
on
and
also
pour
water
into
it
gather
the
pieces
thereof
into
it
even
every
good
piece
the
thigh
and
the
shoulder
fill
it
with
the
choice
bones
take
the
choice
of
the
flock
and
burn
also
the
bones
under
it
and
make
it
boil
well
and
let
them
seethe
the
bones
of
it
therein
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
bloody
city
to
the
pot
whose
scum
is
therein
and
whose
scum
is
not
gone
out
of
it
bring
it
out
piece
by
piece
let
no
lot
fall
upon
it
for
her
blood
is
in
the
midst
of
her
she
set
it
upon
the
top
of
a
rock
she
poured
it
not
upon
the
ground
to
cover
it
with
dust
that
it
might
cause
fury
to
come
up
to
take
vengeance
i
have
set
her
blood
upon
the
top
of
a
rock
that
it
should
not
be
covered
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
woe
to
the
bloody
city
i
will
even
make
the
pile
for
fire
great
heap
on
wood
kindle
the
fire
consume
the
flesh
and
spice
it
well
and
let
the
bones
be
burned
then
set
it
empty
upon
the
coals
thereof
that
the
brass
of
it
may
be
hot
and
may
burn
and
that
the
filthiness
of
it
may
be
molten
in
it
that
the
scum
of
it
may
be
consumed
she
hath
wearied
herself
with
lies
and
her
great
scum
went
not
forth
out
of
her
her
scum
shall
be
in
the
fire
in
thy
filthiness
is
lewdness
because
i
have
purged
thee
and
thou
wast
not
purged
thou
shalt
not
be
purged
from
thy
filthiness
any
more
till
i
have
caused
my
fury
to
rest
upon
thee
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
it
shall
come
to
pass
and
i
will
do
it
i
will
not
go
back
neither
will
i
spare
neither
will
i
repent
according
to
thy
ways
and
according
to
thy
doings
shall
they
judge
thee
saith
the
lord
god
also
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
behold
i
take
away
from
thee
the
desire
of
thine
eyes
with
a
stroke
yet
neither
shalt
thou
mourn
nor
weep
neither
shall
thy
tears
run
down
forbear
to
cry
make
no
mourning
for
the
dead
bind
the
tire
of
thine
head
upon
thee
and
put
on
thy
shoes
upon
thy
feet
and
cover
not
thy
lips
and
eat
not
the
bread
of
men
so
i
spake
unto
the
people
in
the
morning
and
at
even
my
wife
died
and
i
did
in
the
morning
as
i
was
commanded
and
the
people
said
unto
me
wilt
thou
not
tell
us
what
these
things
are
to
us
that
thou
doest
so
then
i
answered
them
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
profane
my
sanctuary
the
excellency
of
your
strength
the
desire
of
your
eyes
and
that
which
your
soul
pitieth
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
ye
have
left
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
ye
shall
do
as
i
have
done
ye
shall
not
cover
your
lips
nor
eat
the
bread
of
men
and
your
tires
shall
be
upon
your
heads
and
your
shoes
upon
your
feet
ye
shall
not
mourn
nor
weep
but
ye
shall
pine
away
for
your
iniquities
and
mourn
one
toward
another
thus
ezekiel
is
unto
you
a
sign
according
to
all
that
he
hath
done
shall
ye
do
and
when
this
cometh
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
god
also
thou
son
of
man
shall
it
not
be
in
the
day
when
i
take
from
them
their
strength
the
joy
of
their
glory
the
desire
of
their
eyes
and
that
whereupon
they
set
their
minds
their
sons
and
their
daughters
that
he
that
escapeth
in
that
day
shall
come
unto
thee
to
cause
thee
to
hear
it
with
thine
ears
in
that
day
shall
thy
mouth
be
opened
to
him
which
is
escaped
and
thou
shalt
speak
and
be
no
more
dumb
and
thou
shalt
be
a
sign
unto
them
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
the
word
of
the
lord
came
again
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
the
ammonites
and
prophesy
against
them
and
say
unto
the
ammonites
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
saidst
aha
against
my
sanctuary
when
it
was
profaned
and
against
the
land
of
israel
when
it
was
desolate
and
against
the
house
of
judah
when
they
went
into
captivity
behold
therefore
i
will
deliver
thee
to
the
men
of
the
east
for
a
possession
and
they
shall
set
their
palaces
in
thee
and
make
their
dwellings
in
thee
they
shall
eat
thy
fruit
and
they
shall
drink
thy
milk
and
i
will
make
rabbah
a
stable
for
camels
and
the
ammonites
a
couching
place
for
flocks
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
clapped
thine
hands
and
stamped
with
the
feet
and
rejoiced
in
heart
with
all
thy
despite
against
the
land
of
israel
behold
therefore
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
thee
and
will
deliver
thee
for
a
spoil
to
the
heathen
and
i
will
cut
thee
off
from
the
people
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
perish
out
of
the
countries
i
will
destroy
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
that
moab
and
seir
do
say
behold
the
house
of
judah
is
like
unto
all
the
heathen
therefore
behold
i
will
open
the
side
of
moab
from
the
cities
from
his
cities
which
are
on
his
frontiers
the
glory
of
the
country
bethjeshimoth
baalmeon
and
kiriathaim
unto
the
men
of
the
east
with
the
ammonites
and
will
give
them
in
possession
that
the
ammonites
may
not
be
remembered
among
the
nations
and
i
will
execute
judgments
upon
moab
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
that
edom
hath
dealt
against
the
house
of
judah
by
taking
vengeance
and
hath
greatly
offended
and
revenged
himself
upon
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
also
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
edom
and
will
cut
off
man
and
beast
from
it
and
i
will
make
it
desolate
from
teman
and
they
of
dedan
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
i
will
lay
my
vengeance
upon
edom
by
the
hand
of
my
people
israel
and
they
shall
do
in
edom
according
to
mine
anger
and
according
to
my
fury
and
they
shall
know
my
vengeance
saith
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
the
philistines
have
dealt
by
revenge
and
have
taken
vengeance
with
a
despiteful
heart
to
destroy
it
for
the
old
hatred
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
upon
the
philistines
and
i
will
cut
off
the
cherethims
and
destroy
the
remnant
of
the
sea
coast
and
i
will
execute
great
vengeance
upon
them
with
furious
rebukes
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
lay
my
vengeance
upon
them
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
because
that
tyrus
hath
said
against
jerusalem
aha
she
is
broken
that
was
the
gates
of
the
people
she
is
turned
unto
me
i
shall
be
replenished
now
she
is
laid
waste
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
thee
o
tyrus
and
will
cause
many
nations
to
come
up
against
thee
as
the
sea
causeth
his
waves
to
come
up
and
they
shall
destroy
the
walls
of
tyrus
and
break
down
her
towers
i
will
also
scrape
her
dust
from
her
and
make
her
like
the
top
of
a
rock
it
shall
be
a
place
for
the
spreading
of
nets
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
for
i
have

thus
saith
the
lord
god
at
the
end
of
forty
years
will
i
gather
the
egyptians
from
the

whither
they
were

and
they
shall

there
a
base
kingdom
it
shall
be
the
basest
of
the
kingdoms
neither
shall
it
exalt
itself
any
more
above
the
nations
for
i
will
diminish
them
that
they
shall
no
more
rule
over
the
nations
and
it
shall
be
no
more
the
confidence
of
the
house
of
israel
which
bringeth
their
iniquity
to

when
they
shall
look
after
them
but
they
shall

was
peeled
yet
had
he
no
wages
nor
his
army
for
tyrus
for
the
service
that
he
had
served
against
it
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
give
the
land
of
egypt
unto
nebuchadrezzar
king
of
babylon
and
he
shall
take

and
it
shall
be
the
wages
for
his
army
i
have
given
him
the
land
of

for
his
labour
wherewith
he
served
against
it
because
they
wrought
for
me
saith
the

i
cause

of

of

forth
and
i

have
set
a
fire
in

and
when
all
her
helpers
shall
be
destroyed
in

king
of

and
will
break
his
arms
the
strong
and
that
which

hand
but
i
will
break
pharaoh's
arms
and
he
shall
groan
before
him
with
the
groanings
of
a
deadly
wounded
man
but
i
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
the
arms
of
pharaoh
shall
fall
down
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
shall
put
my
sword
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of

and
he
shall
stretch
it
out
upon
the
land
of

and
i
will
scatter
the
egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
countries
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
in
the
third
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
speak
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
to
his
multitude
whom
art
thou
like
in
thy
greatness
behold
the
assyrian
was
a
cedar
in
lebanon
with
fair
branches
and
with
a
shadowing
shroud
and
of
an
high
stature
and
his
top
was
among
the
thick
boughs
the
waters
made
him
great
the
deep
set
him
up
on
high
with
her
rivers
running
round
about
his
plants
and
sent
her
little
rivers
unto
all
the
trees
of
the
field
therefore
his
height
was
exalted
above
all
the
trees
of
the
field
and
his
boughs
were
multiplied
and
his
branches
became
long
because
of
the
multitude
of
waters
when
he
shot
forth
all
the
fowls
of
heaven
made
their
nests
in
his
boughs
and
under
his
branches
did
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
bring
forth
their
young
and
under
his
shadow
dwelt
all
great
nations
thus
was
he
fair
in
his
greatness
in
the
length
of
his
branches
for
his
root
was
by
great
waters
the
cedars
in
the
garden
of
god
could
not
hide
him
the
fir
trees
were
not
like
his
boughs
and
the
chestnut
trees
were
not
like
his
branches
nor
any
tree
in
the
garden
of
god
was
like
unto
him
in
his
beauty
i
have
made
him
fair
by
the
multitude
of
his
branches
so
that
all
the
trees
of
eden
that
were
in
the
garden
of
god
envied
him
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
thou
hast
lifted
up
thyself
in
height
and
he
hath
shot
up
his
top
among
the
thick
boughs
and
his
heart
is
lifted
up
in
his
height
i
have
therefore
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
mighty
one
of
the
heathen
he
shall
surely
deal
with
him
i
have
driven
him
out
for
his
wickedness
and
strangers
the
terrible
of
the
nations
have
cut
him
off
and
have
left
him
upon
the
mountains
and
in
all
the
valleys
his
branches
are
fallen
and
his
boughs
are
broken
by
all
the
rivers
of
the
land
and
all
the
people
of
the
earth
are
gone
down
from
his
shadow
and
have
left
him
upon
his
ruin
shall
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
remain
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
upon
his
branches
to
the
end
that
none
of
all
the
trees
by
the
waters
exalt
themselves
for
their
height
neither
shoot
up
their
top
among
the
thick
boughs
neither
their
trees
stand
up
in
their
height
all
that
drink
water
for
they
are
all
delivered
unto
death
to
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
men
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
when
he
went
down
to
the
grave
i
caused
a
mourning
i
covered
the
deep
for
him
and
i
restrained
the
floods
thereof
and
the
great
waters
were
stayed
and
i
caused
lebanon
to
mourn
for
him
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
fainted
for
him
i
made
the
nations
to
shake
at
the
sound
of
his
fall
when
i
cast
him
down
to
hell
with
them
that
descend
into
the
pit
and
all
the
trees
of
eden
the
choice
and
best
of
lebanon
all
that
drink
water
shall
be
comforted
in
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
they
also
went
down
into
hell
with
him
unto
them
that
be
slain
with
the
sword
and
they
that
were
his
arm
that
dwelt
under
his
shadow
in
the
midst
of
the
heathen
to
whom
art
thou
thus
like
in
glory
and
in
greatness
among
the
trees
of
eden
yet
shalt
thou
be
brought
down
with
the
trees
of
eden
unto
the
nether
parts
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword
this
is
pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude
saith
the
lord
god
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
in
the
twelfth
month
in
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
take
up
a
lamentation
for
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
say
unto
him
thou
art
like
a
young
lion
of
the
nations
and
thou
art
as
a
whale
in
the
seas
and
thou
camest
forth
with
thy
rivers
and
troubledst
the
waters
with
thy
feet
and
fouledst
their
rivers
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
therefore
spread
out
my
net
over
thee
with
a
company
of
many
people
and
they
shall
bring
thee
up
in
my
net
then
will
i
leave
thee
upon
the
land
i
will
cast
thee
forth
upon
the
open
field
and
will
cause
all
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
to
remain
upon
thee
and
i
will
fill
the
beasts
of
the
whole
earth
with
thee
and
i
will
lay
thy
flesh
upon
the
mountains
and
fill
the
valleys
with
thy
height
i
will
also
water
with
thy
blood
the
land
wherein
thou
swimmest
even
to
the
mountains
and
the
rivers
shall
be
full
of
thee
and
when
i
shall
put
thee
out
i
will
cover
the
heaven
and
make
the
stars
thereof
dark
i
will
cover
the
sun
with
a
cloud
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
all
the
bright
lights
of
heaven
will
i
make
dark
over
thee
and
set
darkness
upon
thy
land
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
also
vex
the
hearts
of
many
people
when
i
shall
bring
thy
destruction
among
the
nations
into
the
countries
which
thou
hast
not
known
yea
i
will
make
many
people
amazed
at
thee
and
their
kings
shall
be
horribly
afraid
for
thee
when
i
shall
brandish
my
sword
before
them
and
they
shall
tremble
at
every
moment
every
man
for
his

neither
shall
the
foot
of
man
trouble
them
any
more
nor

hoofs
of

trouble
them
then
will
i
make
their
waters
deep
and
cause
their
rivers
to
run
like

saith
the
lord
god
when
i
shall
make
the
land
of

be
destitute
of

by

they
shall
lie
with

uncircumcised
and
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
there
be
the
princes
of
the
north
all
of

and
all
the
zidonians
which
are
gone
down
with

they
are

they
lie
uncircumcised
with
them
that
be
slain
by
the
sword
and
bear
their
shame
with
them
that
go
down
to
the
pit
pharaoh
shall
see
them
and
shall
be
comforted
over
all
his
multitude
even
pharaoh
and
all
his
army
slain
by
the
sword
saith
the
lord
god
for
i
have
caused
my
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
he
shall
be
laid
in
the
midst
of
the
uncircumcised
with
them
that
are
slain
with
the
sword
even
pharaoh
and
all
his
multitude
saith
the
lord
god
again
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
speak
to
the
children
of
thy
people
and
say
unto
them
when
i
bring
the
sword
upon
a
land
if
the
people
of
the
land
take
a
man
of
their
coasts
and
set
him
for
their
watchman
if
when
he
seeth
the
sword
come
upon
the
land
he
blow
the
trumpet
and
warn
the
people
then
whosoever
heareth
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
taketh
not
warning
if
the
sword
come
and
take
him
away
his
blood
shall
be
upon
his
own
head
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
took
not
warning
his
blood
shall
be
upon
him
but
he
that
taketh
warning
shall
deliver
his
soul
but
if
the
watchman
see
the
sword
come
and
blow
not
the
trumpet
and
the
people
be
not
warned
if
the
sword
come
and
take
any
person
from
among
them
he
is
taken
away
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
the
watchman's
hand
so
thou
o
son
of
man
i
have
set
thee
a
watchman
unto
the
house
of
israel
therefore
thou
shalt
hear
the
word
at
my
mouth
and
warn
them
from
me
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
o
wicked
man
thou
shalt
surely
die
if
thou
dost
not
speak
to
warn
the
wicked
from
his
way
that
wicked
man
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
his
blood
will
i
require
at
thine
hand
nevertheless
if
thou
warn
the
wicked
of
his
way
to
turn
from
it
if
he
do
not
turn
from
his
way
he
shall
die
in
his
iniquity
but
thou
hast
delivered
thy
soul
therefore
o
thou
son
of
man
speak
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
ye
speak
saying
if
our
transgressions
and
our
sins
be
upon
us
and
we
pine
away
in
them
how
should
we
then
live
say
unto
them
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
have
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
the
wicked
but
that
the
wicked
turn
from
his
way
and
live
turn
ye
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways
for
why
will
ye
die
o
house
of
israel
therefore
thou
son
of
man
say
unto
the
children
of
thy
people
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
not
deliver
him
in
the
day
of
his
transgression
as
for
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
he
shall
not
fall
thereby
in
the
day
that
he
turneth
from
his
wickedness
neither
shall
the
righteous
be
able
to
live
for
his
righteousness
in
the
day
that
he
sinneth
when
i
shall
say
to
the
righteous
that
he
shall
surely
live
if
he
trust
to
his
own
righteousness
and
commit
iniquity
all
his
righteousnesses
shall
not
be
remembered
but
for
his
iniquity
that
he
hath
committed
he
shall
die
for
it
again
when
i
say
unto
the
wicked
thou
shalt
surely
die
if
he
turn
from
his
sin
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
if
the
wicked
restore
the
pledge
give
again
that
he
had
robbed
walk
in
the
statutes
of
life
without
committing
iniquity
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
none
of
his
sins
that
he
hath
committed
shall
be
mentioned
unto
him
he
hath
done
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
surely
live
yet
the
children
of
thy
people
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
but
as
for
them
their
way
is
not
equal
when
the
righteous
turneth
from
his
righteousness
and
committeth
iniquity
he
shall
even
die
thereby
but
if
the
wicked
turn
from
his
wickedness
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
live
thereby
yet
ye
say
the
way
of
the
lord
is
not
equal
o
ye
house
of
israel
i
will
judge
you
every
one
after
his
ways
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twelfth
year
of
our
captivity
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
that
one
that
had
escaped
out
of
jerusalem
came
unto
me
saying
the
city
is
smitten
now
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
upon
me
in
the
evening
afore
he
that
was
escaped
came
and
had
opened
my
mouth
until
he
came
to
me
in
the
morning
and
my
mouth
was
opened
and
i
was
no
more
dumb
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
they
that
inhabit
those
wastes
of
the
land
of
israel
speak
saying
abraham
was
one
and
he
inherited
the
land
but
we
are
many
the
land
is
given
us
for
inheritance
wherefore
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
ye
eat
with
the
blood
and
lift
up
your
eyes
toward
your
idols
and
shed
blood
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land
ye
stand
upon
your
sword
ye
work
abomination
and
ye
defile
every
one
his
neighbour's
wife
and
shall
ye
possess
the
land
say
thou
thus
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
as
i
live
surely
they
that
are
in
the
wastes
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
him
that
is
in
the
open
field
will
i
give
to
the
beasts
to
be
devoured
and
they
that
be
in
the
forts
and
in
the
caves
shall
die
of
the
pestilence
for
i
will
lay
the
land
most
desolate
and
the
pomp
of
her
strength
shall
cease
and
the
mountains
of
israel
shall
be
desolate
that
none
shall
pass
through
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
laid
the
land
most
desolate
because
of
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
also
thou
son
of
man
the
children
of
thy
people
still
are
talking
against
thee
by
the
walls
and
in
the
doors
of
the
houses
and
speak
one
to
another
every
one
to
his
brother
saying
come
i
pray
you
and
hear
what
is
the
word
that
cometh
forth
from
the
lord
and
they
come
unto
thee
as
the
people
cometh
and
they
sit
before
thee
as
my
people
and
they
hear
thy
words
but
they
will
not
do
them
for
with
their
mouth
they
shew
much
love
but
their
heart
goeth
after
their
covetousness
and
lo
thou
art
unto
them
as
a
very
lovely
song
of
one
that
hath
a
pleasant
voice
and
can
play
well
on
an
instrument
for
they
hear
thy
words
but
they
do
them
not
and
when
this
cometh
to
pass
lo
it
will
come
then
shall
they
know
that
a
prophet
hath
been
among
them
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
of
israel
prophesy
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
the
shepherds
woe
be
to
the
shepherds
of
israel
that
do
feed
themselves
should
not
the
shepherds
feed
the
flocks
ye
eat
the
fat
and
ye
clothe
you
with
the
wool
ye
kill
them
that
are
fed
but
ye
feed
not
the
flock
the
diseased
have
ye
not
strengthened
neither
have
ye
healed
that
which
was
sick
neither
have
ye
bound
up
that
which
was
broken
neither
have
ye
brought
again
that
which
was
driven
away
neither
have
ye
sought
that
which
was
lost
but
with
force
and
with
cruelty
have
ye
ruled
them
and
they
were
scattered
because
there
is
no
shepherd
and
they
became
meat
to
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
when
they
were
scattered
my
sheep
wandered
through
all
the
mountains
and
upon
every
high
hill
yea
my
flock
was
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
none
did
search
or
seek
after
them
therefore
ye
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
surely
because
my
flock
became
a
prey
and
my
flock
became
meat
to
every
beast
of
the
field
because
there
was
no
shepherd
neither
did
my
shepherds
search
for
my
flock
but
the
shepherds
fed
themselves
and
fed
not
my
flock
therefore
o
ye
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
am
against
the
shepherds
and
i
will
require
my
flock
at
their
hand
and
cause
them
to
cease
from
feeding
the
flock
neither
shall
the
shepherds
feed
themselves
any
more
for
i
will
deliver
my
flock
from
their
mouth
that
they
may
not
be
meat
for
them
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
even
i
will
both
search
my
sheep
and
seek
them
out
as
a
shepherd
seeketh
out
his
flock
in
the
day
that
he
is
among
his
sheep
that
are
scattered
so
will
i
seek
out
my
sheep
and
will
deliver
them
out
of
all
places
where
they
have
been
scattered
in
the
cloudy
and
dark
day
and
i
will
bring
them
out
from
the
people
and
gather
them
from
the
countries
and
will
bring
them
to
their
own
land
and
feed
them
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
by
the
rivers
and
in
all
the
inhabited
places
of
the
country
i
will
feed
them
in
a
good
pasture
and
upon
the
high
mountains
of
israel
shall
their
fold
be
there
shall
they
lie
in
a
good
fold
and
in
a
fat
pasture
shall
they
feed
upon
the
mountains
of
israel
i
will
feed
my
flock
and
i
will
cause
them
to
lie
down
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
seek
that
which
was
lost
and
bring
again
that
which
was
driven
away
and
will
bind
up
that
which
was
broken
and
will
strengthen
that
which
was
sick
but
i
will
destroy
the
fat
and
the
strong
i
will
feed
them
with
judgment
and
as
for
you
o
my
flock
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle
between
the
rams
and
the
he
goats
seemeth
it
a
small
thing
unto
you
to
have
eaten
up
the
good
pasture
but
ye
must
tread
down
with
your
feet
the
residue
of
your
pastures
and
to
have
drunk
of
the
deep
waters
but
ye
must
foul
the
residue
with
your
feet
and
as
for
my
flock
they
eat
that
which
ye
have
trodden
with
your
feet
and
they
drink
that
which
ye
have
fouled
with
your
feet
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
them
behold
i
even
i
will
judge
between
the
fat
cattle
and
between
the
lean
cattle
because
ye
have
thrust
with
side
and
with
shoulder
and
pushed
all
the
diseased
with
your
horns
till
ye
have
scattered
them
abroad
therefore
will
i
save
my
flock
and
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey
and
i
will
judge
between
cattle
and
cattle
and
i
will
set
up
one
shepherd
over
them
and
he
shall
feed
them
even
my
servant
david
he
shall
feed
them
and
he
shall
be
their
shepherd
and
i
the
lord
will
be
their
god
and
my
servant
david
a
prince
among
them
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
i
will
make
with
them
a
covenant
of
peace
and
will
cause
the
evil
beasts
to
cease
out
of
the
land
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
wilderness
and
sleep
in
the
woods
and
i
will
make
them
and
the
places
round
about
my
hill
a
blessing
and
i
will
cause
the
shower
to
come
down
in
his
season
there
shall
be
showers
of
blessing
and
the
tree
of
the
field
shall
yield
her
fruit
and
the
earth
shall
yield
her
increase
and
they
shall
be
safe
in
their
land
and
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
broken
the
bands
of
their
yoke
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
served
themselves
of
them
and
they
shall
no
more
be
a
prey
to
the
heathen
neither
shall
the
beast
of
the
land
devour
them
but
they
shall
dwell
safely
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
and
i
will
raise
up
for
them
a
plant
of
renown
and
they
shall
be
no
more
consumed
with
hunger
in
the
land
neither
bear
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more
thus
shall
they
know
that
i
the
lord
their
god
am
with
them
and
that
they
even
the
house
of
israel
are
my
people
saith
the
lord
god
and
ye
my
flock
the
flock
of
my
pasture
are
men
and
i
am
your
god
saith
the
lord
god
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
set
thy
face
against
mount
seir
and
prophesy
against
it
and
say
unto
it
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
o
mount
seir
i
am
against
thee
and
i
will
stretch
out
mine
hand
against
thee
and
i
will
make
thee
most
desolate
i
will
lay
thy
cities
waste
and
thou
shalt
be
desolate
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
because
thou
hast
had
a
perpetual
hatred
and
hast
shed
the
blood
of
the
children
of
israel
by
the
force
of
the
sword
in
the
time
of
their
calamity
in
the
time
that
their
iniquity
had
an
end
therefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
prepare
thee
unto
blood
and
blood
shall
pursue
thee
sith
thou
hast
not
hated
blood
even
blood
shall
pursue
thee
thus
will
i
make
mount
seir
most
desolate
and
cut
off
from
it
him
that
passeth
out
and
him
that
returneth
and
i
will
fill
his
mountains
with
his
slain
men
in
thy
hills
and
in
thy
valleys
and
in
all
thy
rivers
shall
they
fall
that
are
slain
with
the
sword
i
will
make
thee
perpetual
desolations
and
thy
cities
shall
not
return
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
because
thou
hast
said
these
two
nations
and
these
two
countries
shall
be
mine
and
we
will
possess
it
whereas
the
lord
was
there
therefore
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
even
do
according
to
thine
anger
and
according
to
thine
envy
which
thou
hast
used
out
of
thy
hatred
against
them
and
i
will
make
myself
known
among
them
when
i
have
judged
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
that
i
have
heard
all
thy
blasphemies
which
thou
hast
spoken
against
the
mountains
of
israel
saying
they
are
laid
desolate
they
are
given
us
to
consume
thus
with
your
mouth
ye
have
boasted
against
me
and
have
multiplied
your
words
against
me
i
have
heard
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
whole
earth
rejoiceth
i
will
make
thee
desolate
as
thou
didst
rejoice
at
the
inheritance
of
the
house
of
israel
because
it
was
desolate
so
will
i
do
unto
thee
thou
shalt
be
desolate
o
mount
seir
and
all
idumea
even
all
of
it
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
also
thou
son
of
man
prophesy
unto
the
mountains
of
israel
and
say
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
the
enemy
hath
said
against
you
aha
even
the
ancient
high
places
are
ours
in
possession
therefore
prophesy
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
they
have
made
you
desolate
and
swallowed
you
up
on
every
side
that
ye
might
be
a
possession
unto
the
residue
of
the
heathen
and
ye
are
taken
up
in
the
lips
of
talkers
and
are
an
infamy
of
the
people
therefore
ye
mountains
of
israel
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
god
thus
saith
the
lord
god
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
valleys
to
the
desolate
wastes
and
to
the
cities
that
are
forsaken
which
became
a
prey
and
derision
to
the
residue
of
the
heathen
that
are
round
about
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
surely
in
the
fire
of
my
jealousy
have
i
spoken
against
the
residue
of
the
heathen
and
against
all
idumea
which
have
appointed
my
land
into
their
possession
with
the
joy
of
all
their
heart
with
despiteful
minds
to
cast
it
out
for
a
prey
prophesy
therefore
concerning
the
land
of
israel
and
say
unto
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
valleys
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
have
spoken
in
my
jealousy
and
in
my
fury
because
ye
have
borne
the
shame
of
the
heathen
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
have
lifted
up
mine
hand
surely
the
heathen
that
are
about
you
they
shall
bear
their
shame
but
ye
o
mountains
of
israel
ye
shall
shoot
forth
your
branches
and
yield
your
fruit
to
my
people
of
israel
for
they
are
at
hand
to
come
for
behold
i
am
for
you
and
i
will
turn
unto
you
and
ye
shall
be
tilled
and
sown
and
i
will
multiply
men
upon
you
all
the
house
of
israel
even
all
of
it
and
the
cities
shall
be
inhabited
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded
and
i
will
multiply
upon
you
man
and
beast
and
they
shall
increase
and
bring
fruit
and
i
will
settle
you
after
your
old
estates
and
will
do
better
unto
you
than
at
your
beginnings
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
yea
i
will
cause
men
to
walk
upon
you
even
my
people
israel
and
they
shall
possess
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
their
inheritance
and
thou
shalt
no
more
henceforth
bereave
them
of
men
thus
saith
the
lord
god
because
they
say
unto
you
thou
land
devourest
up
men
and
hast
bereaved
thy
nations
therefore
thou
shalt
devour
men
no
more
neither
bereave
thy
nations
any
more
saith
the
lord
god
neither
will
i
cause
men
to
hear
in
thee
the
shame
of
the
heathen
any
more
neither
shalt
thou
bear
the
reproach
of
the
people
any
more
neither
shalt
thou
cause
thy
nations
to
fall
any
more
saith
the
lord
god
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
son
of
man
when
the
house
of
israel
dwelt
in
their
own
land
they
defiled
it
by
their
own
way
and
by
their
doings
their
way
was
before
me
as
the
uncleanness
of
a
removed
woman
wherefore
i
poured
my
fury
upon
them
for
the
blood
that
they
had
shed
upon
the
land
and
for
their
idols
wherewith
they
had
polluted
it
and
i
scattered
them
among
the
heathen
and
they
were
dispersed
through
the
countries
according
to
their
way
and
according
to
their
doings
i
judged
them
and
when
they
entered
unto
the
heathen
whither
they
went
they
profaned
my
holy
name
when
they
said
to
them
these
are
the
people
of
the
lord
and
are
gone
forth
out
of
his
land
but
i
had
pity
for
mine
holy
name
which
the
house
of
israel
had
profaned
among
the
heathen
whither
they
went
therefore
say
unto
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
do
not
this
for
your
sakes
o
house
of
israel
but
for
mine
holy
name's
sake
which
ye
have
profaned
among
the
heathen
whither
ye
went
and
i
will
sanctify
my
great
name
which
was
profaned
among
the
heathen
which
ye
have
profaned
in
the
midst
of
them
and
the
heathen
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
saith
the
lord
god
when
i
shall
be
sanctified
in
you
before
their
eyes
for
i
will
take
you
from
among
the
heathen
and
gather
you
out
of
all
countries
and
will
bring
you
into
your
own
land
then
will
i
sprinkle
clean
water
upon
you
and
ye
shall
be
clean
from
all
your
filthiness
and
from
all
your
idols
will
i
cleanse
you
a
new
heart
also
will
i
give
you
and
a
new
spirit
will
i
put
within
you
and
i
will
take
away
the
stony
heart
out
of
your
flesh
and
i
will
give
you
an
heart
of
flesh
and
i
will
put
my
spirit
within
you
and
cause
you
to
walk
in
my
statutes
and
ye
shall
keep
my
judgments
and
do
them
and
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
land
that
i
gave
to
your
fathers
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
i
will
also
save
you
from
all
your
uncleannesses
and
i
will
call
for
the
corn
and
will
increase
it
and
lay
no
famine
upon
you
and
i
will
multiply
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
the
increase
of
the
field
that
ye
shall
receive
no
more
reproach
of
famine
among
the
heathen
then
shall
ye
remember
your
own
evil
ways
and
your
doings
that
were
not
good
and
shall
lothe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
your
iniquities
and
for
your
abominations
not
for
your
sakes
do
i
this
saith
the
lord
god
be
it
known
unto
you
be
ashamed
and
confounded
for
your
own
ways
o
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
in
the
day
that
i
shall
have
cleansed
you
from
all
your
iniquities
i
will
also
cause
you
to
dwell
in
the
cities
and
the
wastes
shall
be
builded
and
the
desolate
land
shall
be
tilled
whereas
it
lay
desolate
in
the
sight
of
all
that
passed
by
and
they
shall
say
this
land
that
was
desolate
is
become
like
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
waste
and
desolate
and
ruined
cities
are
become
fenced
and
are
inhabited
then
the
heathen
that
are
left
round
about
you
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
build
the
ruined
places
and
plant
that
that
was
desolate
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
i
will
do
it
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
yet
for
this
be
enquired
of
by
the
house
of
israel
to
do
it
for
them
i
will
increase
them
with
men
like
a
flock
as
the
holy
flock
as
the
flock
of
jerusalem
in
her
solemn
feasts
so
shall
the
waste
cities
be
filled
with
flocks
of
men
and
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
upon
me
and
carried
me
out
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
set
me
down
in
the
midst
of
the
valley
which
was
full
of
bones
and
caused
me
to
pass
by
them
round
about
and
behold
there
were
very
many
in
the
open
valley
and
lo
they
were
very
dry
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
can
these
bones
live
and
i
answered
o
lord
god
thou
knowest
again
he
said
unto
me
prophesy
upon
these
bones
and
say
unto
them
o
ye
dry
bones
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
god
unto
these
bones
behold
i
will
cause
breath
to
enter
into
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
i
will
lay
sinews
upon
you
and
will
bring
up
flesh
upon
you
and
cover
you
with
skin
and
put
breath
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
so
i
prophesied
as
i
was
commanded
and
as
i
prophesied
there
was
a
noise
and
behold
a
shaking
and
the
bones
came
together
bone
to
his
bone
and
when
i
beheld
lo
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
came
up
upon
them
and
the
skin
covered
them
above
but
there
was
no
breath
in
them
then
said
he
unto
me
prophesy
unto
the
wind
prophesy
son
of
man
and
say
to
the
wind
thus
saith
the
lord
god
come
from
the
four
winds
o
breath
and
breathe
upon
these
slain
that
they
may
live
so
i
prophesied
as
he
commanded
me
and
the
breath
came
into
them
and
they
lived
and
stood
up
upon
their
feet
an
exceeding
great
army
then
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
these
bones
are
the
whole
house
of
israel
behold
they
say
our
bones
are
dried
and
our
hope
is
lost
we
are
cut
off
for
our
parts
therefore
prophesy
and
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
o
my
people
i
will
open
your
graves
and
cause
you
to
come
up
out
of
your
graves
and
bring
you
into
the
land
of
israel
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
opened
your
graves
o
my
people
and
brought
you
up
out
of
your
graves
and
shall
put
my
spirit
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
and
i
shall
place
you
in
your
own
land
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
the
lord
have
spoken
it
and
performed
it
saith
the
lord
the
word
of
the
lord

the
heathen
shall
know
that
the
house
of
israel
went
into
captivity
for
their
iniquity
because
they
trespassed
against
me
therefore
hid
i
my
face
from
them
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
so
fell
they
all
by
the
sword
according
to
their
uncleanness
and
according
to
their
transgressions
have
i
done
unto
them
and
hid
my
face
from
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
now
will
i
bring
again
the
captivity
of
jacob
and
have
mercy
upon
the
whole
house
of
israel
and
will
be
jealous
for
my
holy
name
after
that
they
have
borne
their
shame
and
all
their
trespasses
whereby
they
have
trespassed
against
me
when
they
dwelt
safely
in
their
land
and
none
made
them
afraid
when
i
have
brought
them
again
from
the
people
and
gathered
them
out
of
their
enemies
lands
and
am
sanctified
in
them
in
the
sight
of
many
nations
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god
which
caused
them
to
be
led
into
captivity
among
the
heathen
but
i
have
gathered
them
unto
their
own
land
and
have
left
none
of
them
any
more
there
neither
will
i
hide
my
face
any
more
from
them
for

poured
out
my
spirit

of
the

was
still
upward
and
so
increased
from
the
lowest
chamber
to
the
highest
by

broad
and
the

of
the

was
five

and
he
measured
the
length
of
the
building
over
against
the
separate
place
which
was
behind
it
and
the
galleries
thereof
on
the
one

and
the

on
their
three

over

cieled
with

and
the

the

even
unto
the
inner
house
and
without
and
by
all
the
wall
round
about
within
and
without
by
measure
and
it
was
made
with
cherubims
and
palm
trees
so
that
a
palm
tree
was
between
a
cherub
and
a
cherub
and
every
cherub
had
two
faces
so
that
the
face
of
a
man
was
toward
the
palm

on
the
one

and
the
face
of
a

toward

on

it
was
made
through
all
the

round
about
from
the

unto
above
the

were
cherubims
and
palm

made
and
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
the
posts
of
the
temple
were
squared
and
the
face
of
the
sanctuary
the
appearance
of
the
one
as
the
appearance
of
the
other
the
altar
of
wood
was
three
cubits
high
and
the
length
thereof
two
cubits
and
the
corners
thereof
and
the
length
thereof
and
the
walls
thereof
were
of
wood
and
he
said
unto
me
this
is
the
table
that
is
before
the
lord
and
the
temple
and
the
sanctuary
had
two
doors
and
the
doors
had
two
leaves
apiece
two
turning
leaves
two
leaves
for
the
one
door
and
two
leaves
for
the
other
door
and
there
were
made
on
them
on
the
doors
of
the
temple
cherubims
and
palm
trees
like
as
were
made
upon
the
walls
and
there
were
thick
planks
upon
the
face
of
the
porch
without
and
there
were
narrow
windows
and
palm

on
the
one

and
on
the
other
side
on
the
sides
of
the
porch
and
upon
the
side
chambers
of
the
house
and
thick
planks
then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court
the
way
toward
the
north
and
he
brought
me
into
the
chamber
that
was
over
against
the
separate
place
and
which
was
before
the
building
toward
the
north
before
the
length
of
an
hundred
cubits
was
the
north

and
the
breadth
was
fifty
cubits
over
against
the
twenty

which
were
for
the
inner

and
over
against
the
pavement
which
was
for
the
utter

was
gallery
against
gallery
in
three
stories
and
before
the
chambers
was
a
walk
to
ten
cubits
breadth
inward
a
way
of
one
cubit
and
their
doors
toward
the
north
now
the
upper
chambers
were
shorter
for
the
galleries
were
higher
than
these
than
the
lower
and
than
the
middlemost
of
the
building
for
they
were
in
three
stories
but
had
not
pillars
as
the
pillars
of
the
courts
therefore
the
building
was
straitened
more
than
the
lowest
and
the
middlemost
from
the
ground
and
the
wall
that
was
without
over
against
the
chambers
toward
the
utter

on
the
forepart
of
the

the

thereof
was
fifty

for
the

of
the

that
were
in
the
utter

was
fifty
cubits
and
lo
before
the
temple
were
an
hundred
cubits
and
from
under
these
chambers
was
the
entry
on
the
east
side
as
one
goeth
into
them
from
the
utter
court
the
chambers
were
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
of
the
court
toward
the
east
over
against
the
separate
place
and
over
against
the
building
and
the
way
before
them
was
like
the
appearance
of
the
chambers
which
were
toward
the
north
as
long
as
they
and
as
broad
as
they
and
all
their
goings
out
were
both
according
to
their
fashions
and
according
to
their
doors
and
according
to
the
doors
of
the
chambers
that
were
toward
the
south
was
a
door
in
the
head
of
the
way
even
the
way
directly
before
the
wall
toward
the
east
as
one
entereth
into
them
then
said
he
unto
me
the
north
chambers
and
the
south
chambers
which
are
before
the
separate
place
they
be
holy
chambers
where
the
priests
that
approach
unto
the
lord
shall
eat
the
most
holy
things
there
shall
they
lay
the
most
holy
things
and
the
meat
offering
and
the
sin
offering
and
the
trespass
offering
for
the
place
is
holy
when
the
priests
enter
therein
then
shall
they
not
go
out
of
the
holy
place
into
the
utter
court
but
there
they
shall
lay
their
garments
wherein
they
minister
for
they
are
holy
and
shall
put
on
other
garments
and
shall
approach
to
those
things
which
are
for
the
people
now
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
measuring
the
inner
house
he
brought
me
forth
toward
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east
and
measured
it
round
about
he
measured
the
east
side
with
the
measuring
reed
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
round
about
he
measured
the

with
the

round
about
he
measured
the
south
side
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
he
turned
about
to
the
west
side
and
measured
five
hundred
reeds
with
the
measuring
reed
he
measured
it
by
the
four
sides
it
had
a
wall
round
about
five
hundred
reeds
long
and
five
hundred
broad
to
make
a
separation
between
the
sanctuary
and
the
profane
place
afterward
he
brought
me
to
the
gate
even
the
gate
that
looketh
toward
the
east
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
god
of
israel
came
from
the
way
of
the
east
and
his
voice
was
like
a
noise
of
many
waters
and
the
earth
shined
with
his
glory
and
it
was
according
to
the
appearance
of
the
vision
which
i
saw
even
according
to
the
vision
that
i
saw
when
i
came
to
destroy
the
city
and
the
visions
were
like
the
vision
that
i
saw
by
the
river
chebar
and
i
fell
upon
my
face
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
came
into
the
house
by
the
way
of
the
gate
whose
prospect
is
toward
the
east
so
the
spirit
took
me
up
and
brought
me
into
the
inner
court
and
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
house
and
i
heard
him
speaking
unto
me

of
my
feet

between
me
and
them
they
have
even
defiled
my
holy
name
by
their
abominations
that
they
have
committed
wherefore
i
have
consumed
them
in
mine
anger
now
let
them
put
away
their
whoredom
and
the
carcases
of
their
kings
far
from
me
and
i
will
dwell

the
midst
of
them
for

of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
o
ye
house
of
israel
let
it
suffice
you
of
all
your
abominations
in
that
ye
have
brought
into
my
sanctuary
strangers
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
uncircumcised
in
flesh
to
be
in
my
sanctuary
to
pollute
it
even
my

when
ye
offer
my

and
they
have
broken
my
covenant
because
of
all
your
abominations
and
ye

not
kept
the
charge
of
mine
holy
things
but
ye
have
set
keepers
of
my
charge
in

for
yourselves

god
no
stranger
uncircumcised
in
heart
nor
uncircumcised
in
flesh
shall
enter
into

sanctuary
of
any
stranger
that

astray
away
from
me
after

even
bear
their
iniquity
yet
they
shall
be
ministers
in

they
shall
slay
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifice
for
the
people
and
they
shall
stand
before
them
to
minister
unto
them
because
they
ministered
unto
them
before
their
idols
and
caused
the
house
of
israel
to
fall
into
iniquity
therefore
have
i
lifted
up
mine
hand
against
them
saith
the
lord
god
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
and
they
shall

the
office
of
a
priest
unto
me
nor
to
come
near
to
any
of
my
holy
things
in
the
most
holy
place
but
they
shall
bear
their
shame
and
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
but
i
will
make
them
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
house
for
all
the
service
thereof
and
for
all
that
shall
be
done
therein
but
the
priests
the
levites
the
sons
of
zadok
that
kept
the
charge
of
my
sanctuary
when
the
children
of
israel
went
astray
from
me
they
shall
come
near
to
me
to
minister
unto
me
and
they
shall
stand
before
me
to
offer
unto
me
the
fat
and
the
blood
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary
and
they
shall
come
near
to
my
table
to
minister
unto
me
and
they
shall
keep
my
charge
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
enter
in
at
the
gates
of
the
inner
court
they
shall
be
clothed
with
linen
garments
and

them
whiles
they
minister
in

shall
give
his
sons
inheritance
out
of
his
own
possession
that
my
people
be
not
scattered
every
man
from
his

after
he
brought
me
through
the
entry
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
gate
into
the
holy
chambers
of
the
priests
which
looked
toward
the
north
and
behold
there
was
a
place
on
the
two
sides
westward
then
said
he
unto
me
this
is
the
place
where
the
priests
shall
boil
the
trespass
offering
and
the
sin
offering
where
they
shall
bake
the
meat
offering
that
they
bear
them
not
out
into
the
utter
court
to
sanctify
the
people
then
he
brought
me
forth
into
the
utter
court
and
caused
me
to
pass
by
the
four
corners
of
the
court
and
behold
in
every
corner
of
the
court
there
was
a
court
in
the
four
corners
of
the
court
there
were
courts
joined
of
forty
cubits
long
and
thirty
broad
these
four
corners
were
of
one
measure
and
there
was
a
row
of
building
round
about
in
them
round
about
them
four
and
it
was
made
with
boiling
places
under
the
rows
round
about
then
said
he
unto
me
these
are
the
places
of
them
that
boil
where
the
ministers
of
the
house
shall
boil
the
sacrifice
of
the
people
afterward
he
brought
me
again
unto
the
door
of
the
house
and
behold
waters
issued
out
from
under
the
threshold
of
the
house
eastward
for
the
forefront
of
the
house
stood
toward
the
east
and
the
waters
came
down
from
under
from
the
right
side
of
the
house
at
the
south
side
of
the
altar
then
brought
he
me
out
of
the
way
of
the
gate
northward
and
led
me
about
the
way
without
unto
the
utter
gate
by
the
way
that
looketh
eastward
and
behold
there
ran
out
waters
on
the
right
side
and
when
the
man
that
had
the
line
in
his
hand
went
forth
eastward
he
measured
a
thousand
cubits
and
he
brought
me
through
the
waters
the
waters
were
to
the
ankles
again
he
measured
a
thousand
and
brought
me
through
the
waters
the
waters
were
to
the
knees
again
he
measured
a
thousand
and
brought
me
through
the
waters
were
to
the
loins
afterward
he
measured
a
thousand
and
it
was
a
river
that
i
could
not
pass
over
for
the
waters
were
risen
waters
to
swim
in
a
river
that
could
not
be
passed
over
and
he
said
unto
me
son
of
man
hast
thou
seen
this
then
he
brought
me
and
caused
me
to
return
to
the
brink
of
the
river
now
when
i
had
returned
behold
at
the
bank
of
the
river
were
very
many
trees
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
then
said
he
unto
me
these
waters
issue
out
toward
the
east
country
and
go
down
into
the
desert
and
go
into
the
sea
which
being
brought
forth
into
the
sea
the
waters
shall
be
healed
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
thing
that
liveth
which
moveth
whithersoever
the
rivers
shall
come
shall
live
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
multitude
of
fish
because
these
waters
shall
come
thither
for
they
shall
be
healed
and
every
thing
shall
live
whither
the
river
cometh
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that

shall
stand
upon
it
from
engedi
even
unto
eneglaim
they
shall
be
a
place
to
spread
forth
nets
their

shall
be
according
to
their
kinds
as
the
fish
of
the
great
sea
exceeding
many
but
the
miry
places
thereof
and
the
marishes
thereof
shall
not
be
healed
they
shall
be
given
to
salt
and
by
the
river
upon
the
bank
thereof
on
this
side
and
on
that
side
shall
grow
all
trees
for
meat
whose
leaf
shall
not
fade
neither
shall
the
fruit
thereof
be
consumed
it

bring

they
issued

the

is
there
the
book
of
daniel
in
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
came
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
unto
jerusalem
and
besieged
it
and
the
lord
gave
jehoiakim
king
of
judah
into
his
hand
with
part
of
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
which
he
carried
into
the
land
of
shinar
to
the
house
of
his
god
and
he
brought
the
vessels
into
the
treasure
house
of
his
god
and
the
king
spake
unto
ashpenaz
the
master
of
his
eunuchs
that
he
should
bring
certain
of
the
children
of
israel
and
of
the
king's
seed
and
of
the
princes
children
in
whom
was
no
blemish
but
well
favoured
and
skilful
in
all
wisdom
and
cunning
in
knowledge
and
understanding
science
and
such
as
had
ability
in
them
to
stand
in
the
king's
palace
and
whom
they
might
teach
the
learning
and
the
tongue
of
the
chaldeans
and
the
king
appointed
them
a
daily
provision
of
the
king's
meat
and
of
the
wine
which
he
drank
so
nourishing
them
three
years
that
at
the
end
thereof
they
might
stand
before
the
king
now
among
these
were
of
the
children
of
judah
daniel
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
unto
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
gave
names
for
he
gave
unto
daniel
the
name
of
belteshazzar
and
to
hananiah
of
shadrach
and
to
mishael
of
meshach
and
to
azariah
of
abednego
but
daniel
purposed
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat
nor
with
the
wine
which
he
drank
therefore
he
requested
of
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
that
he
might
not
defile
himself
now
god
had
brought
daniel
into
favour
and
tender
love
with
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
and
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
said
unto
daniel
i
fear
my
lord
the
king
who
hath
appointed
your
meat
and
your
drink
for
why
should
he
see
your
faces
worse
liking
than
the
children
which
are
of
your
sort
then
shall
ye
make
me
endanger
my
head
to
the
king
then
said
daniel
to
melzar
whom
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
had
set
over
daniel
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
prove
thy
servants
i
beseech
thee
ten
days
and
let
them
give
us
pulse
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
then
let
our
countenances
be
looked
upon
before
thee
and
the
countenance
of
the
children
that
eat
of
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat
and
as
thou
seest
deal
with
thy
servants
so
he
consented
to
them
in
this
matter
and
proved
them
ten
days
and
at
the
end
of
ten
days
their
countenances
appeared
fairer
and
fatter
in
flesh
than
all
the
children
which
did
eat
the
portion
of
the
king's
meat
thus
melzar
took
away
the
portion
of
their
meat
and
the
wine
that
they
should
drink
and
gave
them
pulse
as
for
these
four
children
god
gave
them
knowledge
and
skill
in
all
learning
and
wisdom
and
daniel
had
understanding
in
all
visions
and
dreams
now
at
the
end
of
the
days
that
the
king
had
said
he
should
bring
them
in
then
the
prince
of
the
eunuchs
brought
them
in
before
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
king
communed
with
them
and
among
them
all
was
found
none
like
daniel
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
therefore
stood
they
before
the
king
and
in
all
matters
of
wisdom
and
understanding
that
the
king
enquired
of
them
he
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magicians
and
astrologers
that
were
in
all
his
realm
and
daniel
continued
even
unto
the
first
year
of
king
cyrus
and
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
nebuchadnezzar
nebuchadnezzar
dreamed
dreams
wherewith
his
spirit
was
troubled
and
his
sleep
brake
from
him
then
the
king
commanded
to
call
the
magicians
and
the
astrologers
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
chaldeans
for
to
shew
the
king
his
dreams
so
they
came
and
stood
before
the
king
and
the
king
said
unto
them
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
and
my
spirit
was
troubled
to
know
the
dream
then
spake
the
chaldeans
to
the
king
in
syriack
o
king
live
for
ever
tell
thy
servants
the
dream
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
the
king
answered
and
said
to
the
chaldeans
the
thing
is
gone
from
me
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
with
the
interpretation
thereof
ye
shall
be
cut
in
pieces
and
your
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill
but
if
ye
shew
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
ye
shall
receive
of
me
gifts
and
rewards
and
great
honour
therefore
shew
me
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
they
answered
again
and
said
let
the
king
tell
his
servants
the
dream
and
we
will
shew
the
interpretation
of
it
the
king
answered
and
said
i
know
of
certainty
that
ye
would
gain
the
time
because
ye
see
the
thing
is
gone
from
me
but
if
ye
will
not
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
there
is
but
one
decree
for
you
for
ye
have
prepared
lying
and
corrupt
words
to
speak
before
me
till
the
time
be
changed
therefore
tell
me
the
dream
and
i
shall
know
that
ye
can
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof
the
chaldeans
answered
before
the
king
and
said
there
is
not
a
man
upon
the
earth
that
can
shew
the
king's
matter
therefore
there
is
no
king
lord
nor
ruler
that
asked
such
things
at
any
magician
or
astrologer
or
chaldean
and
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
the
king
requireth
and
there
is
none
other
that
can
shew
it
before
the
king
except
the
gods
whose
dwelling
is
not
with
flesh
for
this
cause
the
king
was
angry
and
very
furious
and
commanded
to
destroy
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
and
the
decree
went
forth
that
the
wise
men
should
be
slain
and
they
sought
daniel
and
his
fellows
to
be
slain
then
daniel
answered
with
counsel
and
wisdom
to
arioch
the
captain
of
the
king's
guard
which
was
gone
forth
to
slay
the
wise
men
of
babylon
he
answered
and
said
to
arioch
the
king's
captain
why
is
the
decree
so
hasty
from
the
king
then
arioch
made
the
thing
known
to
daniel
then
daniel
went
in
and
desired
of
the
king
that
he
would
give
him
time
and
that
he
would
shew
the
king
the
interpretation
then
daniel
went
to
his
house
and
made
the
thing
known
to
hananiah
mishael
and
azariah
his
companions
that
they
would
desire
mercies
of
the
god
of
heaven
concerning
this
secret
that
daniel
and
his
fellows
should
not
perish
with
the
rest
of
the
wise
men
of
babylon
then
was
the
secret
revealed
unto
daniel
in
a
night
vision
then
daniel
blessed
the
god
of
heaven
daniel
answered
and
said
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
for
ever
and
ever
for
wisdom
and
might
are
his
and
he
changeth
the
times
and
the
seasons
he
removeth
kings
and
setteth
up
kings
he
giveth
wisdom
unto
the
wise
and
knowledge
to
them
that
know
understanding
he
revealeth
the
deep
and
secret
things
he
knoweth
what
is
in
the
darkness
and
the
light
dwelleth
with
him
i
thank
thee
and
praise
thee
o
thou
god
of
my
fathers
who
hast
given
me
wisdom
and
might
and
hast
made
known
unto
me
now
what
we
desired
of
thee
for
thou
hast
now
made
known
unto
us
the
king's
matter
therefore
daniel
went
in
unto
arioch
whom
the
king
had
ordained
to
destroy
the
wise
men
of
babylon
he
went
and
said
thus
unto
him
destroy
not
the
wise
men
of
babylon
bring
me
in
before
the
king
and
i
will
shew
unto
the
king
the
interpretation
then
arioch
brought
in
daniel
before
the
king
in
haste
and
said
thus
unto
him
i
have
found
a
man
of
the
captives
of
judah
that
will
make
known
unto
the
king
the
interpretation
the
king
answered
and
said
to
daniel
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
art
thou
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
dream
which
i
have
seen
and
the
interpretation
thereof
daniel
answered
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
said
the
secret
which
the
king
hath
demanded
cannot
the
wise
men
the
astrologers
the
magicians
the
soothsayers
shew
unto
the
king
but
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
that
revealeth
secrets
and
maketh
known
to
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
what
shall
be
in
the
latter
days
thy
dream
and
the
visions
of
thy
head
upon
thy
bed
are
these
as
for
thee
o
king
thy
thoughts
came
into
thy
mind
upon
thy
bed
what
should
come
to
pass
hereafter
and
he
that
revealeth
secrets
maketh
known
to
thee
what
shall
come
to
pass
but
as
for
me
this
secret
is
not
revealed
to
me
for
any
wisdom
that
i
have
more
than
any
living
but
for
their
sakes
that
shall
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
king
and
that
thou
mightest
know
the
thoughts
of
thy
heart
thou
o
king
sawest
and
behold
a
great
image
this
great
image
whose
brightness
was
excellent
stood
before
thee
and
the
form
thereof
was
terrible
this
image's
head
was
of
fine
gold
his
breast
and
his
arms
of
silver
his
belly
and
his
thighs
of
brass
his
legs
of
iron
his
feet
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay
thou
sawest
till
that
a
stone
was
cut
out
without
hands
which
smote
the
image
upon
his
feet
that
were
of
iron
and
clay
and
brake
them
to
pieces
then
was
the
iron
the
clay
the
brass
the
silver
and
the
gold
broken
to
pieces
together
and
became
like
the
chaff
of
the
summer
threshingfloors
and
the
wind
carried
them
away
that
no
place
was
found
for
them
and
the
stone
that
smote
the
image
became
a
great
mountain
and
filled
the
whole
earth
this
is
the
dream
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
thereof
before
the
king
thou
o
king
art
a
king
of
kings
for
the
god
of
heaven
hath
given
thee
a
kingdom
power
and
strength
and
glory
and
wheresoever
the
children
of
men
dwell
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
hath
he
given
into
thine
hand
and
hath
made
thee
ruler
over
them
all
thou
art
this
head
of
gold
and
after
thee
shall
arise
another
kingdom
inferior
to
thee
and
another
third
kingdom
of
brass
which
shall
bear
rule
over
all
the
earth
and
the
fourth
kingdom
shall
be
strong
as
iron
forasmuch
as
iron
breaketh
in
pieces
and
subdueth
all
things
and
as
iron
that
breaketh
all
these
shall
it
break
in
pieces
and
bruise
and
whereas
thou
sawest
the
feet
and
toes
part
of
potters
clay
and
part
of
iron
the
kingdom
shall
be
divided
but
there
shall
be
in
it
of
the
strength
of
the
iron
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
the
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay
and
as
the
toes
of
the
feet
were
part
of
iron
and
part
of
clay
so
the
kingdom
shall
be
partly
strong
and
partly
broken
and
whereas
thou
sawest
iron
mixed
with
miry
clay
they
shall
mingle
themselves
with
the
seed
of
men
but
they
shall
not
cleave
one
to
another
even
as
iron
is
not
mixed
with
clay
and
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
the
god
of
heaven
set
up
a
kingdom
which
shall
never
be
destroyed
and
the
kingdom
shall
not
be
left
to
other
people
but
it
shall
break
in
pieces
and
consume
all
these
kingdoms
and
it
shall
stand
for
ever
forasmuch
as
thou
sawest
that
the
stone
was
cut
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands
and
that
it
brake
in
pieces
the
iron
the
brass
the
clay
the
silver
and
the
gold
the
great
god
hath
made
known
to
the
king
what
shall
come
to
pass
hereafter
and
the
dream
is
certain
and
the
interpretation
thereof
sure
then
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
fell
upon
his
face
and
worshipped
daniel
and
commanded
that
they
should
offer
an
oblation
and
sweet
odours
unto
him
the
king
answered
unto
daniel
and
said
of
a
truth
it
is
that
your
god
is
a
god
of
gods
and
a
lord
of
kings
and
a
revealer
of
secrets
seeing
thou
couldest
reveal
this
secret
then
the
king
made
daniel
a
great
man
and
gave
him
many
great
gifts
and
made
him
ruler
over
the
whole
province
of
babylon
and
chief
of
the
governors
over
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
then
daniel
requested
of
the
king
and
he
set
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
babylon
but
daniel
sat
in
the
gate
of
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
made
an
image
of
gold
whose
height
was
threescore
cubits
and
the
breadth
thereof
six
cubits
he
set
it
up
in
the
plain
of
dura
in
the
province
of
babylon
then
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
sent
to
gather
together
the
princes
the
governors
and
the
captains
the
judges
the
treasurers
the
counsellors
the
sheriffs
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
to
come
to
the
dedication
of
the
image
which
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
then
the
princes
the
governors
and
captains
the
judges
the
treasurers
the
counsellors
the
sheriffs
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
were
gathered
together
unto
the
dedication
of
the
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
and
they
stood
before
the
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
then
an
herald
cried
aloud
to
you
it
is
commanded
o
people
nations
and
languages
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
hath
set
up
and
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
shall
the
same
hour
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
therefore
at
that
time
when
all
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
all
kinds
of
musick
all
the
people
the
nations
and
the
languages
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
golden
image
that
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
had
set
up
wherefore
at
that
time
certain
chaldeans
came
near
and
accused
the
jews
they
spake
and
said
to
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
o
king
live
for
ever
thou
o
king
hast
made
a
decree
that
every
man
that
shall
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
shall
fall
down
and
worship
the
golden
image
and
whoso
falleth
not
down
and
worshippeth
that
he
should
be
cast
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
there
are
certain
jews
whom
thou
hast
set
over
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
babylon
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
these
men
o
king
have
not
regarded
thee
they
serve
not
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
then
nebuchadnezzar
in
his
rage
and
fury
commanded
to
bring
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
then
they
brought
these
men
before
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
unto
them
is
it
true
o
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
do
not
ye
serve
my
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
i
have
set
up
now
if
ye
be
ready
that
at
what
time
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
cornet
flute
harp
sackbut
psaltery
and
dulcimer
and
all
kinds
of
musick
ye
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
which
i
have
made
well
but
if
ye
worship
not
ye
shall
be
cast
the
same
hour
into
the
midst
of
a
burning
fiery
furnace
and
who
is
that
god
that
shall
deliver
you
out
of
my
hands
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
answered
and
said
to
the
king
o
nebuchadnezzar
we
are
not
careful
to
answer
thee
in
this
matter
if
it
be
so
our
god
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
deliver
us
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace
and
he
will
deliver
us
out
of
thine
hand
o
king
but
if
not
be
it
known
unto
thee
o
king
that
we
will
not
serve
thy
gods
nor
worship
the
golden
image
which
thou
hast
set
up
then
was
nebuchadnezzar
full
of
fury
and
the
form
of
his
visage
was
changed
against
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
therefore
he
spake
and
commanded
that
they
should
heat
the
furnace
one
seven
times
more
than
it
was
wont
to
be
heated
and
he
commanded
the
most
mighty
men
that
were
in
his
army
to
bind
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
and
to
cast
them
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
then
these
men
were
bound
in
their
coats
their
hosen
and
their
hats
and
their
other
garments
and
were
cast
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
therefore
because
the
king's
commandment
was
urgent
and
the
furnace
exceeding
hot
the
flames
of
the
fire
slew
those
men
that
took
up
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
and
these
three
men
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
fell
down
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
then
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
was
astonied
and
rose
up
in
haste
and
spake
and
said
unto
his
counsellors
did
not
we
cast
three
men
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
they
answered
and
said
unto
the
king
true
o
king
he
answered
and
said
lo
i
see
four
men
loose
walking
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
they
have
no
hurt
and
the
form
of
the
fourth
is
like
the
son
of
god
then
nebuchadnezzar
came
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
and
spake
and
said
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
ye
servants
of
the
most
high
god
come
forth
and
come
hither
then
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
came
forth
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
the
princes
governors
and
captains
and
the
king's
counsellors
being
gathered
together
saw
these
men
upon
whose
bodies
the
fire
had
no
power
nor
was
an
hair
of
their
head
singed
neither
were
their
coats
changed
nor
the
smell
of
fire
had
passed
on
them
then
nebuchadnezzar
spake
and
said
blessed
be
the
god
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
who
hath
sent
his
angel
and
delivered
his
servants
that
trusted
in
him
and
have
changed
the
king's
word
and
yielded
their
bodies
that
they
might
not
serve
nor
worship
any
god
except
their
own
god
therefore
i
make
a
decree
that
every
people
nation
and
language
which
speak
any
thing
amiss
against
the
god
of
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
shall
be
cut
in
pieces
and
their
houses
shall
be
made
a
dunghill
because
there
is
no
other
god
that
can
deliver
after
this
sort
then
the
king
promoted
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
in
the
province
of
babylon
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
unto
all
people
nations
and
languages
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
i
thought
it
good
to
shew
the
signs
and
wonders
that
the
high
god
hath
wrought
toward
me
how
great
are
his
signs
and
how
mighty
are
his
wonders
his
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
his
dominion
is
from
generation
to
generation
i
nebuchadnezzar
was
at
rest
in
mine
house
and
flourishing
in
my
palace
i
saw
a
dream
which
made
me
afraid
and
the
thoughts
upon
my
bed
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me
therefore
made
i
a
decree
to
bring
in
all
the
wise
men
of
babylon
before
me
that
they
might
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
then
came
in
the
magicians
the
astrologers
the
chaldeans
and
the
soothsayers
and
i
told
the
dream
before
them
but
they
did
not
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof
but
at
the
last
daniel
came
in
before
me
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
according
to
the
name
of
my
god
and
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
before
him
i
told
the
dream
saying
o
belteshazzar
master
of
the
magicians
because
i
know
that
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee
and
no
secret
troubleth
thee
tell
me
the
visions
of
my
dream
that
i
have
seen
and
the
interpretation
thereof
thus
were
the
visions
of
mine
head
in
my
bed
i
saw
and
behold
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
and
the
height
thereof
was
great
the
tree
grew
and
was
strong
and
the
height
thereof
reached
unto
heaven
and
the
sight
thereof
to
the
end
of
all
the
earth
the
leaves
thereof
were
fair
and
the
fruit
thereof
much
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
shadow
under
it
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
dwelt
in
the
boughs
thereof
and
all
flesh
was
fed
of
it
i
saw
in
the
visions
of
my
head
upon
my
bed
and
behold
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
came
down
from
heaven
he
cried
aloud
and
said
thus
hew
down
the
tree
and
cut
off
his
branches
shake
off
his
leaves
and
scatter
his
fruit
let
the
beasts
get
away
from
under
it
and
the
fowls
from
his
branches
nevertheless
leave
the
stump
of
his
roots
in
the
earth
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
in
the
grass
of
the
earth
let
his
heart
be
changed
from
man's
and
let
a
beast's
heart
be
given
unto
him
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
him
this
matter
is
by
the
decree
of
the
watchers
and
the
demand
by
the
word
of
the
holy
ones
to
the
intent
that
the
living
may
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of
men
this
dream
i
king
nebuchadnezzar
have
seen
now
thou
o
belteshazzar
declare
the
interpretation
thereof
forasmuch
as
all
the
wise
men
of
my
kingdom
are
not
able
to
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
but
thou
art
able
for
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
thee
then
daniel
whose
name
was
belteshazzar
was
astonied
for
one
hour
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him
the
king
spake
and
said
belteshazzar
let
not
the
dream
or
the
interpretation
thereof
trouble
thee
belteshazzar
answered
and
said
my
lord
the
dream
be
to
them
that
hate
thee
and
the
interpretation
thereof
to
thine
enemies
the
tree
that
thou
sawest
which
grew
and
was
strong
whose
height
reached
unto
the
heaven
and
the
sight
thereof
to
all
the
earth
whose
leaves
were
fair
and
the
fruit
thereof
much
and
in
it
was
meat
for
all
under
which
the
beasts
of
the
field
dwelt
and
upon
whose
branches
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
had
their
habitation
it
is
thou
o
king
that
art
grown
and
become
strong
for
thy
greatness
is
grown
and
reacheth
unto
heaven
and
thy
dominion
to
the
end
of
the
earth
and
whereas
the
king
saw
a
watcher
and
an
holy
one
coming
down
from
heaven
and
saying
hew
the
tree
down
and
destroy
it
yet
leave
the
stump
of
the
roots
thereof
in
the
earth
even
with
a
band
of
iron
and
brass
in
the
tender
grass
of
the
field
and
let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
let
his
portion
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
till
seven
times
pass
over
him
this
is
the
interpretation
o
king
and
this
is
the
decree
of
the
most
high
which
is
come
upon
my
lord
the
king
that
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
they
shall
wet
thee
with
the
dew
of
heaven
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee
till
thou
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
and
whereas
they
commanded
to
leave
the
stump
of
the
tree
roots
thy
kingdom
shall
be
sure
unto
thee
after
that
thou
shalt
have
known
that
the
heavens
do
rule
wherefore
o
king
let
my
counsel
be
acceptable
unto
thee
and
break
off
thy
sins
by
righteousness
and
thine
iniquities
by
shewing
mercy
to
the
poor
if
it
may
be
a
lengthening
of
thy
tranquillity
all
this
came
upon
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
at
the
end
of
twelve
months
he
walked
in
the
palace
of
the
kingdom
of
babylon
the
king
spake
and
said
is
not
this
great
babylon
that
i
have
built
for
the
house
of
the
kingdom
by
the
might
of
my
power
and
for
the
honour
of
my
majesty
while
the
word
was
in
the
king's
mouth
there
fell
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
o
king
nebuchadnezzar
to
thee
it
is
spoken
the
kingdom
is
departed
from
thee
and
they
shall
drive
thee
from
men
and
thy
dwelling
shall
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
they
shall
make
thee
to
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
seven
times
shall
pass
over
thee
until
thou
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
the
same
hour
was
the
thing
fulfilled
upon
nebuchadnezzar
and
he
was
driven
from
men
and
did
eat
grass
as
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
his
hairs
were
grown
like
eagles
feathers
and
his
nails
like
birds
claws
and
at
the
end
of
the
days
i
nebuchadnezzar
lifted
up
mine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
mine
understanding
returned
unto
me
and
i
blessed
the
most
high
and
i
praised
and
honoured
him
that
liveth
for
ever
whose
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
and
his
kingdom
is
from
generation
to
generation
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
reputed
as
nothing
and
he
doeth
according
to
his
will
in
the
army
of
heaven
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
none
can
stay
his
hand
or
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
at
the
same
time
my
reason
returned
unto
me
and
for
the
glory
of
my
kingdom
mine
honour
and
brightness
returned
unto
me
and
my
counsellors
and
my
lords
sought
unto
me
and
i
was
established
in
my
kingdom
and
excellent
majesty
was
added
unto
me
now
i
nebuchadnezzar
praise
and
extol
and
honour
the
king
of
heaven
all
whose
works
are
truth
and
his
ways
judgment
and
those
that
walk
in
pride
he
is
able
to
abase
belshazzar
the
king
made
a
great
feast
to
a
thousand
of
his
lords
and
drank
wine
before
the
thousand
belshazzar
whiles
he
tasted
the
wine
commanded
to
bring
the
golden
and
silver
vessels
which
his
father
nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
out
of
the
temple
which
was
in
jerusalem
that
the
king
and
his
princes
his
wives
and
his
concubines
might
drink
therein
then
they
brought
the
golden
vessels
that
were
taken
out
of
the
temple
of
the
house
of
god
which
was
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
and
his
princes
his
wives
and
his
concubines
drank
in
them
they
drank
wine
and
praised
the
gods
of
gold
and
of
silver
of
brass
of
iron
of
wood
and
of
stone
in
the
same
hour
came
forth
fingers
of
a
man's
hand
and
wrote
over
against
the
candlestick
upon
the
plaister
of
the
wall
of
the
king's
palace
and
the
king
saw
the
part
of
the
hand
that
wrote
then
the
king's
countenance
was
changed
and
his
thoughts
troubled
him
so
that
the
joints
of
his
loins
were
loosed
and
his
knees
smote
one
against
another
the
king
cried
aloud
to
bring
in
the
astrologers
the
chaldeans
and
the
soothsayers
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
the
wise
men
of
babylon
whosoever
shall
read
this
writing
and
shew
me
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
be
clothed
with
scarlet
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck
and
shall
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
then
came
in
all
the
king's
wise
men
but
they
could
not
read
the
writing
nor
make
known
to
the
king
the
interpretation
thereof
then
was
king
belshazzar
greatly
troubled
and
his
countenance
was
changed
in
him
and
his
lords
were
astonied
now
the
queen
by
reason
of
the
words
of
the
king
and
his
lords
came
into
the
banquet
house
and
the
queen
spake
and
said
o
king
live
for
ever
let
not
thy
thoughts
trouble
thee
nor
let
thy
countenance
be
changed
there
is
a
man
in
thy
kingdom
in
whom
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
in
the
days
of
thy
father
light
and
understanding
and
wisdom
like
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
was
found
in
him
whom
the
king
nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
the
king
i
say
thy
father
made
master
of
the
magicians
astrologers
chaldeans
and
soothsayers
forasmuch
as
an
excellent
spirit
and
knowledge
and
understanding
interpreting
of
dreams
and
shewing
of
hard
sentences
and
dissolving
of
doubts
were
found
in
the
same
daniel
whom
the
king
named
belteshazzar
now
let
daniel
be
called
and
he
will
shew
the
interpretation
then
was
daniel
brought
in
before
the
king
and
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
daniel
art
thou
that
daniel
which
art
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
judah
whom
the
king
my
father
brought
out
of
jewry
i
have
even
heard
of
thee
that
the
spirit
of
the
gods
is
in
thee
and
that
light
and
understanding
and
excellent
wisdom
is
found
in
thee
and
now
the
wise
men
the
astrologers
have
been
brought
in
before
me
that
they
should
read
this
writing
and
make
known
unto
me
the
interpretation
thereof
but
they
could
not
shew
the
interpretation
of
the
thing
and
i
have
heard
of
thee
that
thou
canst
make
interpretations
and
dissolve
doubts
now
if
thou
canst
read
the
writing
and
make
known
to
me
the
interpretation
thereof
thou
shalt
be
clothed
with
scarlet
and
have
a
chain
of
gold
about
thy
neck
and
shalt
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
then
daniel
answered
and
said
before
the
king
let
thy
gifts
be
to
thyself
and
give
thy
rewards
to
another
yet
i
will
read
the
writing
unto
the
king
and
make
known
to
him
the
interpretation
o
thou
king
the
most
high
god
gave
nebuchadnezzar
thy
father
a
kingdom
and
majesty
and
glory
and
honour
and
for
the
majesty
that
he
gave
him
all
people
nations
and
languages
trembled
and
feared
before
him
whom
he
would
he
slew
and
whom
he
would
he
kept
alive
and
whom
he
would
he
set
up
and
whom
he
would
he
put
down
but
when
his
heart
was
lifted
up
and
his
mind
hardened
in
pride
he
was
deposed
from
his
kingly
throne
and
they
took
his
glory
from
him
and
he
was
driven
from
the
sons
of
men
and
his
heart
was
made
like
the
beasts
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
asses
they
fed
him
with
grass
like
oxen
and
his
body
was
wet
with
the
dew
of
heaven
till
he
knew
that
the
most
high
god
ruled
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
that
he
appointeth
over
it
whomsoever
he
will
and
thou
his
son
o
belshazzar
hast
not
humbled
thine
heart
though
thou
knewest
all
this
but
hast
lifted
up
thyself
against
the
lord
of
heaven
and
they
have
brought
the
vessels
of
his
house
before
thee
and
thou
and
thy
lords
thy
wives
and
thy
concubines
have
drunk
wine
in
them
and
thou
hast
praised
the
gods
of
silver
and
gold
of
brass
iron
wood
and
stone
which
see
not
nor
hear
nor
know
and
the
god
in
whose
hand
thy
breath
is
and
whose
are
all
thy
ways
hast
thou
not
glorified
then
was
the
part
of
the
hand
sent
from
him
and
this
writing
was
written
and
this
is
the
writing
that
was
written
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
thing
mene
god
hath
numbered
thy
kingdom
and
finished
it
tekel
thou
art
weighed
in
the
balances
and
art
found
wanting
peres
thy
kingdom
is
divided
and
given
to
the
medes
and
persians
then
commanded
belshazzar
and
they
clothed
daniel
with
scarlet
and
put
a
chain
of
gold
about
his
neck
and
made
a
proclamation
concerning
him
that
he
should
be
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
in
that
night
was
belshazzar
the
king
of
the
chaldeans
slain
and
darius
the
median
took
the
kingdom
being
about
threescore
and
two
years
old
it
pleased
darius
to
set
over
the
kingdom
an
hundred
and
twenty
princes
which
should
be
over
the
whole
kingdom
and
over
these
three
presidents
of
whom
daniel
was
first
that
the
princes
might
give
accounts
unto
them
and
the
king
should
have
no
damage
then
this
daniel
was
preferred
above
the
presidents
and
princes
because
an
excellent
spirit
was
in
him
and
the
king
thought
to
set
him
over
the
whole
realm
then
the
presidents
and
princes
sought
to
find
occasion
against
daniel
concerning
the
kingdom
but
they
could
find
none
occasion
nor
fault
forasmuch
as
he
was
faithful
neither
was
there
any
error
or
fault
found
in
him
then
said
these
men
we
shall
not
find
any
occasion
against
this
daniel
except
we
find
it
against
him
concerning
the
law
of
his
god
then
these
presidents
and
princes
assembled
together
to
the
king
and
said
thus
unto
him
king
darius
live
for
ever
all
the
presidents
of
the
kingdom
the
governors
and
the
princes
the
counsellors
and
the
captains
have
consulted
together
to
establish
a
royal
statute
and
to
make
a
firm
decree
that
whosoever
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
god
or
man
for
thirty
days
save
of
thee
o
king
he
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions
now
o
king
establish
the
decree
and
sign
the
writing
that
it
be
not
changed
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
which
altereth
not
wherefore
king
darius
signed
the
writing
and
the
decree
now
when
daniel
knew
that
the
writing
was
signed
he
went
into
his
house
and
his
windows
being
open
in
his
chamber
toward
jerusalem
he
kneeled
upon
his
knees
three
times
a
day
and
prayed
and
gave
thanks
before
his
god
as
he
did
aforetime
then
these
men
assembled
and
found
daniel
praying
and
making
supplication
before
his
god
then
they
came
near
and
spake
before
the
king
concerning
the
king's
decree
hast
thou
not
signed
a
decree
that
every
man
that
shall
ask
a
petition
of
any
god
or
man
within
thirty
days
save
of
thee
o
king
shall
be
cast
into
the
den
of
lions
the
king
answered
and
said
the
thing
is
true
according
to
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
which
altereth
not
then
answered
they
and
said
before
the
king
that
daniel
which
is
of
the
children
of
the
captivity
of
judah
regardeth
not
thee
o
king
nor
the
decree
that
thou
hast
signed
but
maketh
his
petition
three
times
a
day
then
the
king
when
he
heard
these
words
was
sore
displeased
with
himself
and
set
his
heart
on
daniel
to
deliver
him
and
he
laboured
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
to
deliver
him
then
these
men
assembled
unto
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
know
o
king
that
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
is
that
no
decree
nor
statute
which
the
king
establisheth
may
be
changed
then
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
daniel
and
cast
him
into
the
den
of
lions
now
the
king
spake
and
said
unto
daniel
thy
god
whom
thou
servest
continually
he
will
deliver
thee
and
a
stone
was
brought
and
laid
upon
the
mouth
of
the
den
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
own
signet
and
with
the
signet
of
his
lords
that
the
purpose
might
not
be
changed
concerning
daniel
then
the
king
went
to
his
palace
and
passed
the
night
fasting
neither
were
instruments
of
musick
brought
before
him
and
his
sleep
went
from
him
then
the
king
arose
very
early
in
the
morning
and
went
in
haste
unto
the
den
of
lions
and
when
he
came
to
the
den
he
cried
with
a
lamentable
voice
unto
daniel
and
the
king
spake
and
said
to
daniel
o
daniel
servant
of
the
living
god
is
thy
god
whom
thou
servest
continually
able
to
deliver
thee
from
the
lions
then
said
daniel
unto
the
king
o
king
live
for
ever
my
god
hath
sent
his
angel
and
hath
shut
the
lions
mouths
that
they
have
not
hurt
me
forasmuch
as
before
him
innocency
was
found
in
me
and
also
before
thee
o
king
have
i
done
no
hurt
then
was
the
king
exceedingly
glad
for
him
and
commanded
that
they
should
take
daniel
up
out
of
the
den
so
daniel
was
taken
up
out
of
the
den
and
no
manner
of
hurt
was
found
upon
him
because
he
believed
in
his
god
and
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
those
men
which
had
accused
daniel
and
they
cast
them
into
the
den
of
lions
them
their
children
and
their
wives
and
the
lions
had
the
mastery
of
them
and
brake
all
their
bones
in
pieces
or
ever
they
came
at
the
bottom
of
the
den
then
king
darius
wrote
unto
all
people
nations
and
languages
that
dwell
in
all
the
earth
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
i
make
a
decree
that
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
god
of
daniel
for
he
is
the
living
god
and
stedfast
for
ever
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
and
his
dominion
shall
be
even
unto
the
end
he
delivereth
and
rescueth
and
he
worketh
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven
and
in
earth
who
hath
delivered
daniel
from
the
power
of
the
lions
so
this
daniel
prospered
in
the
reign
of
darius
and
in
the
reign
of
cyrus
the
persian
in
the
first
year
of
belshazzar
king
of
babylon
daniel
had
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
upon
his
bed
then
he
wrote
the
dream
and
told
the
sum
of
the
matters
daniel
spake
and
said
i
saw
in
my
vision
by
night
and
behold
the
four
winds
of
the
heaven
strove
upon
the
great
sea
and
four
great
beasts
came
up
from
the
sea
diverse
one
from
another
the
first
was
like
a
lion
and
had
eagle's
wings
i
beheld
till
the
wings
thereof
were
plucked
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
the
earth
and
made
stand
upon
the
feet
as
a
man
and
a
man's
heart
was
given
to
it
and
behold
another
beast
a
second
like
to
a
bear
and
it
raised
up
itself
on
one
side
and
it
had
three
ribs
in
the
mouth
of
it
between
the
teeth
of
it
and
they
said
thus
unto
it
arise
devour
much
flesh
after
this
i
beheld
and
lo
another
like
a
leopard
which
had
upon
the
back
of
it
four
wings
of
a
fowl
the
beast
had
also
four
heads
and
dominion
was
given
to
it
after
this
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
a
fourth
beast
dreadful
and
terrible
and
strong
exceedingly
and
it
had
great
iron
teeth
it
devoured
and
brake
in
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
the
feet
of
it
and
it
was
diverse
from
all
the
beasts
that
were
before
it
and
it
had
ten
horns
i
considered
the
horns
and
behold
there
came
up
among
them
another
little
horn
before
whom
there
were
three
of
the
first
horns
plucked
up
by
the
roots
and
behold
in
this
horn
were
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
man
and
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
i
beheld
till
the
thrones
were
cast
down
and
the
ancient
of
days
did
sit
whose
garment
was
white
as
snow
and
the
hair
of
his
head
like
the
pure
wool
his
throne
was
like
the
fiery
flame
and
his
wheels
as
burning
fire
a
fiery
stream
issued
and
came
forth
from
before
him
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
him
the
judgment
was
set
and
the
books
were
opened
i
beheld
then
because
of
the
voice
of
the
great
words
which
the
horn
spake
i
beheld
even
till
the
beast
was
slain
and
his
body
destroyed
and
given
to
the
burning
flame
as
concerning
the
rest
of
the
beasts
they
had
their
dominion
taken
away
yet
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
season
and
time
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
and
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
a
kingdom
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
i
daniel
was
grieved
in
my
spirit
in
the
midst
of
my
body
and
the
visions
of
my
head
troubled
me
i
came
near
unto
one
of
them
that
stood
by
and
asked
him
the
truth
of
all
this
so
he
told
me
and
made
me
know
the
interpretation
of
the
things
these
great
beasts
which
are
four
are
four
kings
which
shall
arise
out
of
the
earth
but
the
saints
of
the
most
high
shall
take
the
kingdom
and
possess
the
kingdom
for
ever
even
for
ever
and
ever
then
i
would
know
the
truth
of
the
fourth
beast
which
was
diverse
from
all
the
others
exceeding
dreadful
whose
teeth
were
of
iron
and
his
nails
of
brass
which
devoured
brake
in
pieces
and
stamped
the
residue
with
his
feet
and
of
the
ten
horns
that
were
in
his
head
and
of
the
other
which
came
up
and
before
whom
three
fell
even
of
that
horn
that
had
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
spake
very
great
things
whose
look
was
more
stout
than
his
fellows
i
beheld
and
the
same
horn
made
war
with
the
saints
and
prevailed
against
them
until
the
ancient
of
days
came
and
judgment
was
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
the
time
came
that
the
saints
possessed
the
kingdom
thus
he
said
the
fourth
beast
shall
be
the
fourth
kingdom
upon
earth
which
shall
be
diverse
from
all
kingdoms
and
shall
devour
the
whole
earth
and
shall
tread
it
down
and
break
it
in
pieces
and
the
ten
horns
out
of
this
kingdom
are
ten
kings
that
shall
arise
and
another
shall
rise
after
them
and
he
shall
be
diverse
from
the
first
and
he
shall
subdue
three
kings
and
he
shall
speak
great
words
against
the
most
high
and
shall
wear
out
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
think
to
change
times
and
laws
and
they
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
until
a
time
and
times
and
the
dividing
of
time
but
the
judgment
shall
sit
and
they
shall
take
away
his
dominion
to
consume
and
to
destroy
it
unto
the
end
and
the
kingdom
and
dominion
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heaven
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
high
whose
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
all
dominions
shall
serve
and
obey
him
hitherto
is
the
end
of
the
matter
as
for
me
daniel
my
cogitations
much
troubled
me
and
my
countenance
changed
in
me
but
i
kept
the
matter
in
my
heart
in
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
king
belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
unto
me
even
unto
me
daniel
after
that
which
appeared
unto
me
at
the
first
and
i
saw
in
a
vision
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
saw
that
i
was
at
shushan
in
the
palace
which
is
in
the
province
of
elam
and
i
saw
in
a
vision
and
i
was
by
the
river
of
ulai
then
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
saw
and
behold
there
stood
before
the
river
a
ram
which
had
two
horns
and
the
two
horns
were
high
but
one
was
higher
than
the
other
and
the
higher
came
up
last
i
saw
the
ram
pushing
westward
and
northward
and
southward
so
that
no
beasts
might
stand
before
him
neither
was
there
any
that
could
deliver
out
of
his
hand
but
he
did
according
to
his
will
and
became
great
and
as
i
was
considering
behold
an
he
goat
came
from
the
west
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
and
touched
not
the
ground
and
the
goat
had
a
notable
horn
between
his
eyes
and
he
came
to
the
ram
that
had
two
horns
which
i
had
seen
standing
before
the
river
and
ran
unto
him
in
the
fury
of
his
power
and
i
saw
him
come
close
unto
the
ram
and
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
him
and
smote
the
ram
and
brake
his
two
horns
and
there
was
no
power
in
the
ram
to
stand
before
him
but
he
cast
him
down
to
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
him
and
there
was
none
that
could
deliver
the
ram
out
of
his
hand
therefore
the
he
goat
waxed
very
great
and
when
he
was
strong
the
great
horn
was
broken
and
for
it
came
up
four
notable
ones
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
out
of
one
of
them
came
forth
a
little
horn
which
waxed
exceeding
great
toward
the
south
and
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
pleasant
land
and
it
waxed
great
even
to
the
host
of
heaven
and
it
cast
down
some
of
the
host
and
of
the
stars
to
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
them
yea
he
magnified
himself
even
to
the
prince
of
the
host
and
by
him
the
daily
sacrifice
was
taken
away
and
the
place
of
the
sanctuary
was
cast
down
and
an
host
was
given
him
against
the
daily
sacrifice
by
reason
of
transgression
and
it
cast
down
the
truth
to
the
ground
and
it
practised
and
prospered
then
i
heard
one
saint
speaking
and
another
saint
said
unto
that
certain
saint
which
spake
how
long
shall
be
the
vision
concerning
the
daily
sacrifice
and
the
transgression
of
desolation
to
give
both
the
sanctuary
and
the
host
to
be
trodden
under
foot
and
he
said
unto
me
unto
two
thousand
and
three
hundred
days
then
shall
the
sanctuary
be
cleansed
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
even
i
daniel
had
seen
the
vision
and
sought
for
the
meaning
then
behold
there
stood
before
me
as
the
appearance
of
a
man
and
i
heard
a
man's
voice
between
the
banks
of
ulai
which
called
and
said
gabriel
make
this
man
to
understand
the
vision
so
he
came
near
where
i
stood
and
when
he
came
i
was
afraid
and
fell
upon
my
face
but
he
said
unto
me
understand
o
son
of
man
for
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
be
the
vision
now
as
he
was
speaking
with
me
i
was
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
toward
the
ground
but
he
touched
me
and
set
me
upright
and
he
said
behold
i
will
make
thee
know
what
shall
be
in
the
last
end
of
the
indignation
for
at
the
time
appointed
the
end
shall
be
the
ram
which
thou
sawest
having
two
horns
are
the
kings
of
media
and
persia
and
the
rough
goat
is
the
king
of
grecia
and
the
great
horn
that
is
between
his
eyes
is
the
first
king
now
that
being
broken
whereas
four
stood
up
for
it
four
kingdoms
shall
stand
up
out
of
the
nation
but
not
in
his
power
and
in
the
latter
time
of
their
kingdom
when
the
transgressors
are
come
to
the
full
a
king
of
fierce
countenance
and
understanding
dark
sentences
shall
stand
up
and
his
power
shall
be
mighty
but
not
by
his
own
power
and
he
shall
destroy
wonderfully
and
shall
prosper
and
practise
and
shall
destroy
the
mighty
and
the
holy
people
and
through
his
policy
also
he
shall
cause
craft
to
prosper
in
his
hand
and
he
shall
magnify
himself
in
his
heart
and
by
peace
shall
destroy
many
he
shall
also
stand
up
against
the
prince
of
princes
but
he
shall
be
broken
without
hand
and
the
vision
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
which
was
told
is
true
wherefore
shut
thou
up
the
vision
for
it
shall
be
for
many
days
and
i
daniel
fainted
and
was
sick
certain
days
afterward
i
rose
up
and
did
the
king's
business
and
i
was
astonished
at
the
vision
but
none
understood
it
in
the
first
year
of
darius
the
son
of
ahasuerus
of
the
seed
of
the
medes
which
was
made
king
over
the
realm
of
the
chaldeans
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
i
daniel
understood
by
books
the
number
of
the
years
whereof
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jeremiah
the
prophet
that
he
would
accomplish
seventy
years
in
the
desolations
of
jerusalem
and
i
set
my
face
unto
the
lord
god
to
seek
by
prayer
and
supplications
with
fasting
and
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
my
god
and
made
my
confession
and
said
o
lord
the
great
and
dreadful
god
keeping
the
covenant
and
mercy
to
them
that
love
him
and
to
them
that
keep
his
commandments
we
have
sinned
and
have
committed
iniquity
and
have
done
wickedly
and
have
rebelled
even
by
departing
from
thy
precepts
and
from
thy
judgments
neither
have
we
hearkened
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets
which
spake
in
thy
name
to
our
kings
our
princes
and
our
fathers
and
to
all
the
people
of
the
land
o
lord
righteousness
belongeth
unto
thee
but
unto
us
confusion
of
faces
as
at
this
day
to
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
unto
all
israel
that
are
near
and
that
are
far
off
through
all
the
countries
whither
thou
hast
driven
them
because
of
their
trespass
that
they
have
trespassed
against
thee
o
lord
to
us
belongeth
confusion
of
face
to
our
kings
to
our
princes
and
to
our
fathers
because
we
have
sinned
against
thee
to
the
lord
our
god
belong
mercies
and
forgivenesses
though
we
have
rebelled
against
him
neither
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
to
walk
in
his
laws
which
he
set
before
us
by
his
servants
the
prophets
yea
all
israel
have
transgressed
thy
law
even
by
departing
that
they
might
not
obey
thy
voice
therefore
the
curse
is
poured
upon
us
and
the
oath
that
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
the
servant
of
god
because
we
have
sinned
against
him
and
he
hath
confirmed
his
words
which
he
spake
against
us
and
against
our
judges
that
judged
us
by
bringing
upon
us
a
great
evil
for
under
the
whole
heaven
hath
not
been
done
as
hath
been
done
upon
jerusalem
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
all
this
evil
is
come
upon
us
yet
made
we
not
our
prayer
before
the
lord
our
god
that
we
might
turn
from
our
iniquities
and
understand
thy
truth
therefore
hath
the
lord
watched
upon
the
evil
and
brought
it
upon
us
for
the
lord
our
god
is
righteous
in
all
his
works
which
he
doeth
for
we
obeyed
not
his
voice
and
now
o
lord
our
god
that
hast
brought
thy
people
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
hast
gotten
thee
renown
as
at
this
day
we
have
sinned
we
have
done
wickedly
o
lord
according
to
all
thy
righteousness
i
beseech
thee
let
thine
anger
and
thy
fury
be
turned
away
from
thy
city
jerusalem
thy
holy
mountain
because
for
our
sins
and
for
the
iniquities
of
our
fathers
jerusalem
and
thy
people
are
become
a
reproach
to
all
that
are
about
us
now
therefore
o
our
god
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
his
supplications
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
sanctuary
that
is
desolate
for
the
lord's
sake
o
my
god
incline
thine
ear
and
hear
open
thine
eyes
and
behold
our
desolations
and
the
city
which
is
called
by
thy
name
for
we
do
not
present
our
supplications
before
thee
for
our
righteousnesses
but
for
thy
great
mercies
o
lord
hear
o
lord
forgive
o
lord
hearken
and
do
defer
not
for
thine
own
sake
o
my
god
for
thy
city
and
thy
people
are
called
by
thy
name
and
whiles
i
was
speaking
and
praying
and
confessing
my
sin
and
the
sin
of
my
people
israel
and
presenting
my
supplication
before
the
lord
my
god
for
the
holy
mountain
of
my
god
yea
whiles
i
was
speaking
in
prayer
even
the
man
gabriel
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
vision
at
the
beginning
being
caused
to
fly
swiftly
touched
me
about
the
time
of
the
evening
oblation
and
he
informed
me
and
talked
with
me
and
said
o
daniel
i
am
now
come
forth
to
give
thee
skill
and
understanding
at
the
beginning
of
thy
supplications
the
commandment
came
forth
and
i
am
come
to
shew
thee
for
thou
art
greatly
beloved
therefore
understand
the
matter
and
consider
the
vision
seventy
weeks
are
determined
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
holy
city
to
finish
the
transgression
and
to
make
an
end
of
sins
and
to
make
reconciliation
for
iniquity
and
to
bring
in
everlasting
righteousness
and
to
seal
up
the
vision
and
prophecy
and
to
anoint
the
most
holy
know
therefore
and
understand
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
restore
and
to
build
jerusalem
unto
the
messiah
the
prince
shall
be
seven
weeks
and
threescore
and
two
weeks
the
street
shall
be
built
again
and
the
wall
even
in
troublous
times
and
after
threescore
and
two
weeks
shall
messiah
be
cut
off
but
not
for
himself
and
the
people
of
the
prince
that
shall
come
shall
destroy
the
city
and
the
sanctuary
and
the
end
thereof
shall
be
with
a
flood
and
unto
the
end
of
the
war
desolations
are
determined
and
he
shall
confirm
the
covenant
with
many
for
one
week
and
in
the
midst
of
the
week
he
shall
cause
the
sacrifice
and
the
oblation
to
cease
and
for
the
overspreading
of
abominations
he
shall
make
it
desolate
even
until
the
consummation
and
that
determined
shall
be
poured
upon
the
desolate
in
the
third
year
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
a
thing
was
revealed
unto
daniel
whose
name
was
called
belteshazzar
and
the
thing
was
true
but
the
time
appointed
was
long
and
he
understood
the
thing
and
had
understanding
of
the
vision
in
those
days
i
daniel
was
mourning
three
full
weeks
i
ate
no
pleasant
bread
neither
came
flesh
nor
wine
in
my
mouth
neither
did
i
anoint
myself
at
all
till
three
whole
weeks
were
fulfilled
and
in
the
four
and
twentieth
day
of
the
first
month
as
i
was
by
the
side
of
the
great
river
which
is
hiddekel
then
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
certain
man
clothed
in
linen
whose
loins
were
girded
with
fine
gold
of
uphaz
his
body
also
was
like
the
beryl
and
his
face
as
the
appearance
of
lightning
and
his
eyes
as
lamps
of
fire
and
his
arms
and
his
feet
like
in
colour
to
polished
brass
and
the
voice
of
his
words
like
the
voice
of
a
multitude
and
i
daniel
alone
saw
the
vision
for
the
men
that
were
with
me
saw
not
the
vision
but
a
great
quaking
fell
upon
them
so
that
they
fled
to
hide
themselves
therefore
i
was
left
alone
and
saw
this
great
vision
and
there
remained
no
strength
in
me
for
my
comeliness
was
turned
in
me
into
corruption
and
i
retained
no
strength
yet
heard
i
the
voice
of
his
words
and
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
his
words
then
was
i
in
a
deep
sleep
on
my
face
and
my
face
toward
the
ground
and
behold
an
hand
touched
me
which
set
me
upon
my
knees
and
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
he
said
unto
me
o
daniel
a
man
greatly
beloved
understand
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
thee
and
stand
upright
for
unto
thee
am
i
now
sent
and
when
he
had
spoken
this
word
unto
me
i
stood
trembling
then
said
he
unto
me
fear
not
daniel
for
from
the
first
day
that
thou
didst
set
thine
heart
to
understand
and
to
chasten
thyself
before
thy
god
thy
words
were
heard
and
i
am
come
for
thy
words
but
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
withstood
me
one
and
twenty
days
but
lo
michael
one
of
the
chief
princes
came
to
help
me
and
i
remained
there
with
the
kings
of
persia
now
i
am
come
to
make
thee
understand
what
shall
befall
thy
people
in
the
latter
days
for
yet
the
vision
is
for
many
days
and
when
he
had
spoken
such
words
unto
me
i
set
my
face
toward
the
ground
and
i
became
dumb
and
behold
one
like
the
similitude
of
the
sons
of
men
touched
my
lips
then
i
opened
my
mouth
and
spake
and
said
unto
him
that
stood
before
me
o
my
lord
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
me
and
i
have
retained
no
strength
for
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
lord
for
as
for
me
straightway
there
remained
no
strength
in
me
neither
is
there
breath
left
in
me
then
there
came
again
and
touched
me
one
like
the
appearance
of
a
man
and
he
strengthened
me
and
said
o
man
greatly
beloved
fear
not
peace
be
unto
thee
be
strong
yea
be
strong
and
when
he
had
spoken
unto
me
i
was
strengthened
and
said
let
my
lord
speak
for
thou
hast
strengthened
me
then
said
he
knowest
thou
wherefore
i
come
unto
thee
and
now
will
i
return
to
fight
with
the
prince
of
persia
and
when
i
am
gone
forth
lo
the
prince
of
grecia
shall
come
but
i
will
shew
thee
that
which
is
noted
in
the
scripture
of
truth
and
there
is
none
that
holdeth
with
me
in
these
things
but
michael
your
prince
also
i
in
the
first
year
of
darius
the
mede
even
i
stood
to
confirm
and
to
strengthen
him
and
now
will
i
shew
thee
the
truth
behold
there
shall
stand
up
yet
three
kings
in
persia
and
the
fourth
shall
be
far
richer
than
they
all
and
by
his
strength
through
his
riches
he
shall
stir
up
all
against
the
realm
of
grecia
and
a
mighty
king
shall
stand
up
that
shall
rule
with
great
dominion
and
do
according
to
his
will
and
when
he
shall
stand
up
his
kingdom
shall
be
broken
and
shall
be
divided
toward
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
not
to
his
posterity
nor
according
to
his
dominion
which
he
ruled
for
his
kingdom
shall
be
plucked
up
even
for
others
beside
those
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
strong
and
one
of
his
princes
and
he
shall
be
strong
above
him
and
have
dominion
his
dominion
shall
be
a
great
dominion
and
in
the
end
of
years
they
shall
join
themselves
together
for
the
king's
daughter
of
the
south
shall
come
to
the
king
of
the
north
to
make
an
agreement
but
she
shall
not
retain
the
power
of
the
arm
neither
shall
he
stand
nor
his
arm
but
she
shall
be
given
up
and
they
that
brought
her
and
he
that
begat
her
and
he
that
strengthened
her
in
these
times
but
out
of
a
branch
of
her
roots
shall
one
stand
up
in
his
estate
which
shall
come
with
an
army
and
shall
enter
into
the
fortress
of
the
king
of
the
north
and
shall
deal
against
them
and
shall
prevail
and
shall
also
carry
captives
into
egypt
their
gods
with
their
princes
and
with
their
precious
vessels
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
he
shall
continue
more
years
than
the
king
of
the
north
so
the
king
of
the
south
shall
come
into
his
kingdom
and
shall
return
into
his
own
land
but
his
sons
shall
be
stirred
up
and
shall
assemble
a
multitude
of
great
forces
and
one
shall
certainly
come
and
overflow
and
pass
through
then
shall
he
return
and
be
stirred
up
even
to
his
fortress
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
moved
with
choler
and
shall
come
forth
and
fight
with
him
even
with
the
king
of
the
north
and
he
shall
set
forth
a
great
multitude
but
the
multitude
shall
be
given
into
his
hand
and
when
he
hath
taken
away
the
multitude
his
heart
shall
be
lifted
up
and
he
shall
cast
down
many
ten
thousands
but
he
shall
not
be
strengthened
by
it
for
the
king
of
the
north
shall
return
and
shall
set
forth
a
multitude
greater
than
the
former
and
shall
certainly
come
after
certain
years
with
a
great
army
and
with
much
riches
and
in
those
times
there
shall
many
stand
up
against
the
king
of
the
south
also
the
robbers
of
thy
people
shall
exalt
themselves
to
establish
the
vision
but
they
shall
fall
so
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come
and
cast
up
a
mount
and
take
the
most
fenced
cities
and
the
arms
of
the
south
shall
not
withstand
neither
his
chosen
people
neither
shall
there
be
any
strength
to
withstand
but
he
that
cometh
against
him
shall
do
according
to
his
own
will
and
none
shall
stand
before
him
and
he
shall
stand
in
the
glorious
land
which
by
his
hand
shall
be
consumed
he
shall
also
set
his
face
to
enter
with
the
strength
of
his
whole
kingdom
and
upright
ones
with
him
thus
shall
he
do
and
he
shall
give
him
the
daughter
of
women
corrupting
her
but
she
shall
not
stand
on
his
side
neither
be
for
him
after
this
shall
he
turn
his
face
unto
the
isles
and
shall
take
many
but
a
prince
for
his
own
behalf
shall
cause
the
reproach
offered
by
him
to
cease
without
his
own
reproach
he
shall
cause
it
to
turn
upon
him
then
he
shall
turn
his
face
toward
the
fort
of
his
own
land
but
he
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
not
be
found
then
shall
stand
up
in
his
estate
a
raiser
of
taxes
in
the
glory
of
the
kingdom
but
within
few
days
he
shall
be
destroyed
neither
in
anger
nor
in
battle
and
in
his
estate
shall
stand
up
a
vile
person
to
whom
they
shall
not
give
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
but
he
shall
come
in
peaceably
and
obtain
the
kingdom
by
flatteries
and
with
the
arms
of
a
flood
shall
they
be
overflown
from
before
him
and
shall
be
broken
yea
also
the
prince
of
the
covenant
and
after
the
league
made
with
him
he
shall
work
deceitfully
for
he
shall
come
up
and
shall
become
strong
with
a
small
people
he
shall
enter
peaceably
even
upon
the
fattest
places
of
the
province
and
he
shall
do
that
which
his
fathers
have
not
done
nor
his
fathers
fathers
he
shall
scatter
among
them
the
prey
and
spoil
and
riches
yea
and
he
shall
forecast
his
devices
against
the
strong
holds
even
for
a
time
and
he
shall
stir
up
his
power
and
his
courage
against
the
king
of
the
south
with
a
great
army
and
the
king
of
the
south
shall
be
stirred
up
to
battle
with
a
very
great
and
mighty
army
but
he
shall
not
stand
for
they
shall
forecast
devices
against
him
yea
they
that
feed
of
the
portion
of
his
meat
shall
destroy
him
and
his
army
shall
overflow
and
many
shall
fall
down
slain
and
both
of
these
kings
hearts
shall
be
to
do
mischief
and
they
shall
speak
lies
at
one
table
but
it
shall
not
prosper
for
yet
the
end
shall
be
at
the
time
appointed
then
shall
he
return
into
his
land
with
great
riches
and
his
heart
shall
be
against
the
holy
covenant
and
he
shall
do
exploits
and
return
to
his
own
land
at
the
time
appointed
he
shall
return
and
come
toward
the
south
but
it
shall
not
be
as
the
former
or
as
the
latter
for
the
ships
of
chittim
shall
come
against
him
therefore
he
shall
be
grieved
and
return
and
have
indignation
against
the
holy
covenant
so
shall
he
do
he
shall
even
return
and
have
intelligence
with
them
that
forsake
the
holy
covenant
and
arms
shall
stand
on
his
part
and
they
shall
pollute
the
sanctuary
of
strength
and
shall
take
away
the
daily
sacrifice
and
they
shall
place
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
and
such
as
do
wickedly
against
the
covenant
shall
he
corrupt
by
flatteries
but
the
people
that
do
know
their
god
shall
be
strong
and
do
exploits
and
they
that
understand
among
the
people
shall
instruct
many
yet
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
by
flame
by
captivity
and
by
spoil
many
days
now
when
they
shall
fall
they
shall
be
holpen
with
a
little
help
but
many
shall
cleave
to
them
with
flatteries
and
some
of
them
of
understanding
shall
fall
to
try
them
and
to
purge
and
to
make
them
white
even
to
the
time
of
the
end
because
it
is
yet
for
a
time
appointed
and
the
king
shall
do
according
to
his
will
and
he
shall
exalt
himself
and
magnify
himself
above
every
god
and
shall
speak
marvellous
things
against
the
god
of
gods
and
shall
prosper
till
the
indignation
be
accomplished
for
that
that
is
determined
shall
be
done
neither
shall
he
regard
the
god
of
his
fathers
nor
the
desire
of
women
nor
regard
any
god
for
he
shall
magnify
himself
above
all
but
in
his
estate
shall
he
honour
the
god
of
forces
and
a
god
whom
his
fathers
knew
not
shall
he
honour
with
gold
and
silver
and
with
precious
stones
and
pleasant
things
thus
shall
he
do
in
the
most
strong
holds
with
a
strange
god
whom
he
shall
acknowledge
and
increase
with
glory
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
rule
over
many
and
shall
divide
the
land
for
gain
and
at
the
time
of
the
end
shall
the
king
of
the
south
push
at
him
and
the
king
of
the
north
shall
come
against
him
like
a
whirlwind
with
chariots
and
with
horsemen
and
with
many
ships
and
he
shall
enter
into
the
countries
and
shall
overflow
and
pass
over
he
shall
enter
also
into
the
glorious
land
and
many
countries
shall
be
overthrown
but
these
shall
escape
out
of
his
hand
even
edom
and
moab
and
the
chief
of
the
children
of
ammon
he
shall
stretch
forth
his
hand
also
upon
the
countries
and
the
land
of
egypt
shall
not
escape
but
he
shall
have
power
over
the
treasures
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
over
all
the
precious
things
of
egypt
and
the
libyans
and
the
ethiopians
shall
be
at
his
steps
but
tidings
out
of
the
east
and
out
of
the
north
shall
trouble
him
therefore
he
shall
go
forth
with
great
fury
to
destroy
and
utterly
to
make
away
many
and
he
shall
plant
the
tabernacles
of
his
palace
between
the
seas
in
the
glorious
holy
mountain
yet
he
shall
come
to
his
end
and
none
shall
help
him
and
at
that
time
shall
michael
stand
up
the
great
prince
which
standeth
for
the
children
of
thy
people
and
there
shall
be
a
time
of
trouble
such
as
never
was
since
there
was
a
nation
even
to
that
same
time
and
at
that
time
thy
people
shall
be
delivered
every
one
that
shall
be
found
written
in
the
book
and
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake
some
to
everlasting
life
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
contempt
and
they
that
be
wise
shall
shine
as
the
brightness
of
the
firmament
and
they
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
as
the
stars
for
ever
and
ever
but
thou
o
daniel
shut
up
the
words
and
seal
the
book
even
to
the
time
of
the
end
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
shall
be
increased
then
i
daniel
looked
and
behold
there
stood
other
two
the
one
on
this
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river
and
the
other
on
that
side
of
the
bank
of
the
river
and
one
said
to
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
how
long
shall
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
wonders
and
i
heard
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
when
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
unto
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
that
it
shall
be
for
a
time
times
and
an
half
and
when
he
shall
have
accomplished
to
scatter
the
power
of
the
holy
people
all
these
things
shall
be
finished
and
i
heard
but
i
understood
not
then
said
i
o
my
lord
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
and
he
said
go
thy
way
daniel
for
the
words
are
closed
up
and
sealed
till
the
time
of
the
end
many
shall
be
purified
and
made
white
and
tried
but
the
wicked
shall
do
wickedly
and
none
of
the
wicked
shall
understand
but
the
wise
shall
understand
and
from
the
time
that
the
daily
sacrifice
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
abomination
that
maketh
desolate
set
up
there
shall
be
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
days
blessed
is
he
that
waiteth
and
cometh
to
the
thousand
three
hundred
and
five
and
thirty
days
but
go
thou
thy
way
till
the
end
be
for
thou
shalt
rest
and
stand
in
thy
lot
at
the
end
of
the
days
hosea
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
unto
hosea
the
son
of
beeri
in
the
days
of
uzziah
jotham
ahaz
and
hezekiah
kings
of
judah
and
in
the
days
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of
israel
the
beginning
of
the
word
of
the
lord
by
hosea
and
the
lord
said
to
hosea
go
take
unto
thee
a
wife
of
whoredoms
and
children
of
whoredoms
for
the
land
hath
committed
great
whoredom
departing
from
the
lord
so
he
went
and
took
gomer
the
daughter
of
diblaim
which
conceived
and
bare
him
a
son
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
call
his
name
jezreel
for
yet
a
little
while
and
i
will
avenge
the
blood
of
jezreel
upon
the
house
of
jehu
and
will
cause
to
cease
the
kingdom
of
the
house
of
israel
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day
that
i
will
break
the
bow
of
israel
in
the
valley
of
jezreel
and
she
conceived
again
and
bare
a
daughter
and
god
said
unto
him
call
her
name
loruhamah
for
i
will
no
more
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
israel
but
i
will
utterly
take
them
away
but
i
will
have
mercy
upon
the
house
of
judah
and
will
save
them
by
the
lord
their
god
and
will
not
save
them
by
bow
nor
by
sword
nor
by
battle
by
horses
nor
by
horsemen
now
when
she
had
weaned
loruhamah
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
then
said
god
call
his
name
loammi
for
ye
are
not
my
people
and
i
will
not
be
your
god
yet
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
which
cannot
be
measured
nor
numbered
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them
ye
are
not
my
people
there
it
shall
be
said
unto
them
ye
are
the
sons
of
the
living
god
then
shall
the
children
of
judah
and
the
children
of
israel
be
gathered
together
and
appoint
themselves
one
head
and
they
shall
come
up
out
of
the
land
for
great
shall
be
the
day
of
jezreel
say
ye
unto
your
brethren
ammi
and
to
your
sisters
ruhamah
plead
with
your
mother
plead
for
she
is
not
my
wife
neither
am
i
her
husband
let
her
therefore
put
away
her
whoredoms
out
of
her
sight
and
her
adulteries
from
between
her
breasts
lest
i
strip
her
naked
and
set
her
as
in
the
day
that
she
was
born
and
make
her
as
a
wilderness
and
set
her
like
a
dry
land
and
slay
her
with
thirst
and
i
will
not
have
mercy
upon
her
children
for
they
be
the
children
of
whoredoms
for
their
mother
hath
played
the
harlot
she
that
conceived
them
hath
done
shamefully
for
she
said
i
will
go
after
my
lovers
that
give
me
my
bread
and
my
water
my
wool
and
my
flax
mine
oil
and
my
drink
therefore
behold
i
will
hedge
up
thy
way
with
thorns
and
make
a
wall
that
she
shall
not
find
her
paths
and
she
shall
follow
after
her
lovers
but
she
shall
not
overtake
them
and
she
shall
seek
them
but
shall
not
find
them
then
shall
she
say
i
will
go
and
return
to
my
first
husband
for
then
was
it
better
with
me
than
now
for
she
did
not
know
that
i
gave
her
corn
and
wine
and
oil
and
multiplied
her
silver
and
gold
which
they
prepared
for
baal
therefore
will
i
return
and
take
away
my
corn
in
the
time
thereof
and
my
wine
in
the
season
thereof
and
will
recover
my
wool
and
my
flax
given
to
cover
her
nakedness
and
now
will
i
discover
her
lewdness
in
the
sight
of
her
lovers
and
none
shall
deliver
her
out
of
mine
hand
i
will
also
cause
all
her
mirth
to
cease
her
feast
days
her
new
moons
and
her
sabbaths
and
all
her
solemn
feasts
and
i
will
destroy
her
vines
and
her
fig
trees
whereof
she
hath
said
these
are
my
rewards
that
my
lovers
have
given
me
and
i
will
make
them
a
forest
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
eat
them
and
i
will
visit
upon
her
the
days
of
baalim
wherein
she
burned
incense
to
them
and
she
decked
herself
with
her
earrings
and
her
jewels
and
she
went
after
her
lovers
and
forgat
me
saith
the
lord
therefore
behold
i
will
allure
her
and
bring
her
into
the
wilderness
and
speak
comfortably
unto
her
and
i
will
give
her
her
vineyards
from
thence
and
the
valley
of
achor
for
a
door
of
hope
and
she
shall
sing
there
as
in
the
days
of
her
youth
and
as
in
the
day
when
she
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
it
shall
be
at
that
day
saith
the
lord
that
thou
shalt
call
me
ishi
and
shalt
call
me
no
more
baali
for
i
will
take
away
the
names
of
baalim
out
of
her
mouth
and
they
shall
no
more
be
remembered
by
their
name
and
in
that
day
will
i
make
a
covenant
for
them
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
with
the
fowls
of
heaven
and
with
the
creeping
things
of
the
ground
and
i
will
break
the
bow
and
the
sword
and
the
battle
out
of
the
earth
and
will
make
them
to
lie
down
safely
and
i
will
betroth
thee
unto
me
for
ever
yea
i
will
betroth
thee
unto
me
in
righteousness
and
in
judgment
and
in
lovingkindness
and
in
mercies
i
will
even
betroth
thee
unto
me
in
faithfulness
and
thou
shalt
know
the
lord
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
i
will
hear
saith
the
lord
i
will
hear
the
heavens
and
they
shall
hear
the
earth
and
the
earth
shall
hear
the
corn
and
the
wine
and
the
oil
and
they
shall
hear
jezreel
and
i
will
sow
her
unto
me
in
the
earth
and
i
will
have
mercy
upon
her
that
had
not
obtained
mercy
and
i
will
say
to
them
which
were
not
my
people
thou
art
my
people
and
they
shall
say
thou
art
my
god
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
go
yet
love
a
woman
beloved
of
her
friend
yet
an
adulteress
according
to
the
love
of
the
lord
toward
the
children
of
israel
who
look
to
other
gods
and
love
flagons
of
wine
so
i
bought
her
to
me
for
fifteen
pieces
of
silver
and
for
an
homer
of
barley
and
an
half
homer
of
barley
and
i
said
unto
her
thou
shalt
abide
for
me
many
days
thou
shalt
not
play
the
harlot
and
thou
shalt
not
be
for
another
man
so
will
i
also
be
for
thee
for
the
children
of
israel
shall
abide
many
days
without
a
king
and
without
a
prince
and
without
a
sacrifice
and
without
an
image
and
without
an
ephod
and
without
teraphim
afterward
shall
the
children
of
israel
return
and
seek
the
lord
their
god
and
david
their
king
and
shall
fear
the
lord
and
his
goodness
in
the
latter
days
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
children
of
israel
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
because
there
is
no
truth
nor
mercy
nor
knowledge
of
god
in
the
land
by
swearing
and
lying
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
they
break
out
and
blood
toucheth
blood
therefore
shall
the
land
mourn
and
every
one
that
dwelleth
therein
shall
languish
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
with
the
fowls
of
heaven
yea
the
fishes
of
the
sea
also
shall
be
taken
away
yet
let
no
man
strive
nor
reprove
another
for
thy
people
are
as
they
that
strive
with
the
priest
therefore
shalt
thou
fall
in
the
day
and
the
prophet
also
shall
fall
with
thee
in
the
night
and
i
will
destroy
thy
mother
my
people
are
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
because
thou
hast
rejected
knowledge
i
will
also
reject
thee
that
thou
shalt
be
no
priest
to
me
seeing
thou
hast
forgotten
the
law
of
thy
god
i
will
also
forget
thy
children
as
they
were
increased
so
they
sinned
against
me
therefore
will
i
change
their
glory
into
shame
they
eat
up
the
sin
of
my
people
and
they
set
their
heart
on
their
iniquity
and
there
shall
be
like
people
like
priest
and
i
will
punish
them
for
their
ways
and
reward
them
their
doings
for
they
shall
eat
and
not
have
enough
they
shall
commit
whoredom
and
shall
not
increase
because
they
have
left
off
to
take
heed
to
the
lord
whoredom
and
wine
and
new
wine
take
away
the
heart
my
people
ask
counsel
at
their
stocks
and
their
staff
declareth
unto
them
for
the
spirit
of
whoredoms
hath
caused
them
to
err
and
they
have
gone
a
whoring
from
under
their
god
they
sacrifice
upon
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
burn
incense
upon
the
hills
under
oaks
and
poplars
and
elms
because
the
shadow
thereof
is
good
therefore
your
daughters
shall
commit
whoredom
and
your
spouses
shall
commit
adultery
i
will
not
punish
your
daughters
when
they
commit
whoredom
nor
your
spouses
when
they
commit
adultery
for
themselves
are
separated
with
whores
and
they
sacrifice
with
harlots
therefore
the
people
that
doth
not
understand
shall
fall
though
thou
israel
play
the
harlot
yet
let
not
judah
offend
and
come
not
ye
unto
gilgal
neither
go
ye
up
to
bethaven
nor
swear
the
lord
liveth
for
israel
slideth
back
as
a
backsliding
heifer
now
the
lord
will
feed
them
as
a
lamb
in
a
large
place
ephraim
is
joined
to
idols
let
him
alone
their
drink
is
sour
they
have
committed
whoredom
continually
her
rulers
with
shame
do
love
give
ye
the
wind
hath
bound
her
up
in
her
wings
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
because
of
their
sacrifices
hear
ye
this
o
priests
and
hearken
ye
house
of
israel
and
give
ye
ear
o
house
of
the
king
for
judgment
is
toward
you
because
ye
have
been
a
snare
on
mizpah
and
a
net
spread
upon
tabor
and
the
revolters
are
profound
to
make
slaughter
though
i
have
been
a
rebuker
of
them
all
i
know
ephraim
and
israel
is
not
hid
from
me
for
now
o
ephraim
thou
committest
whoredom
and
israel
is
defiled
they
will
not
frame
their
doings
to
turn
unto
their
god
for
the
spirit
of
whoredoms
is
in
the
midst
of
them
and
they
have
not
known
the
lord
and
the
pride
of
israel
doth
testify
to
his
face
therefore
shall
israel
and
ephraim
fall
in
their
iniquity
judah
also
shall
fall
with
them
they
shall
go
with
their
flocks
and
with
their
herds
to
seek
the
lord
but
they
shall
not
find
him
he
hath
withdrawn
himself
from
them
they
have
dealt
treacherously
against
the
lord
for
they
have
begotten
strange
children
now
shall
a
month
devour
them
with
their
portions
blow
ye
the
cornet
in
gibeah
and
the
trumpet
in
ramah
cry
aloud
at
bethaven
after
thee
o
benjamin
ephraim
shall
be
desolate
in
the
day
of
rebuke
among
the
tribes
of
israel
have
i
made
known
that
which
shall
surely
be
the
princes
of
judah
were
like
them
that
remove
the
bound
therefore
i
will
pour
out
my
wrath
upon
them
like
water
ephraim
is
oppressed
and
broken
in
judgment
because
he
willingly
walked
after
the
commandment
therefore
will
i
be
unto
ephraim
as
a
moth
and
to
the
house
of
judah
as
rottenness
when
ephraim
saw
his
sickness
and
judah
saw
his
wound
then
went
ephraim
to
the
assyrian
and
sent
to
king
jareb
yet
could
he
not
heal
you
nor
cure
you
of
your
wound
for
i
will
be
unto
ephraim
as
a
lion
and
as
a
young
lion
to
the
house
of
judah
i
even
i
will
tear
and
go
away
i
will
take
away
and
none
shall
rescue
him
i
will
go
and
return
to
my
place
till
they
acknowledge
their
offence
and
seek
my
face
in
their
affliction
they
will
seek
me
early
come
and
let
us
return
unto
the
lord
for
he
hath
torn
and
he
will
heal
us
he
hath
smitten
and
he
will
bind
us
up
after
two
days
will
he
revive
us
in
the
third
day
he
will
raise
us
up
and
we
shall
live
in
his
sight
then
shall
we
know
if
we
follow
on
to
know
the
lord
his
going
forth
is
prepared
as
the
morning
and
he
shall
come
unto
us
as
the
rain
as
the
latter
and
former
rain
unto
the
earth
o
ephraim
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
o
judah
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
for
your
goodness
is
as
a
morning
cloud
and
as
the
early
dew
it
goeth
away
therefore
have
i
hewed
them
by
the
prophets
i
have
slain
them
by
the
words
of
my
mouth
and
thy
judgments
are
as
the
light
that
goeth
forth
for
i
desired
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
and
the
knowledge
of
god
more
than
burnt
offerings
but
they
like
men
have
transgressed
the
covenant
there
have
they
dealt
treacherously
against
me
gilead
is
a
city
of
them
that
work
iniquity
and
is
polluted
with
blood
and
as
troops
of
robbers
wait
for
a
man
so
the
company
of
priests
murder
in
the
way
by
consent
for
they
commit
lewdness
i
have
seen
an
horrible
thing
in
the
house
of
israel
there
is
the
whoredom
of
ephraim
israel
is
defiled
also
o
judah
he
hath
set
an
harvest
for
thee
when
i
returned
the
captivity
of
my
people
when
i
would
have
healed
israel
then
the
iniquity
of
ephraim
was
discovered
and
the
wickedness
of
samaria
for
they
commit
falsehood
and
the
thief
cometh
in
and
the
troop
of
robbers
spoileth
without
and
they
consider
not
in
their
hearts
that
i
remember
all
their
wickedness
now
their
own
doings
have
beset
them
about
they
are
before
my
face
they
make
the
king
glad
with
their
wickedness
and
the
princes
with
their
lies
they
are
all
adulterers
as
an
oven
heated
by
the
baker
who
ceaseth
from
raising
after
he
hath
kneaded
the
dough
until
it
be
leavened
in
the
day
of
our
king
the
princes
have
made
him
sick
with
bottles
of
wine
he
stretched
out
his
hand
with
scorners
for
they
have
made
ready
their
heart
like
an
oven
whiles
they
lie
in
wait
their
baker
sleepeth
all
the
night
in
the
morning
it
burneth
as
a
flaming
fire
they
are
all
hot
as
an
oven
and
have
devoured
their
judges
all
their
kings
are
fallen
there
is
none
among
them
that
calleth
unto
me
ephraim
he
hath
mixed
himself
among
the
people
ephraim
is
a
cake
not
turned
strangers
have
devoured
his
strength
and
he
knoweth
it
not
yea
gray
hairs
are
here
and
there
upon
him
yet
he
knoweth
not
and
the
pride
of
israel
testifieth
to
his
face
and
they
do
not
return
to
the
lord
their
god
nor
seek
him
for
all
this
ephraim
also
is
like
a
silly
dove
without
heart
they
call
to
egypt
they
go
to
assyria
when
they
shall
go
i
will
spread
my
net
upon
them
i
will
bring
them
down
as
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
i
will
chastise
them
as
their
congregation
hath
heard
woe
unto
them
for
they
have
fled
from
me
destruction
unto
them
because
they
have
transgressed
against
me
though
i
have
redeemed
them
yet
they
have
spoken
lies
against
me
and
they
have
not
cried
unto
me
with
their
heart
when
they
howled
upon
their
beds
they
assemble
themselves
for
corn
and
wine
and
they
rebel
against
me
though
i
have
bound
and
strengthened
their
arms
yet
do
they
imagine
mischief
against
me
they
return
but
not
to
the
most
high
they
are
like
a
deceitful
bow
their
princes
shall
fall
by
the
sword
for
the
rage
of
their
tongue
this
shall
be
their
derision
in
the
land
of
egypt
set
the
trumpet
to
thy
mouth
he
shall
come
as
an
eagle
against
the
house
of
the
lord
because
they
have
transgressed
my
covenant
and
trespassed
against
my
law
israel
shall
cry
unto
me
my
god
we
know
thee
israel
hath
cast
off
the
thing
that
is
good
the
enemy
shall
pursue
him
they
have
set
up
kings
but
not
by
me
they
have
made
princes
and
i
knew
it
not
of
their
silver
and
their
gold
have
they
made
them
idols
that
they
may
be
cut
off
thy
calf
o
samaria
hath
cast
thee
off
mine
anger
is
kindled
against
them
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
attain
to
innocency
for
from
israel
was
it
also
the
workman
made
it
therefore
it
is
not
god
but
the
calf
of
samaria
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
for
they
have
sown
the
wind
and
they
shall
reap
the
whirlwind
it
hath
no
stalk
the
bud
shall
yield
no
meal
if
so
be
it
yield
the
strangers
shall
swallow
it
up
israel
is
swallowed
up
now
shall
they
be
among
the
gentiles
as
a
vessel
wherein
is
no
pleasure
for
they
are
gone
up
to
assyria
a
wild
ass
alone
by
himself
ephraim
hath
hired
lovers
yea
though
they
have
hired
among
the
nations
now
will
i
gather
them
and
they
shall
sorrow
a
little
for
the
burden
of
the
king
of
princes
because
ephraim
hath
made
many
altars
to
sin
altars
shall
be
unto
him
to
sin
i
have
written
to
him
the
great
things
of
my
law
but
they
were
counted
as
a
strange
thing
they
sacrifice
flesh
for
the
sacrifices
of
mine
offerings
and
eat
it
but
the
lord
accepteth
them
not
now
will
he
remember
their
iniquity
and
visit
their
sins
they
shall
return
to
egypt
for
israel
hath
forgotten
his
maker
and
buildeth
temples
and
judah
hath
multiplied
fenced
cities
but
i
will
send
a
fire
upon
his
cities
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
thereof
rejoice
not
o
israel
for
joy
as
other
people
for
thou
hast
gone
a
whoring
from
thy
god
thou
hast
loved
a
reward
upon
every
cornfloor
the
floor
and
the
winepress
shall
not
feed
them
and
the
new
wine
shall
fail
in
her
they
shall
not
dwell
in
the
lord's
land
but
ephraim
shall
return
to
egypt
and
they
shall
eat
unclean
things
in
assyria
they
shall
not
offer
wine
offerings
to
the
lord
neither
shall
they
be
pleasing
unto
him
their
sacrifices
shall
be
unto
them
as
the
bread
of
mourners
all
that
eat
thereof
shall
be
polluted
for
their
bread
for
their
soul
shall
not
come
into
the
house
of
the
lord
what
will
ye
do
in
the
solemn
day
and
in
the
day
of
the
feast
of
the
lord
for
lo
they
are
gone
because
of
destruction
egypt
shall
gather
them
up
memphis
shall
bury
them
the
pleasant
places
for
their
silver
nettles
shall
possess
them
thorns
shall
be
in
their
tabernacles
the
days
of
visitation
are
come
the
days
of
recompence
are
come
israel
shall
know
it
the
prophet
is
a
fool
the
spiritual
man
is
mad
for
the
multitude
of
thine
iniquity
and
the
great
hatred
the
watchman
of
ephraim
was
with
my
god
but
the
prophet
is
a
snare
of
a
fowler
in
all
his
ways
and
hatred
in
the
house
of
his
god
they
have
deeply
corrupted
themselves
as
in
the
days
of
gibeah
therefore
he
will
remember
their
iniquity
he
will
visit
their
sins
i
found
israel
like
grapes
in
the
wilderness
i
saw
your
fathers
as
the
firstripe
in
the
fig
tree
at
her
first
time
but
they
went
to
baalpeor
and
separated
themselves
unto
that
shame
and
their
abominations
were
according
as
they
loved
as
for
ephraim
their
glory
shall
fly
away
like
a
bird
from
the
birth
and
from
the
womb
and
from
the
conception
though
they
bring
up
their
children
yet
will
i
bereave
them
that
there
shall
not
be
a
man
left
yea
woe
also
to
them
when
i
depart
from
them
ephraim
as
i
saw
tyrus
is
planted
in
a
pleasant
place
but
ephraim
shall
bring
forth
his
children
to
the
murderer
give
them
o
lord
what
wilt
thou
give
give
them
a
miscarrying
womb
and
dry
breasts
all
their
wickedness
is
in
gilgal
for
there
i
hated
them
for
the
wickedness
of
their
doings
i
will
drive
them
out
of
mine
house
i
will
love
them
no
more
all
their
princes
are
revolters
ephraim
is
smitten
their
root
is
dried
up
they
shall
bear
no
fruit
yea
though
they
bring
forth
yet
will
i
slay
even
the
beloved
fruit
of
their
womb
my
god
will
cast
them
away
because
they
did
not
hearken
unto
him
and
they
shall
be
wanderers
among
the
nations
israel
is
an
empty
vine
he
bringeth
forth
fruit
unto
himself
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
fruit
he
hath
increased
the
altars
according
to
the
goodness
of
his
land
they
have
made
goodly
images
their
heart
is
divided
now
shall
they
be
found
faulty
he
shall
break
down
their
altars
he
shall
spoil
their
images
for
now
they
shall
say
we
have
no
king
because
we
feared
not
the
lord
what
then
should
a
king
do
to
us
they
have
spoken
words
swearing
falsely
in
making
a
covenant
thus
judgment
springeth
up
as
hemlock
in
the
furrows
of
the
field
the
inhabitants
of
samaria
shall
fear
because
of
the
calves
of
bethaven
for
the
people
thereof
shall
mourn
over
it
and
the
priests
thereof
that
rejoiced
on
it
for
the
glory
thereof
because
it
is
departed
from
it
it
shall
be
also
carried
unto
assyria
for
a
present
to
king
jareb
ephraim
shall
receive
shame
and
israel
shall
be
ashamed
of
his
own
counsel
as
for
samaria
her
king
is
cut
off
as
the
foam
upon
the
water
the
high
places
also
of
aven
the
sin
of
israel
shall
be
destroyed
the
thorn
and
the
thistle
shall
come
up
on
their
altars
and
they
shall
say
to
the
mountains
cover
us
and
to
the
hills
fall
on
us
o
israel
thou
hast
sinned
from
the
days
of
gibeah
there
they
stood
the
battle
in
gibeah
against
the
children
of
iniquity
did
not
overtake
them
it
is
in
my
desire
that
i
should
chastise
them
and
the
people
shall
be
gathered
against
them
when
they
shall
bind
themselves
in
their
two
furrows
and
ephraim
is
as
an
heifer
that
is
taught
and
loveth
to
tread
out
the
corn
but
i
passed
over
upon
her
fair
neck
i
will
make
ephraim
to
ride
judah
shall
plow
and
jacob
shall
break
his
clods
sow
to
yourselves
in
righteousness
reap
in
mercy
break
up
your
fallow
ground
for
it
is
time
to
seek
the
lord
till
he
come
and
rain
righteousness
upon
you
ye
have
plowed
wickedness
ye
have
reaped
iniquity
ye
have
eaten
the
fruit
of
lies
because
thou
didst
trust
in
thy
way
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mighty
men
therefore
shall
a
tumult
arise
among
thy
people
and
all
thy
fortresses
shall
be
spoiled
as
shalman
spoiled
betharbel
in
the
day
of
battle
the
mother
was
dashed
in
pieces
upon
her
children
so
shall
bethel
do
unto
you
because
of
your
great
wickedness
in
a
morning
shall
the
king
of
israel
utterly
be
cut
off
when
israel
was
a
child
then
i
loved
him
and
called
my
son
out
of
egypt
as
they
called
them
so
they
went
from
them
they
sacrificed
unto
baalim
and
burned
incense
to
graven
images
i
taught
ephraim
also
to
go
taking
them
by
their
arms
but
they
knew
not
that
i
healed
them
i
drew
them
with
cords
of
a
man
with
bands
of
love
and
i
was
to
them
as
they
that
take
off
the
yoke
on
their
jaws
and
i
laid
meat
unto
them
he
shall
not
return
into
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
assyrian
shall
be
his
king
because
they
refused
to
return
and
the
sword
shall
abide
on
his
cities
and
shall
consume
his
branches
and
devour
them
because
of
their
own
counsels
and
my
people
are
bent
to
backsliding
from
me
though
they
called
them
to
the
most
high
none
at
all
would
exalt
him
how
shall
i
give
thee
up
ephraim
how
shall
i
deliver
thee
israel
how
shall
i
make
thee
as
admah
how
shall
i
set
thee
as
zeboim
mine
heart
is
turned
within
me
my
repentings
are
kindled
together
i
will
not
execute
the
fierceness
of
mine
anger
i
will
not
return
to
destroy
ephraim
for
i
am
god
and
not
man
the
holy
one
in
the
midst
of
thee
and
i
will
not
enter
into
the
city
they
shall
walk
after
the
lord
he
shall
roar
like
a
lion
when
he
shall
roar
then
the
children
shall
tremble
from
the
west
they
shall
tremble
as
a
bird
out
of
egypt
and
as
a
dove
out
of
the
land
of
assyria
and
i
will
place
them
in
their
houses
saith
the
lord
ephraim
compasseth
me
about
with
lies
and
the
house
of
israel
with
deceit
but
judah
yet
ruleth
with
god
and
is
faithful
with
the
saints
ephraim
feedeth
on
wind
and
followeth
after
the
east
wind
he
daily
increaseth
lies
and
desolation
and
they
do
make
a
covenant
with
the
assyrians
and
oil
is
carried
into
egypt
the
lord
hath
also
a
controversy
with
judah
and
will
punish
jacob
according
to
his
ways
according
to
his
doings
will
he
recompense
him
he
took
his
brother
by
the
heel
in
the
womb
and
by
his
strength
he
had
power
with
god
yea
he
had
power
over
the
angel
and
prevailed
he
wept
and
made
supplication
unto
him
he
found
him
in
bethel
and
there
he
spake
with
us
even
the
lord
god
of
hosts
the
lord
is
his
memorial
therefore
turn
thou
to
thy
god
keep
mercy
and
judgment
and
wait
on
thy
god
continually
he
is
a
merchant
the
balances
of
deceit
are
in
his
hand
he
loveth
to
oppress
and
ephraim
said
yet
i
am
become
rich
i
have
found
me
out
substance
in
all
my
labours
they
shall
find
none
iniquity
in
me
that
were
sin
and
i
that
am
the
lord
thy
god
from
the
land
of
egypt
will
yet
make
thee
to
dwell
in
tabernacles
as
in
the
days
of
the
solemn
feast
i
have
also
spoken
by
the
prophets
and
i
have
multiplied
visions
and
used
similitudes
by
the
ministry
of
the
prophets
is
there
iniquity
in
gilead
surely
they
are
vanity
they
sacrifice
bullocks
in
gilgal
yea
their
altars
are
as
heaps
in
the
furrows
of
the
fields
and
jacob
fled
into
the
country
of
syria
and
israel
served
for
a
wife
and
for
a
wife
he
kept
sheep
and
by
a
prophet
the
lord
brought
israel
out
of
egypt
and
by
a
prophet
was
he
preserved
ephraim
provoked
him
to
anger
most
bitterly
therefore
shall
he
leave
his
blood
upon
him
and
his
reproach
shall
his
lord
return
unto
him
when
ephraim
spake
trembling
he
exalted
himself
in
israel
but
when
he
offended
in
baal
he
died
and
now
they
sin
more
and
more
and
have
made
them
molten
images
of
their
silver
and
idols
according
to
their
own
understanding
all
of
it
the
work
of
the
craftsmen
they
say
of
them
let
the
men
that
sacrifice
kiss
the
calves
therefore
they
shall
be
as
the
morning
cloud
and
as
the
early
dew
that
passeth
away
as
the
chaff
that
is
driven
with
the
whirlwind
out
of
the
floor
and
as
the
smoke
out
of
the
chimney
yet
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
thou
shalt
know
no
god
but
me
for
there
is
no
saviour
beside
me
i
did
know
thee
in
the
wilderness
in
the
land
of
great
drought
according
to
their
pasture
so
were
they
filled
they
were
filled
and
their
heart
was
exalted
therefore
have
they
forgotten
me
therefore
i
will
be
unto
them
as
a
lion
as
a
leopard
by
the
way
will
i
observe
them
i
will
meet
them
as
a
bear
that
is
bereaved
of
her
whelps
and
will
rend
the
caul
of
their
heart
and
there
will
i
devour
them
like
a
lion
the
wild
beast
shall
tear
them
o
israel
thou
hast
destroyed
thyself
but
in
me
is
thine
help
i
will
be
thy
king
where
is
any
other
that
may
save
thee
in
all
thy
cities
and
thy
judges
of
whom
thou
saidst
give
me
a
king
and
princes
i
gave
thee
a
king
in
mine
anger
and
took
him
away
in
my
wrath
the
iniquity
of
ephraim
is
bound
up
his
sin
is
hid
the
sorrows
of
a
travailing
woman
shall
come
upon
him
he
is
an
unwise
son
for
he
should
not
stay
long
in
the
place
of
the
breaking
forth
of
children
i
will
ransom
them
from
the
power
of
the
grave
i
will
redeem
them
from
death
o
death
i
will
be
thy
plagues
o
grave
i
will
be
thy
destruction
repentance
shall
be
hid
from
mine
eyes
though
he
be
fruitful
among
his
brethren
an
east
wind
shall
come
the
wind
of
the
lord
shall
come
up
from
the
wilderness
and
his
spring
shall
become
dry
and
his
fountain
shall
be
dried
up
he
shall
spoil
the
treasure
of
all
pleasant
vessels
samaria
shall
become
desolate
for
she
hath
rebelled
against
her
god
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
their
infants
shall
be
dashed
in
pieces
and
their
women
with
child
shall
be
ripped
up
o
israel
return
unto
the
lord
thy
god
for
thou
hast
fallen
by
thine
iniquity
take
with
you

to

forth
his
roots
as

on
the

shall
they
leap
like
the
noise
of
a
flame
of
fire
that
devoureth
the
stubble
as
a
strong
people
set
in
battle
array
before
their
face
the
people
shall
be
much
pained
all
faces
shall
gather
blackness
they
shall
run
like
mighty
men
they
shall
climb
the

like
men
of

ways
and
they
shall
not
break
their

neither
shall

thrust
another
they

every

and
when
they
fall
upon

they

not
be
wounded
they
shall
run
to

in
the
city
they
shall
run
upon
the
wall
they
shall
climb
up
upon
the
houses
they
shall
enter
in
at
the

like
a
thief
the
earth

quake
before
them
the

shall
tremble
the
sun

dark
and
the
stars
shall
withdraw
their

and
the

shall
utter
his
voice
before
his

for
his
camp
is
very
great
for
he
is
strong
that
executeth
his
word
for
the

with
all
your

unto
the

your
god
for
he
is
gracious
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
repenteth
him
of
the
evil
who
knoweth
if
he
will
return
and

let
the

them
say
spare
thy
people
o
lord
and
give
not
thine
heritage
to
reproach
that
the
heathen
should
rule
over
them
wherefore
should
they
say
among
the
people
where

their
god
then
will
the
lord
be
jealous
for
his
land
and
pity
his
people
yea
the

will
answer
and
say
unto
his

and
ye
shall
be
satisfied
therewith
and
i

you
a

into
a
land
barren

desolate
with

his
hinder
part
toward
the

me
a
recompence
and
if
ye
recompense
me
swiftly
and
speedily
will
i
return
your
recompence
upon

carried
into

my
goodly
pleasant
things
the
children
also

them
out
of
the
place
whither
ye
have
sold
them
and

return
your
recompence
upon
your

head
and
i
will
sell
your
sons
and
your
daughters
into
the
hand
of
the
children
of
judah
and
they
shall
sell
them
to
the

egypt
shall
be
a
desolation
and
edom
shall
be
a
desolate
wilderness
for
the
violence
against
the
children

land
but
judah
shall
dwell
for
ever
and
jerusalem
from
generation
to
generation
for
i

that
i

in

amos
the
words
of
amos
who
was
among
the
herdmen
of
tekoa
which
he
saw
concerning
israel
in
the
days
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
and
in
the
days
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of
israel
two
years
before

and
he
said
the

utter
his
voice
from
jerusalem
and
the
habitations
of
the
shepherds
shall
mourn
and
the

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
damascus
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
have

i
will
send
a
fire
into
the
house
of
hazael

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
gaza
and
for

i
will
not

thereof
because
they
carried

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
tyrus
and
for
four
i
will
not

thereof
because
they

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
edom
and
for
four
i
will
not

away
the
punishment
thereof
because
he
did
pursue
his
brother
with
the
sword
and
did
cast
off
all
pity
and
his
anger
did
tear
perpetually
and

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
have
ripped
up
the
women
with
child
of
gilead
that
they
might
enlarge
their
border
but
i
will
kindle
a

in
the
day
of

whirlwind
and
their
king

thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
moab
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
he
burned
the
bones
of
the
king
of
edom
into
lime
but
i
will
send
a
fire
upon
moab
and
it

kirioth
and
moab

die
with
tumult
with

with
the
sound
of

i
will
cut
off
the
judge
from
the
midst
thereof
and
will
slay
all
the
princes
thereof
with
him
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
judah
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
have
despised
the
law
of
the
lord
and
have
not
kept
his
commandments
and
their
lies
caused
them
to
err
after
the
which
their
fathers
have
walked
but
i
will
send
a
fire
upon
judah
and
it
shall
devour
the
palaces
of
jerusalem
thus
saith
the
lord
for
three
transgressions
of
israel
and
for
four
i
will
not
turn
away
the
punishment
thereof
because
they
sold
the
righteous
for
silver
and
the
poor
for
a
pair
of
shoes
that
pant
after
the
dust
of
the
earth
on
the
head
of
the
poor
and
turn
aside
the
way
of
the
meek
and
a
man
and
his
father
will
go
in
unto
the
same
maid
to
profane
my
holy
name
and
they
lay
themselves
down
upon
clothes
laid
to
pledge
by
every
altar
and
they
drink
the
wine
of
the
condemned
in
the
house
of
their
god
yet
destroyed
i
the
amorite
before
them
whose
height
was
like
the
height
of
the
cedars
and
he
was
strong
as
the
oaks
yet
i
destroyed
his
fruit
from
above
and
his
roots
from
beneath
also
i
brought
you
up
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
led
you
forty
years
through
the
wilderness
to
possess
the
land
of
the
amorite
and
i
raised
up
of
your
sons
for
prophets
and
of
your
young
men
for
nazarites
is
it
not
even
thus
o
ye
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
but
ye
gave
the
nazarites
wine
to
drink
and
commanded
the
prophets
saying
prophesy
not
behold
i
am
pressed
under
you
as
a
cart
is
pressed
that
is
full
of
sheaves
therefore
the
flight
shall
perish
from
the
swift
and
the
strong
shall
not
strengthen
his
force
neither
shall
the
mighty
deliver
himself
neither
shall
he
stand
that
handleth
the
bow
and
he
that
is
swift
of
foot
shall
not
deliver
himself
neither
shall
he
that
rideth
the
horse
deliver
himself
and
he
that
is
courageous
among
the
mighty
shall
flee
away
naked
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
hear
this
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
against
you
o
children
of
israel
against
the
whole
family
which
i
brought
up
from
the
land
of
egypt
saying
you
only
have
i
known
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
therefore
i
will
punish
you
for
all
your
iniquities
can
two
walk
together
except
they
be
agreed
will
a
lion
roar
in
the
forest
when
he
hath
no
prey
will
a
young
lion
cry
out
of
his
den
if
he
have
taken
nothing
can
a
bird
fall
in
a
snare
upon
the
earth
where
no
gin
is
for
him
shall
one
take
up
a
snare
from
the
earth
and
have
taken
nothing
at
all
shall
a
trumpet
be
blown
in
the
city
and
the
people
not
be
afraid
shall
there
be
evil
in
a
city
and
the
lord
hath
not
done
it
surely
the
lord
god
will
do
nothing
but
he
revealeth
his
secret
unto
his
servants
the
prophets
the
lion
hath
roared
who
will
not
fear
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
who
can
but
prophesy
publish
in
the
palaces
at
ashdod
and
in
the
palaces
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
say
assemble
yourselves
upon
the
mountains
of
samaria
and
behold
the
great
tumults
in
the
midst
thereof
and
the
oppressed
in
the
midst
thereof
for
they
know
not
to
do
right
saith
the
lord
who
store
up
violence
and
robbery
in
their
palaces
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
an
adversary
there
shall
be
even
round
about
the
land
and
he
shall
bring
down
thy
strength
from
thee
and
thy
palaces
shall
be
spoiled
thus
saith
the
lord
as
the
shepherd
taketh
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lion
two
legs
or
a
piece
of
an
ear
so
shall
the
children
of
israel
be
taken
out
that
dwell
in
samaria
in
the
corner
of
a
bed
and
in
damascus
in
a
couch
hear
ye
and
testify
in
the
house
of
jacob
saith
the
lord
god
the
god
of
hosts
that
in
the
day
that
i
shall
visit
the
transgressions
of
israel
upon
him
i
will
also
visit
the
altars
of
bethel
and
the
horns
of
the
altar
shall
be
cut
off
and
fall
to
the
ground
and
i
will
smite
the
winter
house
with
the
summer
house
and
the
houses
of
ivory
shall
perish
and
the
great
houses
shall

the
lord
hear
this
word
ye
kine
of
bashan
that
are
in
the
mountain
of
samaria
which
oppress
the
poor
which
crush
the
needy
which
say
to
their
masters
bring
and
let
us
drink
the
lord
god
hath
sworn
by
his
holiness
that
lo
the
days
shall
come
upon
you
that
he
will
take
you
away
with
hooks
and
your
posterity
with
fishhooks
and
ye
shall
go
out
at
the
breaches
every
cow
at
that
which
is
before
her
and
ye
shall
cast
them
into
the
palace
saith
the
lord
come
to
bethel
and
transgress
at
gilgal
multiply
transgression
and
bring
your
sacrifices
every
morning
and
your
tithes
after
three
years
and
offer
a
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
with
leaven
and
proclaim
and
publish
the
free
offerings
for
this
liketh
you
o
ye
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
god
and
i
also
have
given
you
cleanness
of
teeth
in
all
your
cities
and
want
of
bread
in
all
your
places
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
and
also
i
have
withholden
the
rain
from
you
when
there
were
yet
three
months
to
the
harvest
and
i
caused
it
to
rain
upon
one
city
and
caused
it
not
to
rain
upon
another
city
one
piece
was
rained
upon
and
the
piece
whereupon
it
rained
not
withered
so
two
or
three
cities
wandered
unto
one
city
to
drink
water
but
they
were
not
satisfied
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
have
smitten
you
with
blasting
and
mildew
when
your
gardens
and
your
vineyards
and
your
fig
trees
and
your
olive
trees
increased
the
palmerworm
devoured
them
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
have
sent
among
you
the
pestilence
after
the
manner
of
egypt
your
young
men
have
i
slain
with
the
sword
and
have
taken
away
your
horses
and
i
have
made
the
stink
of
your
camps
to
come
up
unto
your
nostrils
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
have
overthrown
some
of
you
as
god
overthrew
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
ye
were
as
a
firebrand
plucked
out
of
the
burning
yet
have
ye
not
returned
unto
me
saith
the
lord
therefore
thus
will
i
do
unto
thee
o
israel
and
because
i
will
do
this
unto
thee
prepare
to
meet
thy
god
o
israel
for
lo
he
that
formeth
the
mountains
and
createth
the
wind
and
declareth
unto
man
what
is
his
thought
that
maketh
the
morning
darkness
and
treadeth
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
is
his
name
hear
ye
this
word
which
i
take
up
against
you
even
a
lamentation
o
house
of
israel
the
virgin
of
israel
is
fallen
she
shall
no
more
rise
she
is
forsaken
upon
her
land
there
is
none
to
raise
her
up
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
city
that
went
out
by
a
thousand
shall
leave
an
hundred
and
that
which
went
forth
by
an
hundred
shall
leave
ten
to
the
house
of
israel
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
israel
seek
ye
me
and
ye
shall
live
but
seek
not
bethel
nor
enter
into
gilgal
and
pass
not
to
beersheba
for
gilgal
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
and
bethel
shall
come
to
nought
seek
the
lord
and
ye
shall
live
lest
he
break
out
like
fire
in
the
house
of
joseph
and
devour
it
and
there
be
none
to
quench
it
in
bethel
ye
who
turn
judgment
to
wormwood
and
leave
off
righteousness
in
the
earth
seek
him
that
maketh
the
seven
stars
and
orion
and
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night
that
calleth
for
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
poureth
them
out
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
the
lord
is
his
name
that
strengtheneth
the
spoiled
against
the
strong
so
that
the
spoiled
shall
come
against
the
fortress
they
hate
him
that
rebuketh
in
the
gate
and
they
abhor
him
that
speaketh
uprightly
forasmuch
therefore
as
your
treading
is
upon
the
poor
and
ye
take
from
him
burdens
of
wheat
ye
have
built
houses
of
hewn
stone
but
ye
shall
not
dwell
in
them
ye
have
planted
pleasant
vineyards
but
ye
shall
not
drink
wine
of
them
for
i
know
your
manifold
transgressions
and
your
mighty
sins
they
afflict
the
just
they
take
a
bribe
and
they
turn
aside
the
poor
in
the
gate
from
their
right
therefore
the
prudent
shall
keep
silence
in
that
time
for
it
is
an
evil
time
seek
good
and
not
evil
that
ye
may
live
and
so
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
shall
be
with
you
as
ye
have
spoken
hate
the
evil
and
love
the
good
and
establish
judgment
in
the
gate
it
may
be
that
the
lord
god
of
hosts
will
be
gracious
unto
the
remnant
of
joseph
therefore
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
the
lord
saith
thus
wailing
shall
be
in
all
streets
and
they
shall
say
in
all
the
highways
alas
alas
and
they
shall
call
the
husbandman
to
mourning
and
such
as
are
skilful
of
lamentation
to
wailing
and
in
all
vineyards
shall
be
wailing
for
i
will
pass
through
thee
saith
the
lord
woe
unto
you
that
desire
the
day
of
the
lord
to
what
end
is
it
for
you
the
day
of
the
lord
is
darkness
and
not
light
as
if
a
man
did
flee
from
a
lion
and
a
bear
met
him
or
went
into
the
house
and
leaned
his
hand
on
the
wall
and
a
serpent
bit
him
shall
not
the
day
of
the
lord
be
darkness
and
not
light
even
very
dark
and
no
brightness
in
it
i
hate
i
despise
your
feast
days
and
i
will
not
smell
in
your
solemn
assemblies
though
ye
offer
me
burnt
offerings
and
your
meat
offerings
i
will
not
accept
them
neither
will
i
regard
the
peace
offerings
of
your
fat
beasts
take
thou
away
from
me
the
noise
of
thy
songs
for
i
will
not
hear
the
melody
of
thy
viols
but
let
judgment
run
down
as
waters
and
righteousness
as
a
mighty
stream
have
ye
offered
unto
me
sacrifices
and
offerings
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
o
house
of
israel
but
ye
have
borne
the
tabernacle
of
your
moloch
and
chiun
your
images
the
star
of
your
god
which
ye
made
to
yourselves
therefore
will
i
cause
you
to
go
into
captivity
beyond
damascus
saith
the
lord
whose
name
is
the
god
of
hosts
woe
to
them
that
are
at
ease
in
zion
and
trust
in
the
mountain
of
samaria
which
are
named
chief
of
the
nations
to
whom
the
house
of
israel
came
pass
ye
unto
calneh
and
see
and
from
thence
go
ye
to
hamath
the
great
then
go
down
to
gath
of
the
philistines
be
they
better
than
these
kingdoms
or
their
border
greater
than
your
border
ye
that
put
far
away
the
evil
day
and
cause
the
seat
of
violence
to
come
near
that
lie
upon
beds
of
ivory
and
stretch
themselves
upon
their
couches
and
eat
the
lambs
out
of
the
flock
and
the
calves
out
of
the
midst
of
the
stall
that
chant
to
the
sound
of
the
viol
and
invent
to
themselves
instruments
of
musick
like
david
that
drink
wine
in
bowls
and
anoint
themselves
with
the
chief
ointments
but
they
are
not
grieved
for
the
affliction
of
joseph
therefore
now
shall
they
go
captive
with
the
first
that
go
captive
and
the
banquet
of
them
that
stretched
themselves
shall
be
removed
the
lord
god
hath
sworn
by
himself
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
i
abhor
the
excellency
of
jacob
and
hate
his
palaces
therefore
will
i
deliver
up
the
city
with
all
that
is
therein
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
there
remain
ten
men
in
one
house
that
they
shall
die
and
a
man's
uncle
shall
take
him
up
and
he
that
burneth
him
to
bring
out
the
bones
out
of
the
house
and
shall
say
unto
him
that
is
by
the
sides
of
the
house
is
there
yet
any
with
thee
and
he
shall
say
no
then
shall
he
say
hold
thy
tongue
for
we
may
not
make
mention
of
the
name
of
the
lord
for
behold
the
lord
commandeth
and
he
will
smite
the
great
house
with
breaches
and
the
little
house
with
clefts
shall
horses
run
upon
the
rock
will
one
plow
there
with
oxen
for
ye
have
turned
judgment
into
gall
and
the
fruit
of
righteousness
into
hemlock
ye
which
rejoice
in
a
thing
of
nought
which
say
have
we
not
taken
to
us
horns
by
our
own
strength
but
behold
i
will
raise
up
against
you
a
nation
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
hosts
and
they
shall
afflict
you
from
the
entering
in
of
hemath
unto
the
river
of
the
wilderness
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
he
formed
grasshoppers
in
the
beginning
of
the
shooting
up
of
the
latter
growth
and
lo
it
was
the
latter
growth
after
the
king's
mowings
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating
the
grass
of
the
land
then
i
said
o
lord
god
forgive
i
beseech
thee
by
whom
shall
jacob
arise
for
he
is
small
the
lord
repented
for
this
it
shall
not
be
saith
the
lord
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
the
lord
god
called
to
contend
by
fire
and
it
devoured
the
great
deep
and
did
eat
up
a
part
then
said
i
o
lord
god
cease
i
beseech
thee
by
whom
shall
jacob
arise
for
he
is
small
the
lord
repented
for
this
this
also
shall
not
be
saith
the
lord
god
thus
he
shewed
me
and
behold
the
lord
stood
upon
a
wall
made
by
a
plumbline
with
a
plumbline
in
his
hand
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
amos
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
a
plumbline
then
said
the
lord
behold
i
will
set
a
plumbline
in
the
midst
of
my
people
israel
i
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more
and
the
high
places
of
isaac
shall
be
desolate
and
the
sanctuaries
of
israel
shall
be
laid
waste
and
i
will
rise
against
the
house
of
jeroboam
with
the
sword
then
amaziah
the
priest
of
bethel
sent
to
jeroboam
king
of
israel
saying
amos
hath
conspired
against
thee
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
israel
the
land
is
not
able
to
bear
all
his
words
for
thus
amos
saith
jeroboam
shall
die
by
the
sword
and
israel
shall
surely
be
led
away
captive
out
of
their
own
land
also
amaziah
said
unto
amos
o
thou
seer
go
flee
thee
away
into
the
land
of
judah
and
there
eat
bread
and
prophesy
there
but
prophesy
not
again
any
more
at
bethel
for
it
is
the
king's
chapel
and
it
is
the
king's
court
then
answered
amos
and
said
to
amaziah
i
was
no
prophet
neither
was
i
a
prophet's
son
but
i
was
an
herdman
and
a
gatherer
of
sycomore
fruit
and
the
lord
took
me
as
i
followed
the
flock
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
prophesy
unto
my
people
israel
now
therefore
hear
thou
the
word
of
the
lord
thou
sayest
prophesy
not
against
israel
and
drop
not
thy
word
against
the
house
of
isaac
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
wife
shall
be
an
harlot
in
the
city
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
land
shall
be
divided
by
line
and
thou
shalt
die
in
a
polluted
land
and
israel
shall
surely
go
into
captivity
forth
of
his
land
thus
hath
the
lord
god
shewed
unto
me
and
behold
a
basket
of
summer
fruit
and
he
said
amos
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
a
basket
of
summer
fruit
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
the
end
is
come
upon
my
people
of
israel
i
will
not
again
pass
by
them
any
more
and
the
songs
of
the
temple
shall
be
howlings
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
god
there
shall
be
many
dead
bodies
in
every
place
they
shall
cast
them
forth
with
silence
hear
this
o
ye
that
swallow
up
the
needy
even
to
make
the
poor
of
the
land
to
fail
saying
when
will
the
new
moon
be
gone
that
we
may
sell
corn
and
the
sabbath
that
we
may
set
forth
wheat
making
the
ephah
small
and
the
shekel
great
and
falsifying
the
balances
by
deceit
that
we
may
buy
the
poor
for
silver
and
the
needy
for
a
pair
of
shoes
yea
and
sell
the
refuse
of
the
wheat
the
lord
hath
sworn
by
the
excellency
of
jacob
surely
i
will
never
forget
any
of
their
works
shall
not
the
land
tremble
for
this
and
every
one
mourn
that
dwelleth
therein
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
as
a
flood
and
it
shall
be
cast
out
and
drowned
as
by
the
flood
of
egypt
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
god
that
i
will
cause
the
sun
to
go
down
at
noon
and
i
will
darken
the
earth
in
the
clear
day
and
i
will
turn
your
feasts
into
mourning
and
all
your
songs
into
lamentation
and
i
will
bring
up
sackcloth
upon
all
loins
and
baldness
upon
every
head
and
i
will
make
it
as
the
mourning
of
an
only
son
and
the
end
thereof
as
a
bitter
day
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
god
that
i
will
send
a
famine
in
the
land
not
a
famine
of
bread
nor
a
thirst
for
water
but
of
hearing
the
words
of
the
lord
and
they
shall
wander
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
north
even
to
the
east
they
shall
run
to
and
fro
to
seek
the
word
of
the
lord
and
shall
not
find
it
in
that
day
shall
the
fair
virgins
and
young
men
faint
for
thirst
they
that
swear
by
the
sin
of
samaria
and
say
thy
god
o
dan
liveth
and
the
manner
of
beersheba
liveth
even
they
shall
fall
and
never
rise
up
again
i
saw
the
lord
standing
upon
the
altar
and
he
said
smite
the
lintel
of
the
door
that
the
posts
may
shake
and
cut
them
in
the
head
all
of
them
and
i
will
slay
the
last
of
them
with
the
sword
he
that
fleeth
of
them
shall
not
flee
away
and
he
that
escapeth
of
them
shall
not
be
delivered
though
they
dig
into
hell
thence
shall
mine
hand
take
them
though
they
climb
up
to
heaven
thence
will
i
bring
them
down
and
though
they
hide
themselves
in
the
top
of
carmel
i
will
search
and
take
them
out
thence
and
though
they
be
hid
from
my
sight
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
thence
will
i
command
the
serpent
and
he
shall
bite
them
and
though
they
go
into
captivity
before
their
enemies
thence
will
i
command
the
sword
and
it
shall
slay
them
and
i
will
set
mine
eyes
upon
them
for
evil
and
not
for
good
and
the
lord
god
of
hosts
is
he
that
toucheth
the
land
and
it
shall
melt
and
all
that
dwell
therein
shall
mourn
and
it
shall
rise
up
wholly
like
a
flood
and
shall
be
drowned
as
by
the
flood
of
egypt
it
is
he
that
buildeth
his
stories
in
the
heaven
and
hath
founded
his
troop
in
the
earth
he
that
calleth
for
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
poureth
them
out
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
the
lord

his
name
are
ye
not
as
children
of
the
ethiopians
unto
me
o
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
have
not
i
brought
up
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
philistines
from
caphtor
and
the
syrians
from
kir
behold
the
eyes
of
the
lord
god

given
them
saith
the
lord
thy
god
obadiah
the
vision
of
obadiah
thus
saith
the
lord
god
concerning
edom
we
have
heard
a
rumour
from
the
lord
and
an
ambassador
is
sent
among
the
heathen
arise
ye
and
let
us
rise
up
against
her
in
battle
behold
i
have
made
thee
small
among
the
heathen
thou
art
greatly
despised
the
pride
of
thine
heart
hath
deceived
thee
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
whose
habitation
is
high
that
saith
in
his
heart
who
shall
bring
me
down
to
the
ground
though
thou
exalt
thyself
as
the
eagle
and
though
thou
set
thy
nest
among
the
stars
thence
will
i
bring
thee
down
saith
the
lord
if
thieves
came
to
thee
if
robbers
by
night
how
art
thou
cut
off
would
they
not
have
stolen
till
they
had
enough
if
the
grapegatherers
came
to
thee
would
they
not
leave
some
grapes
how
are
the
things
of
esau
searched
out
how
are
his
hidden
things
sought
up
all
the
men
of
thy
confederacy
have
brought
thee
even
to
the
border
the
men
that
were
at
peace
with
thee
have
deceived
thee
and
prevailed
against
thee
that
they
eat
thy
bread
have
laid
a

under
thee
there

out
of
the
mount
of
esau
and
thy
mighty
men
o
teman
shall
be
dismayed
to
the
end
that
every
one
of
the
mount
of
esau
may
be
cut
off
by
slaughter
for
thy
violence
against
thy
brother
jacob
shame
shall
cover
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
for
ever
in
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
on
the
other
side
in
the
day
that
the
strangers
carried
away
captive
his
forces
and
foreigners
entered
into
his
gates
and
cast
lots
upon
jerusalem
even
thou
wast
as
one
of
them
but
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
the
day
of
thy
brother
in
the
day
that
he
became
a
stranger
neither
shouldest
thou
have
rejoiced
over
the
children
of
judah
in
the
day
of
their
destruction
neither
shouldest
thou
have
spoken
proudly
in
the
day
of
distress
thou
shouldest
not
have
entered
into
the
gate
of
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
yea
thou
shouldest
not
have
looked
on
their
affliction
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
nor
have
laid
hands
on
their
substance
in
the
day
of
their
calamity
neither
shouldest
thou
have
stood
in
the
crossway
to
cut
off
those
of
his
that
did
escape
neither
shouldest
thou
have
delivered
up
those
of
his
that
did
remain
in
the
day
of
distress
for
the
day
of
the
lord
is
near
upon
all
the
heathen
as
thou
hast
done
it
shall
be
done
unto
thee
thy
reward
shall
return
upon
thine
own
head
for
as
ye
have
drunk
upon
my
holy
mountain
so
shall
all
the
heathen
drink
continually
yea
they
shall
drink
and
they
shall
swallow
down
and
they
shall
be
as
though
they
had
not
been
but
upon
mount
zion
shall
be
deliverance
and
there
shall
be
holiness
and
the
house
of
jacob
shall
possess
their
possessions
and
the
house
of
jacob
shall
be
a
fire
and
the
house
of
joseph
a
flame
and
the
house
of
esau
for
stubble
and
they
shall
kindle
in
them
and
devour
them
and
there
shall
not
be
any
remaining
of
the
house
of
esau
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
and
they
of
the
south
shall
possess
the
mount
of
esau
and
they
of
the
plain
the
philistines
and
they
shall
possess
the
fields
of
ephraim
and
the
fields
of
samaria
and
benjamin
shall
possess
gilead
and
the
captivity
of
this
host
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
possess
that
of
the
canaanites
even
unto
zarephath
and
the
captivity
of
jerusalem
which
is
in
sepharad
shall
possess
the
cities
of
the
south
and
saviours
shall
come
up
on
mount
zion
to
judge
the
mount
of
esau
and
the
kingdom
shall
be
the
lord's
jonah
now
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jonah
the
son
of
amittai
saying
arise
go
to
nineveh
that
great
city
and
cry
against
it
for
their
wickedness
is
come
up
before
me
but
jonah
rose
up
to
flee
unto
tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
went
down
to
joppa
and
he
found
a
ship
going
to
tarshish
so
he
paid
the
fare
thereof
and
went
down
into
it
to
go
with
them
unto
tarshish
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
but
the
lord
sent
out
a
great
wind
into
the
sea
and
there
was
a
mighty
tempest
in
the
sea
so
that
the
ship
was
like
to
be
broken
then
the
mariners
were
afraid
and
cried
every
man
unto
his
god
and
cast
forth
the
wares
that
were
in
the
ship
into
the
sea
to
lighten
it
of
them
but
jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
sides
of
the
ship
and
he
lay
and
was
fast
asleep
so
the
shipmaster
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
what
meanest
thou
o
sleeper
arise
call
upon
thy
god
if
so
be
that
god
will
think
upon
us
that
we
perish
not
and
they
said
every
one
to
his
fellow
come
and
let
us
cast
lots
that
we
may
know
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us
so
they
cast
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
jonah
then
said
they
unto
him
tell
us
we
pray
thee
for
whose
cause
this
evil
is
upon
us
what
is
thine
occupation
and
whence
comest
thou
what
is
thy
country
and
of
what
people
art
thou
and
he
said
unto
them
i
am
an
hebrew
and
i
fear
the
lord
the
god
of
heaven
which
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
then
were
the
men
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
done
this
for
the
men
knew
that
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
because
he
had
told
them
then
said
they
unto
him
what
shall
we
do
unto
thee
that
the
sea
may
be
calm
unto
us
for
the
sea
wrought
and
was
tempestuous
and
he
said
unto
them
take
me
up
and
cast
me
forth
into
the
sea
so
shall
the
sea
be
calm
unto
you
for
i
know
that
for
my
sake
this
great
tempest
is
upon
you
nevertheless
the
men
rowed
hard
to
bring
it
to
the
land
but
they
could
not
for
the
sea
wrought
and
was
tempestuous
against
them
wherefore
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
we
beseech
thee
o
lord
we
beseech
thee
let
us
not
perish
for
this
man's
life
and
lay
not
upon
us
innocent
blood
for
thou
o
lord
hast
done
as
it
pleased
thee
so
they
look
up
jonah
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
ceased
from
her
raging
then
the
men
feared
the
lord
exceedingly
and
offered
a
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
and
made
vows
now
the
lord
had
prepared
a
great
fish
to
swallow
up
jonah
and
jonah
was
in
the
belly
of
the
fish
three
days
and
three
nights
then
jonah
prayed
unto
the
lord
his
god
out
of
the
fish's
belly
and
said
i
cried
by
reason
of
mine
affliction
unto
the
lord
and
he
heard
me
out
of
the
belly
of
hell
cried
i
and
thou
heardest
my
voice
for
thou
hadst
cast
me
into
the
deep
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
and
the
floods
compassed
me
about
all
thy
billows
and
thy
waves
passed
over
me
then
i
said
i
am
cast
out
of
thy
sight
yet
i
will
look
again
toward
thy
holy
temple
the
waters
compassed
me
about
even
to
the
soul
the
depth
closed
me
round
about
the
weeds
were
wrapped
about
my
head
i
went
down
to
the
bottoms
of
the
mountains
the
earth
with
her
bars
was
about
me
for
ever
yet
hast
thou
brought
up
my
life
from
corruption
o
lord
my
god
when
my
soul
fainted
within
me
i
remembered
the
lord
and
my
prayer
came
in
unto
thee
into
thine
holy
temple
they
that
observe
lying
vanities
forsake
their
own
mercy
but
i
will
sacrifice
unto
thee
with
the
voice
of
thanksgiving
i
will
pay
that
that
i
have
vowed
salvation
is
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
spake
unto
the
fish
and
it
vomited
out
jonah
upon
the
dry
land
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
jonah
the
second
time
saying
arise
go
unto
nineveh
that
great
city
and
preach
unto
it
the
preaching
that
i
bid
thee
so
jonah
arose
and
went
unto
nineveh
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
now
nineveh
was
an
exceeding
great
city
of
three
days
journey
and
jonah
began
to
enter
into
the
city
a
day's
journey
and
he
cried
and
said
yet
forty
days
and
nineveh
shall
be
overthrown
so
the
people
of
nineveh
believed
god
and
proclaimed
a
fast
and
put
on
sackcloth
from
the
greatest
of
them
even
to
the
least
of
them
for
word
came
unto
the
king
of
nineveh
and
he
arose
from
his
throne
and
he
laid
his
robe
from
him
and
covered
him
with
sackcloth
and
sat
in
ashes
and
he
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
and
published
through
nineveh
by
the
decree
of
the
king
and
his
nobles
saying
let
neither
man
nor
beast
herd
nor
flock
taste
any
thing
let
them
not
feed
nor
drink
water
but
let
man
and
beast
be
covered
with
sackcloth
and
cry
mightily
unto
god
yea
let
them
turn
every
one
from
his
evil
way
and
from
the
violence
that
is
in
their
hands
who
can
tell
if
god
will
turn
and
repent
and
turn
away
from
his
fierce
anger
that
we
perish
not
and
god
saw
their
works
that
they
turned
from
their
evil
way
and
god
repented
of
the
evil
that
he
had
said
that
he
would
do
unto
them
and
he
did
it
not
but
it
displeased
jonah
exceedingly
and
he
was
very
angry
and
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
said
i
pray
thee
o
lord
was
not
this
my
saying
when
i
was
yet
in
my
country
therefore
i
fled
before
unto
tarshish
for
i
knew
that
thou
art
a
gracious
god
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
repentest
thee
of
the
evil
therefore
now
o
lord
take
i
beseech
thee
my
life
from
me
for
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
then
said
the
lord
doest
thou
well
to
be
angry
so
jonah
went
out
of
the
city
and
sat
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
and
there
made
him
a
booth
and
sat
under
it
in
the
shadow
till
he
might
see
what
would
become
of
the
city
and
the
lord
god
prepared
a
gourd
and
made
it
to
come
up
over
jonah
that
it
might
be
a
shadow
over
his
head
to
deliver
him
from
his
grief
so
jonah
was
exceeding
glad
of
the
gourd
but
god
prepared
a
worm
when
the
morning
rose
the
next
day
and
it
smote
the
gourd
that
it
withered
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
sun
did
arise
that
god
prepared
a
vehement
east
wind
and
the
sun
beat
upon
the
head
of
jonah
that
he
fainted
and
wished
in
himself
to
die
and
said
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
and
god
said
to
jonah
doest
thou
well
to
be
angry
for
the
gourd
and
he
said
i
do
well
to
be
angry
even
unto
death
then
said
the
lord
thou
hast
had
pity
on
the
gourd
for
the
which
thou
hast
not
laboured
neither
madest
it
grow
which
came
up
in
a
night
and
perished
in
a
night
and
should
not
i
spare
nineveh
that
great
city
wherein
are
more
then
sixscore
thousand
persons
that
cannot
discern
between
their
right
hand
and
their
left
hand
and
also
much
cattle
micah
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
micah
the
morasthite
in
the
days
of
jotham
ahaz
and
hezekiah
kings
of
judah
which
he
saw
concerning
samaria
and
jerusalem
hear
all
ye
people
hearken
o
earth
and
all
that
therein
is
and
let
the
lord
god
be
witness
against
you
the
lord
from
his
holy
temple
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
forth
out
of
his
place
and
will
come
down
and
tread
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
and
the
mountains
shall
be
molten
under
him
and
the
valleys
shall
be
cleft
as
wax
before
the
fire
and
as
the
waters
that
are
poured
down
a
steep
place
for
the
transgression
of
jacob
is
all
this
and
for
the
sins
of
the
house
of
israel
what
is
the
transgression
of
jacob
is
it
not
samaria
and
what
are
the
high
places
of
judah
are
they
not
jerusalem
therefore
i
will
make
samaria
as
an
heap
of
the
field
and
as
plantings
of
a
vineyard
and
i
will
pour
down
the
stones
thereof
into
the
valley
and
i
will
discover
the
foundations
thereof
and
all
the
graven
images
thereof
shall
be
beaten
to
pieces
and
all
the
hires
thereof
shall
be
burned
with
the
fire
and
all
the
idols
thereof
will
i
lay
desolate
for
she
gathered
it
of
the
hire
of
an
harlot
and
they
shall
return
to
the
hire
of
an
harlot
therefore
i
will
wail
and
howl
i
will
go
stripped
and
naked
i
will
make
a
wailing
like
the
dragons
and
mourning
as
the
owls
for
her
wound
is
incurable
for
it
is
come
unto
judah
he
is
come
unto
the
gate
of
my
people
even
to
jerusalem
declare
ye
it
not
at
gath
weep
ye
not
at
all
in
the
house
of
aphrah
roll
thyself
in
the
dust
pass
ye
away
thou
inhabitant
of
saphir
having
thy
shame
naked
the
inhabitant
of
zaanan
came
not
forth
in
the
mourning
of
bethezel
he
shall
receive
of
you
his
standing
for
the
inhabitant
of
maroth
waited
carefully
for
good
but
evil
came
down
from
the
lord
unto
the
gate
of
jerusalem
o
thou
inhabitant
of
lachish
bind
the
chariot
to
the
swift
beast
she
is
the
beginning
of
the
sin
to
the
daughter
of
zion
for
the
transgressions
of

found
in
thee
therefore

thou
give
presents
to
moreshethgath

houses
of
achzib

be
a
lie
to
the
kings
of

unto
adullam
the
glory
of
israel
make
thee
bald
and
poll
thee
for
thy
delicate
children
enlarge
thy
baldness
as
the
eagle
for
they
are
gone
into
captivity
from
thee
woe
to
them
that
devise
iniquity
and
work
evil
upon
their
beds
when
the
morning
is
light
they
practise
it
because
it
is
in
the
power
of
their
hand
and
they
covet
fields
and
take
them
by
violence
and
houses
and
take
them
away
so
they
oppress
a
man
and
his
house
even
a
man
and
his
heritage
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
against
this
family
do
i
devise
an
evil
from
which
ye
shall
not
remove
your
necks
neither
shall
ye
go
haughtily
for
this
time
is
evil
in
that
day
shall
one
take
up
a
parable
against
you
and
lament
with
a
doleful
lamentation
and
say
we
be
utterly
spoiled
he
hath
changed
the
portion
of
my
people
how
hath
he
removed
it
from
me
turning
away
he
hath
divided
our
fields
therefore
thou
shalt
have
none
that
shall
cast
a
cord
by
lot
in
the
congregation
of
the
lord
prophesy
ye
not
say
they
to
them
that
prophesy
they
shall
not
prophesy
to
them
that
they
shall
not
take
shame
o
thou
that
art
named
the
house
of
jacob
is
the
spirit
of
the
lord
straitened
are
these
his
doings
do
not
my
words
do
good
to
him
that
walketh
uprightly
even
of
late
my
people
is
risen
up
as
an
enemy
ye
pull
off
the
robe
with
the
garment
from
them
that
pass
by
securely
as
men
averse
from
war
the
women
of
my
people
have
ye
cast
out
from
their
pleasant
houses
from
their
children
have
ye
taken
away
my
glory
for
ever
arise
ye
and
depart
for
this
is
not
your
rest
because
it
is
polluted
it
shall
destroy
you
even
with
a
sore
destruction
if
a
man
walking
in
the
spirit
and
falsehood
do
lie
saying
i
will
prophesy
unto
thee
of
wine
and
of
strong
drink
he
shall
even
be
the
prophet
of
this
people
i
will
surely
assemble
o
jacob
all
of
thee
i
will
surely
gather
the
remnant
of
israel
i
will
put
them
together
as
the
sheep
of
bozrah
as
the
flock
in
the
midst
of
their
fold
they
shall
make
great
noise
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
men
the
breaker
is
come
up
before
them
they
have
broken
up
and
have
passed
through
the
gate
and
are
gone
out
by
it
and
their
king
shall
pass
before
them
and
the
lord
on
the
head
of
them
and
i
said
hear
i
pray
you
o
heads
of
jacob
and
ye
princes
of
the
house
of
israel
is
it
not
for
you
to
know
judgment
who
hate
the
good
and
love
the
evil
who
pluck
off
their
skin
from
off
them
and
their
flesh
from
off
their
bones
who
also
eat
the
flesh
of
my
people
and
flay
their
skin
from
off
them
and
they
break
their
bones
and
chop
them
in
pieces
as
for
the
pot
and
as
flesh
within
the
caldron
then
shall
they
cry
unto
the
lord
but
he
will
not
hear
them
he
will
even
hide
his
face
from
them
at
that
time
as
they
have
behaved
themselves
ill
in
their
doings
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
prophets
that
make
my
people
err
that
bite
with
their
teeth
and
cry
peace
and
he
that
putteth
not
into
their
mouths
they
even
prepare
war
against
him
therefore
night
shall
be
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
have
a
vision
and
it
shall
be
dark
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
divine
and
the
sun
shall
go
down
over
the
prophets
and
the
day
shall
be
dark
over
them
then
shall
the
seers
be
ashamed
and
the
diviners
confounded
yea
they
shall
all
cover
their
lips
for
there
is
no
answer
of
god
but
truly
i
am
full
of
power
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
of
judgment
and
of
might
to
declare
unto
jacob
his
transgression
and
to
israel
his
sin
hear
this
i
pray
you
ye
heads
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
princes
of
the
house
of
israel
that
abhor
judgment
and
pervert
all
equity
they
build
up
zion
with
blood
and
jerusalem
with
iniquity
the
heads
thereof
judge
for
reward
and
the
priests
thereof
teach
for
hire
and
the
prophets
thereof
divine
for
money
yet
will
they
lean
upon
the
lord
and
say
is
not
the
lord
among
us
none
evil
can
