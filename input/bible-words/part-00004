o

for

come
in
unto

soul
i
sink
in
deep
mire
where
there
is
no
standing
i
am
come
into
deep
waters
where
the
floods
overflow
me
i
am
weary
of
my
crying
my
throat
is
dried
mine
eyes
fail
while
i
wait
for
my
god
they
that
hate
me
without
a
cause
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head
they
that
would
destroy
me
being
mine
enemies
wrongfully
are
mighty
then
i
restored
that
which
i
took
not
away
o
god
thou
knowest
my
foolishness
and
my
sins
are
not
hid
from
thee
let
not
them
that
wait
on
thee
o
lord
god
of
hosts
be
ashamed
for
my
sake
let
not
those
that
seek
thee
be
confounded
for
my
sake
o
god
of
israel
because
for
thy
sake
i
have
borne
reproach
shame
hath
covered
my
face
i
am
become
a
stranger
unto
my
brethren
and
an
alien
unto
my
mother's
children
for
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up
and
the
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
are
fallen
upon
me
when
i
wept
and
chastened
my
soul
with
fasting
that
was
to
my
reproach
i
made
sackcloth
also
my
garment
and
i
became
a
proverb
to
them
they
that
sit
in
the
gate
speak
against
me
and
i
was
the
song
of
the
drunkards
but
as
for
me
my
prayer
is
unto
thee
o
lord
in
an
acceptable
time
o
god
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
hear
me
in
the
truth
of
thy
salvation
deliver
me
out
of
the
mire
and
let
me
not
sink
let
me
be
delivered
from
them
that
hate
me
and
out
of
the
deep
waters
let
not
the
waterflood
overflow
me
neither
let
the
deep
swallow
me
up
and
let
not
the
pit
shut
her
mouth
upon
me
hear
me
o
lord
for
thy
lovingkindness
is
good
turn
unto
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
and
hide
not
thy
face
from
thy
servant
for
i
am
in
trouble
hear
me
speedily
draw
nigh
unto
my
soul
and
redeem
it

me
because
of
mine
enemies
thou
hast
known
my
reproach
and
my
shame
and
my
dishonour
mine
adversaries
are
all
before
thee
reproach
hath
broken
my
heart
and
i
am
full
of
heaviness
and
i
looked
for
some
to
take
pity
but
there
was
none
and
for
comforters
but
i
found
none
they
gave
me
also
gall
for
my
meat
and
in
my
thirst
they
gave
me
vinegar
to
drink
let
their
table
become
a
snare
before
them
and
that
which
should
have
been
for
their
welfare
let
it
become
a
trap
let
their
eyes
be
darkened
that
they
see
not
and
make
their
loins
continually
to
shake
pour
out
thine
indignation
upon
them
and
let
thy
wrathful
anger
take
hold
of
them
let
their
habitation
be
desolate
and
let
none
dwell
in
their
tents
for
they
persecute
him
whom
thou
hast
smitten
and
they
talk
to
the
grief
of
those
whom
thou
hast
wounded
add
iniquity
unto
their
iniquity
and
let
them
not
come
into
thy
righteousness
let
them
be
blotted
out
of
the
book
of
the
living
and
not
be
written
with
the
righteous
but
i
am
poor
and
sorrowful
let
thy
salvation
o
god
set
me
up
on
high
i
will
praise
the
name
of
god
with
a
song
and
will
magnify
him
with
thanksgiving
this
also
shall
please
the
lord
better
than
an
ox
or
bullock
that
hath
horns
and
hoofs
the
humble
shall
see
this
and
be
glad
and
your
heart
shall
live
that
seek
god
for
the
lord
heareth
the
poor
and
despiseth
not
his
prisoners
let
the
heaven
and
earth
praise
him
the
seas
and
every
thing
that
moveth
therein
for
god
will
save
zion
and
will
build
the
cities
of
judah
that
they
may
dwell
there
and
have
it
in
possession
the
seed
also
of
his
servants
shall
inherit
it
and
they
that
love
his
name
shall
dwell
therein
make
haste
o
god
to
deliver
me
make
haste
to
help
me
o
lord
let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
that

after
my
soul
let
them
be
turned
backward
and
put
to
confusion
that
desire
my
hurt
let
them
be
turned
back
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
aha
aha
let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee
and
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually
let
god
be
magnified
but
i
am
poor
and
needy
make
haste
unto
me
o
god

art
my
help
and

against
me
and

for
my
soul

counsel
together
saying

him
for

shall
be
made
for

his
glorious
name
for

and
let
the
whole
earth
be
filled
with
his
glory
amen
and
amen
the
prayers
of
david
the
son
of
jesse
are
ended
truly
god
is
good
to
israel
even
to
such
as
are
of
a
clean
heart
but
as
for
me
my
feet
were
almost
gone
my
steps
had
well
nigh
slipped
for
i
was
envious
at
the
foolish
when
i
saw
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
for
there
are
no
bands
in
their
death
but
their
strength
is
firm
they
are
not
in
trouble
as
other
men
neither
are
they
plagued
like
other
men
therefore
pride
compasseth
them
about
as
a
chain
violence
covereth
them
as
a
garment
their
eyes
stand
out
with
fatness
they
have
more
than
heart
could
wish
they
are
corrupt
and
speak
wickedly
concerning
oppression
they
speak
loftily
they
set
their
mouth
against
the
heavens
and
their
tongue
walketh
through
the
earth
therefore
his
people
return
hither
and
waters
of
a
full
cup
are
wrung
out
to
them
and
they
say
how
doth
god
know
and
is
there
knowledge
in
the
most
high
behold
these
are
the
ungodly
who
prosper
in
the
world
they
increase
in
riches
verily
i
have
cleansed
my
heart
in
vain
and
washed
my
hands
in
innocency
for
all
the
day
long
have
i
been
plagued
and
chastened
every
morning
if
i
say
i
will
speak
thus
behold
i
should
offend
against
the
generation
of
thy
children
when
i
thought
to
know
this
it
was
too
painful
for
me
until
i
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
god
then
understood
i
their
end
surely
thou
didst
set
them
in
slippery
places
thou
castedst
them
down
into
destruction
how
are
they
brought
into
desolation
as
in
a
moment
they
are
utterly
consumed
with
terrors
as
a
dream
when
one
awaketh
so
o
lord
when
thou
awakest
thou
shalt
despise
their
image
thus
my
heart
was
grieved
and
i
was
pricked
in
my
reins
so
foolish
was
i
and
ignorant
i
was
as
a
beast
before
thee
nevertheless
i
am
continually
with
thee
thou
hast
holden
me
by
my
right
hand
thou
shalt
guide
me
with
thy
counsel
and
afterward
receive
me
to
glory
whom
have
i
in
heaven
but
thee
and
there
is
none
upon
earth
that
i
desire
beside
thee
my
flesh
and
my
heart
faileth
but
god
is
the
strength
of
my
heart
and
my
portion
for
ever
for
lo
they
that
are
far
from
thee
shall
perish
thou
hast
destroyed
all
them
that
go
a
whoring
from
thee
but
it
is
good
for
me
to
draw
near
to
god
i
have
put
my
trust
in
the
lord
god
that
i
may
declare
all
thy
works
o
god
why
hast
thou
cast
us
off
for
ever
why
doth
thine
anger
smoke
against
the
sheep
of
thy
pasture
remember
thy
congregation
which
thou
hast
purchased
of
old
the
rod
of
thine
inheritance
which
thou
hast
redeemed
this
mount
zion
wherein
thou
hast
dwelt
lift
up
thy
feet
unto
the
perpetual
desolations
even
all
that
the
enemy
hath
done
wickedly
in
the
sanctuary
thine
enemies
roar
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations
they
set
up
their
ensigns
for
signs
a
man
was
famous
according
as
he
had
lifted
up
axes
upon
the
thick
trees
but
now
they
break
down
the
carved
work
thereof
at
once
with
axes
and
hammers
they
have
cast
fire
into
thy
sanctuary
they
have
defiled
by
casting
down
the
dwelling
place
of
thy
name
to
the
ground
they
said
in
their
hearts
let
us
destroy
them
together
they
have
burned
up
all
the
synagogues
of
god
in
the
land
we
see
not
our
signs
there
is
no
more
any
prophet
neither
is
there
among
us
any
that
knoweth
how
long
o
god
how
long
shall
the
adversary
reproach
shall
the
enemy
blaspheme
thy
name
for
ever
why
withdrawest
thou
thy
hand
even
thy
right
hand
pluck
it
out
of
thy
bosom
for
god
is
my
king
of
old
working
salvation
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
thou
didst
divide
the
sea
by
thy
strength
thou
brakest
the
heads
of
the
dragons
in
the
waters
thou
brakest
the
heads
of
leviathan
in
pieces
and
gavest
him
to
be
meat
to
the
people
inhabiting
the
wilderness
thou
didst
cleave
the
fountain
and
the
flood
thou
driedst
up
mighty
rivers
the
day
is
thine
the
night
also
is
thine
thou
hast
prepared
the
light
and
the
sun
thou
hast
set
all
the
borders
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
summer
and
winter
remember
this
that
the
enemy
hath
reproached
o
lord
and
that
the
foolish
people
have
blasphemed
thy
name
o
deliver
not
the
soul
of
thy
turtledove
unto
the
multitude
of
the
wicked
forget
not
the
congregation
of
thy
poor
for
ever
have
respect
unto
the
covenant
for
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
are
full
of
the
habitations
of
cruelty
o
let
not
the
oppressed
return
ashamed
let
the
poor
and
needy
praise
thy
name
arise
o
god
plead
thine
own
cause
remember
how
the
foolish
man
reproacheth
thee
daily
forget
not
the
voice
of
thine
enemies
the
tumult
of
those
that
rise
up
against
thee
increaseth
continually
unto
thee
o
god
do
we
give
thanks
unto
thee
do
we
give
thanks
for
that
thy
name
is
near
thy
wondrous
works
declare
when
i
shall
receive
the
congregation
i
will
judge
uprightly
the
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
dissolved
i
bear
up
the
pillars
of
it
selah
i
said
unto
the
fools
deal
not
foolishly
and
to
the
wicked
lift
not
up
the
horn

not
up
your
horn

speak
not
with
a
stiff
neck
for
promotion
cometh
neither
from
the
east
nor
from

but
god
is
the
judge
he
putteth
down
one
and
setteth
up
another
for
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
there
is
a
cup
and
the
wine
is
red
it
is
full
of
mixture
and
he
poureth
out
of

same
but
the
dregs
thereof
all
the
wicked
of

i
will
declare
for
ever
i
will
sing
praises
to
the
god
of
jacob

the
horns
of
the
wicked

i
cut
off

righteous
shall
be
exalted
in
judah

god
known
his
name
is
great
in
israel
in
salem
also
is
his
tabernacle
and
his
dwelling
place
in
zion
there
brake
he
the
arrows
of
the
bow
the
shield
and
the
sword
and
the
battle
selah
thou
art
more
glorious
and
excellent
than
the
mountains
of
prey
the
stouthearted
are
spoiled
they
have
slept
their
sleep
and
none
of
the
men
of
might
have
found
their
hands
at
thy
rebuke
o
god
of
jacob
both
the
chariot
and
horse
are
cast
into
a
dead
sleep
thou
even
thou
art
to
be
feared
and
who
may
stand
in
thy
sight
when
once
thou
art
angry
thou
didst
cause
judgment
to
be
heard
from
heaven
the
earth
feared
and
was
still
when
god
arose
to
judgment
to
save
all
the
meek
of
the
earth
selah
surely
the
wrath
of
man
shall
praise
thee
the
remainder
of
wrath
shalt
thou
restrain
vow
and
pay
unto
the
lord
your
god
let
all
that
be
round
about
him
bring
presents
unto
him
that
ought
to
be
feared
he
shall
cut
off
the
spirit
of
princes
he
is
terrible
to
the
kings
of
the
earth
i
cried
unto
god
with
my
voice
even
unto
god
with
my
voice
and
he
gave
ear
unto
me
in
the
day
of
my
trouble
i
sought
the
lord
my
sore
ran
in
the
night
and
ceased
not
my
soul
refused
to
be
comforted
i
remembered
god
and
was
troubled
i
complained
and
my
spirit
was
overwhelmed
selah
thou
holdest
mine
eyes
waking
i
am
so
troubled
that
i
cannot
speak
i
have
considered
the
days
of
old
the
years
of
ancient
times
i
call
to
remembrance
my
song
in
the
night
i
commune
with
mine
own
heart
and
my
spirit
made
diligent
search
will
the
lord
cast
off
for
ever
and
will
he
be
favourable
no
more
is
his
mercy
clean
gone
for
ever
doth
his
promise
fail
for
evermore
hath
god
forgotten
to
be
gracious
hath
he
in
anger
shut
up
his
tender
mercies
selah
and
i
said
this
is
my
infirmity
but
i
will
remember
the
years
of
the
right
hand
of
the
most
high
i
will
remember
the
works
of
the
lord
surely
i
will
remember
thy
wonders
of
old
i
will
meditate
also
of
all
thy
work
and
talk
of
thy
doings
thy
way
o
god
is
in
the
sanctuary
who
is
so
great
a
god
as
our
god
thou
art
the
god
that
doest
wonders
thou
hast
declared
thy
strength
among
the
people
thou
hast
with
thine
arm
redeemed
thy
people
the
sons
of
jacob
and
joseph
selah
the
waters
saw
thee
o
god
the
waters
saw
thee
they
were
afraid
the
depths
also
were
troubled
the
clouds
poured
out
water
the
skies
sent
out
a
sound
thine
arrows
also
went
abroad
the
voice
of
thy
thunder
was
in
the
heaven
the
lightnings
lightened
the
world
the
earth
trembled
and
shook
thy
way
is
in
the
sea
and
thy
path
in
the
great
waters
and
thy
footsteps
are
not
known
thou
leddest
thy
people
like
a
flock
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
aaron
give
ear
o
my
people
to
my
law
incline
your
ears
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
parable
i
will
utter
dark
sayings
of
old
which
we
have
heard
and
known
and
our
fathers
have
told
us
we
will
not
hide
them
from
their
children
shewing
to
the
generation
to
come
the
praises
of
the
lord
and
his
strength
and
his
wonderful
works
that
he
hath
done
for
he
established
a
testimony
in
jacob
and
appointed
a
law
in
israel
which
he
commanded
our
fathers
that
they
should
make
them
known
to
their
children
that
the
generation
to
come
might
know
them
even
the
children
which
should
be
born
who
should
arise
and
declare
them
to
their
children
that
they
might
set
their
hope
in
god
and
not
forget
the
works
of
god
but
keep
his
commandments
and
might
not
be
as
their
fathers
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation
a
generation
that
set
not
their
heart
aright
and
whose
spirit
was
not
stedfast
with
god
the
children
of
ephraim
being
armed
and
carrying
bows
turned
back
in
the
day
of
battle
they
kept
not
the
covenant
of
god
and
refused
to
walk
in
his
law
and
forgat
his
works
and
his
wonders
that
he
had
shewed
them
marvellous
things
did
he
in
the
sight
of
their
fathers
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
field
of
zoan
he
divided
the
sea
and
caused
them
to
pass
through
and
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
as
an
heap
in
the
daytime
also
he
led
them
with
a
cloud
and
all
the
night
with
a
light
of
fire
he
clave
the
rocks
in
the
wilderness
and
gave
them
drink
as
out
of
the
great
depths
he
brought
streams
also
out
of
the
rock
and
caused
waters
to
run
down
like
rivers
and
they
sinned
yet
more
against
him
by
provoking
the
most
high
in
the
wilderness
and
they
tempted
god
in
their
heart
by
asking
meat
for
their
lust
yea
they
spake
against
god
they
said
can
god
furnish
a
table
in
the
wilderness
behold
he
smote
the
rock
that
the
waters
gushed
out
and
the
streams
overflowed
can
he
give
bread
also
can
he
provide
flesh
for
his
people
therefore
the
lord
heard
this
and
was
wroth
so
a
fire
was
kindled
against
jacob
and
anger
also
came
up
against
israel
because
they
believed
not
in
god
and
trusted
not
in
his
salvation
though
he
had
commanded
the
clouds
from
above
and
opened
the
doors
of
heaven
and
had
rained
down
manna
upon
them
to
eat
and
had
given
them
of
the
corn
of
heaven
man
did
eat
angels
food
he
sent
them
meat
to
the
full
he
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
heaven
and
by
his
power
he
brought
in
the
south
wind
he
rained
flesh
also
upon
them
as
dust
and
feathered
fowls
like
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
he
let
it
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
camp
round
about
their
habitations
so
they
did
eat
and
were
well
filled
for
he
gave
them
their
own
desire
they
were
not
estranged
from
their
lust
but
while
their
meat
was
yet
in
their
mouths
the
wrath
of
god
came
upon
them
and
slew
the
fattest
of
them
and
smote
down
the
chosen
men
of
israel
for
all
this
they
sinned
still
and
believed
not
for
his
wondrous
works
therefore
their
days
did
he
consume
in
vanity
and
their
years
in
trouble
when
he
slew
them
then
they
sought
him
and
they
returned
and
enquired
early
after
god
and
they
remembered
that
god
was
their
rock
and
the
high
god
their
redeemer
nevertheless
they
did
flatter
him
with
their
mouth
and
they
lied
unto
him
with
their
tongues
for
their
heart
was
not
right
with
him
neither
were
they
stedfast
in
his
covenant
but
he
being
full
of
compassion
forgave
their
iniquity
and
destroyed
them
not
yea
many
a
time
turned
he
his
anger
away
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
wrath
for
he
remembered
that
they
were
but
flesh
a
wind
that
passeth
away
and
cometh
not
again
how
oft
did
they
provoke
him
in
the
wilderness
and
grieve
him
in
the
desert
yea
they
turned
back
and
tempted
god
and
limited
the
holy
one
of
israel
they
remembered
not
his
hand
nor
the
day
when
he
delivered
them
from
the
enemy
how
he
had
wrought
his
signs
in
egypt
and
his
wonders
in
the
field
of
zoan
and
had
turned
their
rivers
into
blood
and
their
floods
that
they
could
not
drink
he
sent
divers
sorts
of
flies
among
them
which
devoured
them
and
frogs
which
destroyed
them
he
gave
also
their
increase
unto
the
caterpiller
and
their
labour
unto
the
locust
he
destroyed
their
vines
with
hail
and
their
sycomore
trees
with
frost
he
gave
up
their
cattle
also
to
the
hail
and
their
flocks
to
hot
thunderbolts
he
cast
upon
them
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
wrath
and
indignation
and
trouble
by
sending
evil
angels
among
them
he
made
a
way
to
his
anger
he
spared
not
their
soul
from
death
but
gave
their
life
over
to
the
pestilence
and
smote
all
the
firstborn
in
egypt
the
chief
of
their
strength
in
the
tabernacles
of
ham
but
made
his
own
people
to
go
forth
like
sheep
and
guided
them
in
the
wilderness
like
a
flock
and
he
led
them
on
safely
so
that
they
feared
not
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
enemies
and
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
sanctuary
even
to
this
mountain
which
his
right
hand
had
purchased
he
cast
out
the
heathen
also
before
them
and
divided
them
an
inheritance
by
line
and
made
the
tribes
of
israel
to
dwell
in
their
tents
yet
they
tempted
and
provoked
the
most
high
god
and
kept
not
his
testimonies
but
turned
back
and
dealt
unfaithfully
like
their
fathers
they
were
turned
aside
like
a
deceitful
bow
for
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
high
places
and
moved
him
to
jealousy
with
their
graven
images
when
god
heard
this
he
was
wroth
and
greatly
abhorred
israel
so
that
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
shiloh
the
tent
which
he
placed
among
men
and
delivered
his
strength
into
captivity
and
his
glory
into
the
enemy's
hand
he
gave
his
people
over
also
unto
the
sword
and
was
wroth
with
his
inheritance
the
fire
consumed
their
young
men
and
their
maidens
were
not
given
to
marriage
their
priests
fell
by
the
sword
and
their
widows
made
no
lamentation
then
the
lord
awaked
as
one
out
of
sleep
and
like
a
mighty
man
that
shouteth
by
reason
of
wine
and
he
smote
his
enemies
in
the
hinder
parts
he
put
them
to
a
perpetual
reproach
moreover
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
joseph
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
ephraim
but
chose
the
tribe
of
judah
the
mount
zion
which
he
loved
and
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
high
palaces
like
the
earth
which
he
hath
established
for
ever
he
chose
david
also
his
servant
and
took
him
from
the
sheepfolds
from
following
the
ewes
great
with
young
he
brought
him
to
feed
jacob
his
people
and
israel
his
inheritance
so
he
fed
them
according
to
the
integrity
of
his
heart
and
guided
them
by
the
skilfulness
of
his
hands
o
god
the
heathen
are
come
into
thine
inheritance
thy
holy
temple
have
they
defiled
they
have
laid
jerusalem
on
heaps
the
dead
bodies
of
thy
servants
have
they
given
to
be
meat
unto
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
the
flesh
of
thy
saints
unto
the
beasts
of
the
earth
their
blood
have
they
shed
like
water
round
about
jerusalem
and
there
was
none
to
bury
them
we
are
become
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours
a
scorn
and
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us
how
long
lord
wilt
thou
be
angry
for
ever
shall
thy
jealousy
burn
like
fire
pour
out
thy
wrath
upon
the
heathen
that
have
not
known
thee
and
upon
the
kingdoms
that
have
not
called
upon
thy
name
for
they
have
devoured
jacob
and
laid
waste
his
dwelling
place
o
remember
not
against
us
former
iniquities
let
thy
tender
mercies
speedily
prevent
us
for
we
are
brought
very
low
help
us
o
god
of
our
salvation
for
the
glory
of
thy
name
and
deliver
us
and
purge
away
our
sins
for
thy
name's
sake
wherefore
should
the
heathen
say
where
is
their
god
let
him
be
known
among
the
heathen
in
our
sight
by
the
revenging
of
the
blood
of
thy
servants
which
is
shed
let
the
sighing
of
the
prisoner
come
before
thee
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
power
preserve
thou
those
that
are
appointed
to
die
and
render
unto
our
neighbours
sevenfold
into
their
bosom
their
reproach
wherewith
they
have
reproached
thee
o
lord
so
we
thy
people
and
sheep
of
thy
pasture
will
give
thee
thanks
for
ever
we
will
shew
forth
thy
praise
to
all
generations
give
ear
o
shepherd
of
israel

that
leadest
joseph
like
a
flock

that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
shine
forth
before
ephraim
and
benjamin
and
manasseh
stir
up
thy
strength
and
come
and
save
us
turn
us
again
o
god
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
o
lord
god
of
hosts
how
long
wilt
thou
be
angry
against
the
prayer
of
thy
people
thou
feedest
them
with
the
bread
of
tears
and
givest
them
tears
to
drink
in
great
measure
thou
makest
us
a
strife
unto
our
neighbours
and
our
enemies
laugh
among
themselves
turn
us
again
o
god
of
hosts
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
thou
hast
brought
a
vine
out
of
egypt
thou
hast
cast
out
the
heathen
and
planted
it
thou
preparedst
room
before
it
and
didst
cause
it
to
take
deep
root
and
it
filled
the
land
the
hills
were
covered
with
the
shadow
of
it
and
the
boughs
thereof
were
like
the
goodly
cedars
she
sent
out
her
boughs
unto
the
sea
and
her
branches
unto
the
river
why
hast
thou
then
broken
down
her
hedges
so
that
all
they
which
pass
by
the
way
do
pluck
her
the
boar
out
of
the
wood
doth
waste
it
and
the
wild
beast
of
the
field
doth
devour
it
return
we
beseech
thee
o
god
of
hosts
look
down
from
heaven
and
behold
and
visit
this
vine
and
the
vineyard
which
thy
right
hand
hath
planted
and
the
branch
that
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself
it
is
burned
with
fire
it
is
cut
down
they
perish
at
the
rebuke
of
thy
countenance
let
thy
hand
be
upon
the
man
of
thy
right
hand
upon
the
son
of
man
whom
thou
madest
strong
for
thyself
so
will
not
we
go
back
from
thee
quicken
us
and
we
will
call
upon
thy
name
turn
us
again
o
lord
god
of
hosts
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved

in
the
time
appointed
on
our
solemn
feast
day
for
this
was
a
statute
for
israel
and
a
law
of
the
god
of
jacob
this
he
ordained
in
joseph
for
a
testimony
when
he
went
out
through
the
land
of
egypt
where
i
heard
a
language
that
i
understood
not
i
removed
his
shoulder
from
the
burden
his
hands
were
delivered
from
the
pots
thou
calledst
in
trouble
and
i
delivered
thee
i
answered
thee
in
the
secret
place
of
thunder
i
proved
thee
at
the
waters
of
meribah
selah
hear
o
my
people
and
i
will
testify
unto
thee
o
israel
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
me
there

no
strange
god
be
in
thee
neither
shalt
thou
worship
any
strange
god

god
which

thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt

thy
mouth
wide
and
i
will
fill
it
but
my
people
would
not
hearken
to
my
voice
and
israel
would
none
of
me
so
i
gave
them
up
unto
their
own
hearts
lust
and
they
walked
in
their
own
counsels
oh
that
my
people
had
hearkened
unto
me
and
israel
had
walked
in
my
ways
i
should
soon
have
subdued
their
enemies
and
turned
my
hand
against
their
adversaries
the
haters
of
the
lord
should
have
submitted
themselves
unto
him
but
their
time
should
have
endured
for
ever
he
should
have
fed
them
also
with
the
finest
of
the
wheat
and
with
honey
out
of

rock
should
i
have
satisfied
thee

cut
them
off
from

a
nation
that
the

take
to
ourselves
the
houses
of

in

o
my
god
make
them
like
a
wheel
as
the
stubble
before
the
wind
as
the
fire
burneth
a
wood
and
as
the
flame
setteth
the
mountains
on

so
persecute
them

hast
been
wroth
with
thine
anointed
thou
hast
made
void
the
covenant
of
thy
servant
thou
hast
profaned
his
crown
by
casting
it
to
the
ground
thou
hast
broken
down
all
his
hedges
thou
hast
brought
his
strong
holds
to

hast
made
all
his
enemies
to
rejoice
thou
hast
also
turned
the
edge
of
his
sword
and
hast
not
made
him
to
stand
in
the
battle
thou
hast
made
his
glory
to
cease
and
cast
his
throne
down
to
the
ground
the
days
of
his
youth
hast
thou
shortened

hast
covered
him
with
shame

thou
hide
thyself
for

thy
wrath
burn
like

thou
made
all
men

hadst
formed
the
earth
and

thou
art
god
thou
turnest
man
to
destruction
and

a
thousand
years
in
thy
sight

but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past
and
as
a
watch
in
the
night
thou
carriest
them
away
as
with
a
flood
they
are
as
a
sleep
in
the
morning
they
are
like
grass
which
groweth
up
in
the
morning
it
flourisheth
and
groweth
up
in
the
evening
it
is
cut
down
and
withereth
for
we
are
consumed
by
thine
anger
and
by
thy
wrath
are
we
troubled
thou
hast
set
our
iniquities
before
thee
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
for
all
our
days
are
passed
away
in
thy
wrath
we
spend
our
years
as
a
tale
that
is
told
the
days
of
our
years
are
threescore
years
and
ten
and
if
by
reason
of
strength
they
be
fourscore
years
yet
is
their
strength
labour
and
sorrow
for
it
is
soon
cut
off
and
we
fly
away
who
knoweth
the
power
of
thine
anger
even
according
to
thy
fear
so
is
thy
wrath
so
teach
us
to
number
our
days
that
we
may
apply
our
hearts
unto
wisdom
return
o
lord
how
long
and
let
it
repent
thee
concerning
thy
servants
o

us
early
with
thy
mercy
that
we
may
rejoice
and
be
glad

our
days

the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
us
and

the
beauty
of

he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
i
will
say
of
the
lord
he
is
my
refuge
and
my
fortress
my
god
in
him
will
i
trust
surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
a
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
side
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
hand
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
thee
only
with
thine
eyes
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
wicked
because
thou
hast
made
the
lord
which
is
my
refuge
even
the
most
high
thy
habitation
there
shall
no
evil
befall
thee
neither
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
dwelling
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
they
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
hands
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
thou
shalt
tread
upon
the
lion
and
adder
the
young
lion
and
the
dragon
shalt
thou
trample
under
feet
because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
me
therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
set
him
on
high
because
he
hath
known
my
name

shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
answer
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
trouble

will
deliver
him
and
honour
him
with
long
life

i
satisfy
him
and
shew
him
my
salvation

is
a
good
thing
to
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
and
to
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
o
most
high
to
shew
forth
thy
lovingkindness
in
the
morning
and
thy
faithfulness
every
night
upon
an
instrument
of
ten
strings
and
upon
the
psaltery
upon
the
harp
with
a
solemn
sound
for
thou
lord
hast
made
me
glad
through
thy
work
i
will
triumph
in
the
works
of
thy
hands
o
lord
how
great
are
thy
works
and
thy
thoughts
are
very
deep
a
brutish
man
knoweth
not
neither
doth
a
fool
understand
this
when
the
wicked
spring
as
the
grass
and
when
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
do
flourish
it
is
that
they
shall
be
destroyed
for
ever
but

lord
art
most
high
for
evermore
for
lo
thine
enemies
o
lord
for
lo
thine
enemies
shall
perish
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
shall
be
scattered
but
my
horn
shalt
thou
exalt
like
the
horn
of
an
unicorn
i
shall
be
anointed
with
fresh
oil
mine
eye
also
shall
see
my
desire
on
mine
enemies
and
mine
ears
shall
hear
my
desire
of
the
wicked
that
rise
up
against
me
the
righteous
shall
flourish
like
the
palm
tree
he
shall
grow
like
a
cedar
in
lebanon
those
that
be
planted
in
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
flourish
in
the
courts
of
our
god
they
shall
still
bring
forth
fruit
in
old
age
they
shall
be
fat
and
flourishing
to
shew
that
the
lord
is
upright
he
is
my
rock
and
there
is
no
unrighteousness
in
him
the
lord
reigneth
he
is
clothed
with

the
lord
on

waters
yea

the
mighty
waves
of
the
sea
thy
testimonies
are
very
sure
holiness
becometh
thine
house
o
lord
for

o
lord

to
whom
vengeance
belongeth
o

of
the
earth

a
reward
to
the
proud
lord
how
long
shall
the
wicked
how
long
shall
the
wicked
triumph
how
long
shall
they
utter
and
speak
hard
things
and
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
boast
themselves
they
break
in
pieces
thy
people
o
lord
and
afflict
thine
heritage
they
slay
the
widow
and
the
stranger
and

the
fatherless

the
god
of
jacob
regard

ye
brutish
among
the
people
and
ye
fools
when

the
man
whom
thou
chastenest
o

him
out

thy
law
that
thou
mayest
give
him
rest
from
the
days
of
adversity
until

pit
be
digged
for

wicked
for

off
his
people

forsake
his
inheritance
but
judgment
shall
return
unto
righteousness
and

will
rise
up
for
me
against

evildoers
or
who
will
stand
up
for
me
against

had
been
my
help

almost
dwelt

silence
when
i
said
my
foot
slippeth
thy
mercy
o
lord
held
me
up
in
the
multitude
of
my
thoughts
within
me
thy
comforts
delight
my
soul
shall
the
throne
of
iniquity
have
fellowship
with
thee
which
frameth
mischief
by
a
law
they
gather
themselves
together
against
the
soul
of
the
righteous
and
condemn
the
innocent
blood
but
the
lord
is
my
defence
and
my
god
is
the
rock
of
my
refuge
and
he
shall
bring
upon
them
their
own
iniquity
and
shall
cut
them
off
in
their
own
wickedness
yea
the
lord
our
god
shall
cut
them
off

burned
as

hearth

smitten
and
withered
like
grass
so
that
i
forget
to
eat
my
bread
by

the
voice
of
my
groaning
my
bones
cleave
to

skin
i
am
like
a
pelican
of
the
wilderness
i
am
like
an
owl
of
the
desert
i
watch
and
am
as
a
sparrow
alone
upon
the
house
top
mine
enemies
reproach
me
all
the
day
and
they
that
are
mad
against
me
are
sworn
against
me
for
i
have
eaten
ashes
like
bread
and
mingled
my
drink
with
weeping
because
of
thine
indignation
and
thy
wrath
for
thou
hast
lifted
me
up
and
cast
me
down
my
days
are
like
a
shadow
that
declineth
and
i
am
withered
like
grass
but
thou
o
lord
shall
endure
for
ever
and
thy
remembrance
unto
all
generations
thou
shalt
arise
and
have
mercy
upon
zion
for
the
time
to
favour
her
yea
the
set
time
is
come
for
thy
servants
take
pleasure
in
her
stones
and
favour
the
dust
thereof
so
the
heathen
shall
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
thy
glory
when
the
lord
shall
build
up
zion
he
shall
appear
in
his
glory
he
will
regard
the
prayer
of
the
destitute
and
not
despise
their
prayer
this
shall
be
written
for
the
generation
to
come
and
the
people
which
shall
be
created
shall
praise
the
lord
for
he
hath
looked
down
from
the
height
of
his
sanctuary
from
heaven
did
the
lord
behold
the
earth
to
hear
the
groaning
of
the
prisoner
to
loose
those
that
are
appointed
to
death
to
declare
the
name
of
the
lord
in
zion
and
his
praise
in
jerusalem
when
the
people
are
gathered
together
and
the
kingdoms
to
serve
the
lord
he
weakened
my
strength
in
the
way
he
shortened
my
days
i
said
o
my
god
take
me
not
away
in
the
midst
of
my
days
thy
years
are
throughout
all
generations
of
old
hast
thou
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
work
of
thy
hands
they
shall
perish
but
thou
shalt
endure
yea
all
of
them
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
change
them
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
have
no
end
the
children
of
thy
servants
shall
continue
and
their
seed
shall
be
established
before
thee
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
bless
his
holy
name
bless
the
lord
o
my
soul
and
forget
not
all
his
benefits
who
forgiveth
all
thine
iniquities
who
healeth
all
thy
diseases
who
redeemeth
thy
life
from
destruction
who
crowneth
thee
with
lovingkindness
and
tender
mercies
who
satisfieth
thy
mouth
with
good
things
so
that
thy
youth
is
renewed
like
the
eagle's
the
lord
executeth
righteousness
and
judgment
for
all
that
are
oppressed
he
made
known
his
ways
unto
moses
his
acts
unto
the
children
of
israel
the
lord
is
merciful
and
gracious
slow
to
anger
and
plenteous
in
mercy
he
will
not
always
chide
neither
will
he
keep
his
anger
for
ever
he
hath
not
dealt
with
us
after
our
sins
nor
rewarded
us
according
to
our
iniquities
for
as
the
heaven
is
high
above
the
earth
so
great
is
his
mercy
toward
them
that
fear
him
as
far
as
the
east
is
from
the
west
so
far
hath
he
removed
our
transgressions
from
us
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
lord
pitieth
them
that
fear
him
for
he
knoweth
our
frame
he
remembereth
that
we
are
dust
as
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
as
a
flower
of
the
field
so
he
flourisheth
for
the
wind
passeth
over
it
and
it
is
gone
and
the
place
thereof
shall
know
it
no
more
but
the
mercy
of
the
lord
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
upon
them
that
fear
him
and
his
righteousness
unto
children's
children
to
such
as
keep
his
covenant
and
to
those
that
remember
his
commandments
to
do
them
the
lord
hath
prepared
his
throne
in
the

and
his
kingdom
ruleth
over
all

out
the

who
walketh
upon

a
flaming
fire
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
that
it
should
not
be
removed
for
ever
thou
coveredst
it
with
the
deep
as
with
a
garment
the
waters
stood
above
the
mountains
at
thy
rebuke
they
fled
at
the
voice
of
thy
thunder
they
hasted
away
they
go
up
by
the
mountains
they
go
down
by
the
valleys
unto
the
place
which
thou
hast
founded
for
them
thou
hast
set
a
bound
that
they
may
not
pass
over
that
they
turn
not
again
to
cover
the
earth
he
sendeth
the
springs
into
the
valleys
which
run
among
the
hills
they
give
drink
to
every
beast
of
the
field
the
wild
asses
quench
their
thirst
by
them
shall
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
have
their
habitation
which
sing
among
the
branches
he
watereth
the
hills
from
his
chambers
the
earth
is
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
thy
works
he
causeth
the
grass
to
grow
for
the
cattle
and
herb
for
the
service
of
man
that
he
may
bring
forth
food
out
of
the
earth
and
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
and
oil
to
make
his
face
to
shine
and

which
strengtheneth
man's
heart
the
trees
of
the
lord
are
full
of
sap
the
cedars
of
lebanon
which
he
hath
planted
where
the
birds
make
their
nests
as
for

sun
knoweth
his
going
down
thou
makest
darkness
and
it
is
night
wherein
all
the
beasts
of

forest
do
creep
forth
the
young
lions
roar
after
their
prey
and
seek
their
meat
from

the
sun
ariseth
they
gather
themselves
together
and
lay
them
down
in
their
dens
man
goeth
forth
unto
his
work
and
to
his
labour

the
evening
o
lord
how
manifold
are
thy
works

wisdom

thou
made
them

full
of
thy
riches

sea
wherein

things
creeping
innumerable
both

beasts
there

ships
there
is
that
leviathan
whom
thou
hast
made
to

all
upon
thee
that
thou
mayest
give
them
their
meat
in
due
season
that
thou
givest
them

thou
openest
thine
hand
they
are
filled
with
good
thou
hidest
thy
face
they
are
troubled
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
and

of
jacob
his
chosen
he
is
the
lord
our
god
his
judgments
are
in
all
the
earth
he
hath
remembered
his
covenant
for
ever
the
word
which
he
commanded
to
a
thousand
generations
which
covenant
he
made
with
abraham
and
his
oath
unto
isaac
and
confirmed
the
same
unto
jacob
for
a
law
and
to
israel
for
an
everlasting
covenant
saying
unto
thee
will
i
give
the
land
of
canaan
the
lot
of
your
inheritance
when
they
were
but
a
few
men
in
number
yea
very
few
and
strangers
in
it
when
they
went
from
one
nation
to
another
from
one
kingdom
to
another
people
he
suffered
no
man
to
do
them
wrong
yea
he
reproved
kings
for
their
sakes
saying
touch
not
mine
anointed
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm
moreover
he
called
for
a
famine
upon
the
land
he
brake
the
whole
staff
of
bread
he
sent
a
man
before
them
even
joseph
who
was
sold
for
a
servant
whose
feet
they
hurt
with
fetters
he
was
laid
in
iron
until
the
time
that
his
word
came
the
word
of
the
lord
tried
him
the
king
sent
and
loosed
him
even
the
ruler
of
the
people
and
let
him
go
free
he
made
him
lord
of
his
house
and
ruler
of
all
his
substance
to
bind
his
princes
at
his
pleasure
and
teach
his
senators
wisdom
israel
also
came
into
egypt
and
jacob
sojourned
in
the
land
of
ham
and
he
increased
his
people
greatly
and
made
them
stronger
than
their
enemies
he
turned
their
heart
to
hate
his
people
to
deal
subtilly
with
his
servants
he
sent
moses
his
servant
and
aaron
whom
he
had
chosen
they
shewed
his
signs
among
them
and
wonders
in
the
land
of
ham
he
sent
darkness
and
made
it
dark
and
they
rebelled
not
against
his
word
he
turned
their
waters
into
blood
and
slew
their
fish
their
land
brought
forth
frogs
in
abundance
in
the
chambers
of
their
kings
he
spake
and
there
came
divers
sorts
of
flies
and
lice
in
all
their
coasts
he
gave
them
hail
for
rain
and
flaming
fire
in
their
land
he
smote
their
vines
also
and
their
fig
trees
and
brake
the
trees
of
their
coasts
he
spake
and
the
locusts
came
and
caterpillers
and
that
without
number
and
did
eat
up
all
the
herbs
in
their
land
and
devoured
the
fruit
of
their
ground
he
smote
also
all
the
firstborn
in
their
land
the
chief
of
all
their
strength
he
brought
them
forth
also
with
silver
and
gold
and
there
was
not
one
feeble
person
among
their
tribes
egypt
was
glad
when
they
departed
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
them
he
spread
a
cloud
for
a
covering
and
fire
to
give
light
in
the
night
the
people
asked
and
he
brought
quails
and
satisfied
them
with
the
bread
of
heaven
he
opened
the
rock
and
the
waters
gushed
out
they
ran
in
the
dry
places
like
a
river
for
he
remembered
his
holy
promise
and
abraham
his
servant
and
he
brought
forth
his
people
with
joy
and
his
chosen
with
gladness
and
gave
them
the
lands
of
the
heathen
and
they
inherited
the
labour
of
the
people
that
they
might
observe
his
statutes
and
keep
his
laws
praise
ye
the
lord
praise
ye
the
lord
o
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
who
can
utter
the
mighty
acts
of
the
lord
who
can
shew
forth
all
his
praise
blessed
are
they
that
keep
judgment
and
he
that
doeth
righteousness
at
all
times
remember
me
o
lord
with
the
favour
that
thou
bearest
unto
thy
people
o
visit
me
with
thy
salvation
that
i
may
see
the
good
of
thy
chosen
that
i
may
rejoice
in
the
gladness
of
thy
nation
that
i
may
glory
with
thine
inheritance
we
have
sinned
with
our
fathers
we
have
committed
iniquity
we
have
done
wickedly
our
fathers
understood
not
thy
wonders
in
egypt
they
remembered
not
the
multitude
of
thy
mercies
but
provoked
him
at
the
sea
even
at
the
red
sea
nevertheless
he
saved
them
for
his
name's
sake
that
he
might
make
his
mighty
power
to
be
known
he
rebuked
the
red
sea
also
and
it
was
dried
up
so
he
led
them
through
the
depths
as
through
the
wilderness
and
he
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
him
that
hated
them
and
redeemed
them
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
the
waters
covered
their
enemies
there
was
not
one
of
them
left
then
believed
they
his
words
they
sang
his
praise
they
soon
forgat
his
works
they
waited
not
for
his
counsel
but
lusted
exceedingly
in
the
wilderness
and
tempted
god
in
the
desert
and
he
gave
them
their
request
but
sent
leanness
into
their
soul
they
envied
moses
also
in
the
camp
and
aaron
the
saint
of
the
lord
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
dathan
and
covered
the
company
of
abiram
and
a
fire
was
kindled
in
their
company
the
flame
burned
up
the
wicked
they
made
a
calf
in
horeb
and
worshipped
the
molten
image
thus
they
changed
their
glory
into
the
similitude
of
an
ox
that
eateth
grass
they
forgat
god
their
saviour
which
had
done
great
things
in
egypt
wondrous
works
in
the
land
of
ham
and
terrible
things
by
the
red
sea
therefore
he
said
that
he
would
destroy
them
had
not
moses
his
chosen
stood
before
him
in
the
breach
to
turn
away
his
wrath
lest
he
should
destroy
them
yea
they
despised
the
pleasant
land
they
believed
not
his
word
but
murmured
in
their
tents
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
therefore
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
them
to
overthrow
them
in
the
wilderness
to
overthrow
their
seed
also
among
the
nations
and
to
scatter
them
in
the
lands
they
joined
themselves
also
unto
baalpeor
and
ate
the
sacrifices
of
the
dead
thus
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
inventions
and
the
plague
brake
in
upon
them
then
stood
up
phinehas
and
executed
judgment
and
so
the
plague
was
stayed
and
that
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
unto
all
generations
for
evermore
they
angered
him
also
at
the
waters
of
strife
so
that
it
went
ill
with
moses
for
their
sakes
because
they
provoked
his
spirit
so
that
he
spake
unadvisedly
with
his
lips
they
did
not
destroy
the
nations
concerning
whom
the
lord
commanded
them
but
were
mingled
among
the
heathen
and
learned
their
works
and
they
served
their
idols
which
were
a
snare
unto
them
yea
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
devils
and
shed
innocent
blood
even
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
daughters
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
canaan
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
blood
thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
works
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
inventions
therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
inheritance
and
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
heathen
and
they
that
hated
them
ruled
over
them
their
enemies
also
oppressed
them
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
under
their
hand
many
times
did
he
deliver
them
but
they
provoked
him
with
their
counsel
and
were
brought
low
for
their
iniquity
nevertheless
he
regarded
their
affliction
when
he
heard
their
cry
and
he
remembered
for
them
his
covenant
and
repented
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
mercies
he
made
them
also
to
be
pitied
of
all
those
that
carried
them
captives
save
us
o
lord
our
god
and
gather
us
from
among
the
heathen
to
give
thanks
unto
thy
holy
name
and
to
triumph
in
thy
praise
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
and
let
all
the
people
say
amen
praise
ye
the
lord
o
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
let
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
say
so
whom
he
hath
redeemed
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
gathered
them
out
of
the
lands
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
they
wandered
in
the
wilderness
in
a
solitary
way
they
found
no
city
to
dwell
in
hungry
and
thirsty
their
soul
fainted
in
them
then
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
delivered
them
out
of
their
distresses
and
he
led
them
forth
by
the
right
way
that
they
might
go
to
a
city
of
habitation
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
for
he
satisfieth
the
longing
soul
and
filleth
the
hungry
soul
with
goodness
such
as
sit
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
being
bound
in
affliction
and
iron
because
they
rebelled
against
the
words
of
god
and
contemned
the
counsel
of
the
most
high
therefore
he
brought
down
their
heart
with
labour
they
fell
down
and
there
was
none
to
help
then
they
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
saved
them
out
of
their
distresses
he
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
and
brake
their
bands
in
sunder
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
for
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
brass
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
sunder
fools
because
of
their
transgression
and
because
of
their
iniquities
are
afflicted
their
soul
abhorreth
all
manner
of
meat
and
they
draw
near
unto
the
gates
of
death
then
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
saveth
them
out
of
their
distresses
he
sent
his
word
and
healed
them
and
delivered
them
from
their
destructions
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
and
let
them
sacrifice
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving
and
declare
his
works
with
rejoicing
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
that
do
business
in
great
waters
these
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
for
he
commandeth
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
thereof
they
mount
up
to
the
heaven
they
go
down
again
to
the
depths
their
soul
is
melted
because
of
trouble
they
reel
to
and
fro
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
and
are
at
their
wit's
end
then
they
cry
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
bringeth
them
out
of
their
distresses
he
maketh
the
storm
a
calm
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
still
then
are
they
glad
because
they
be
quiet
so
he
bringeth
them
unto
their
desired
haven
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
let
them
exalt
him
also
in
the
congregation
of
the
people
and
praise
him
in
the
assembly
of
the
elders
he
turneth
rivers
into
a
wilderness
and
the
watersprings
into
dry
ground
a
fruitful
land
into
barrenness
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein
he
turneth
the
wilderness
into
a
standing
water
and
dry
ground
into
watersprings
and
there
he
maketh
the
hungry
to
dwell
that
they
may
prepare
a
city
for
habitation
and
sow
the
fields
and
plant
vineyards
which
may
yield
fruits
of
increase
he
blesseth
them
also
so
that
they
are
multiplied
greatly
and
suffereth
not
their
cattle
to
decrease
again
they
are
minished
and
brought
low
through
oppression
affliction
and
sorrow
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way
yet
setteth
he
the
poor
on
high
from
affliction
and
maketh
him
families
like
a
flock
the
righteous
shall
see
it
and
rejoice
and
all
iniquity
shall
stop
her
mouth
whoso
is
wise

for

they
are
my
adversaries

i
give
myself
unto

and
they
have
rewarded
me
evil
for
good
and
hatred
for
my
love
set
thou
a
wicked
man
over
him
and
let
satan
stand
at

when

shall
be
judged
let
him
be
condemned
and
let
his
prayer
become
sin
let
his
days
be
few
and
let
another
take
his
office
let
his

be
fatherless
and

be
continually
vagabonds
and

to

be
cut
off
and
in
the
generation
following
let

be
blotted
out
let
the

with
the
lord
and

not
the
sin
of
his
mother
be
blotted
out
let
them
be
before
the
lord
continually
that
he
may
cut
off
the
memory
of
them
from
the
earth
because
that
he
remembered
not
to
shew
mercy
but
persecuted
the
poor
and
needy
man
that
he
might
even
slay
the
broken
in
heart
as
he
loved
cursing
so
let
it
come
unto

as
he
delighted
not
in
blessing
so
let
it
be
far
from
him
as
he
clothed
himself
with
cursing
like
as
with
his
garment
so
let
it
come
into
his
bowels
like
water
and
like
oil
into

unto
him
as
the
garment
which
covereth
him

for
a
girdle
wherewith
he
is
girded
continually
let
this
be
the
reward
of
mine
adversaries
from
the
lord

of
them
that

evil
against
my
soul

thou
for
me
o

for
thy
name's

thy
mercy

thou
me
for

me
i
am
gone

weak
through
fasting
and

fail
for
thy
word
saying

day

thine
ordinances
for

servants

thou
hast
quickened
me

am
thine
save
me
for

waited
for
me
to
destroy
me
but
i
will
consider
thy
testimonies

seen
an
end
of
all
perfection
but
thy
commandment
is
exceeding
broad
o
how
i
love
thy
law
it
is
my
meditation
all
the
day
thou
through
thy
commandments
hast
made
me
wiser
than
mine
enemies
for
they
are
ever
with
me
i
have
more
understanding
than
all
my
teachers
for
thy
testimonies
are
my
meditation
i
understand
more
than
the
ancients
because
i
keep
thy
precepts
i
have
refrained
my
feet
from
every
evil
way
that
i
might
keep
thy
word
i
have
not
departed
from
thy
judgments
for
thou
hast
taught
me
how
sweet
are
thy
words
unto
my
taste
yea
sweeter
than
honey
to
my
mouth
through
thy
precepts
i
get
understanding
therefore
i
hate
every
false
way
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
i
have
sworn
and
i
will
perform
it
that
i
will
keep
thy
righteous
judgments
i
am
afflicted
very
much
quicken
me
o
lord
according
unto
thy
word
accept
i
beseech
thee
the
freewill
offerings
of
my
mouth
o
lord
and
teach
me
thy
judgments
my
soul
is
continually
in
my
hand
yet
do
i
not
forget
thy
law
the
wicked
have
laid
a
snare
for
me
yet
i
erred
not
from
thy
precepts
thy
testimonies
have
i
taken
as
an
heritage
for
ever
for
they
are
the
rejoicing
of
my
heart
i
have
inclined
mine
heart
to
perform
thy
statutes
alway
even
unto
the
end
i
hate
vain
thoughts
but
thy
law
do
i
love
thou
art
my
hiding
place
and
my
shield
i
hope
in
thy
word
depart
from
me
ye
evildoers
for
i
will
keep
the
commandments
of
my
god
uphold
me
according
unto
thy
word
that
i
may
live
and
let
me
not
be
ashamed
of
my
hope
hold
thou
me
up
and
i
shall
be
safe
and
i
will
have
respect
unto
thy
statutes
continually
thou
hast
trodden
down
all
them
that
err
from
thy
statutes
for
their
deceit
is
falsehood
thou
puttest
away
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
like
dross
therefore
i
love
thy
testimonies
my
flesh
trembleth
for
fear
of
thee
and
i
am
afraid
of

is
me
that
i
sojourn
in

that

dwell
in
the
tents
of
kedar
my
soul
hath
long
dwelt
with
him
that

i
am
for

they

war
i
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence

my
help
my
help

from
the
lord
which
made
heaven
and
earth
he
will
not

thy
foot
to
be

that
keepeth

neither
slumber
nor

thy
shade
upon
thy
right
hand

thee
by

nor
the
moon
by
night
the
lord

preserve
thee
from
all
evil
he
shall
preserve
thy
soul
the
lord
shall
preserve
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
from
this
time
forth
and
even
for
evermore
i
was
glad
when
they
said
unto
me
let
us
go
into
the
house
of
the
lord
our
feet
shall
stand
within
thy
gates
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
is
builded
as
a
city
that
is
compact
together
whither
the
tribes
go
up
the
tribes
of
the
lord
unto
the
testimony
of
israel
to
give
thanks
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
for
there
are
set
thrones
of
judgment
the
thrones
of
the
house
of
david
pray
for
the
peace
of
jerusalem
they
shall
prosper
that
love
thee
peace
be
within
thy
walls
and
prosperity
within
thy
palaces
for
my
brethren
and
companions
sakes
i
will
now
say
peace
be
within
thee
because
of
the
house
of
the
lord
our
god
i
will
seek
thy
good
unto
thee
lift
i
up
mine
eyes
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
heavens
behold
as
the
eyes
of
servants
look
unto
the
hand
of
their
masters
and
as
the
eyes
of
a
maiden
unto
the
hand
of
her
mistress
so
our
eyes
wait
upon
the
lord
our
god
until
that
he
have
mercy
upon
us
have
mercy
upon
us
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
for
we
are
exceedingly
filled
with
contempt
our
soul
is
exceedingly
filled
with
the
scorning
of
those
that
are
at
ease
and
with
the
contempt
of
the
proud
if
it
had
not
been
the
lord
who
was
on
our
side
now
may
israel
say
if
it
had
not
been
the
lord
who
was
on
our
side
when
men
rose
up
against
us
then
they
had
swallowed
us
up
quick
when
their
wrath
was
kindled
against
us
then
the
waters
had
overwhelmed
us
the
stream
had
gone
over
our
soul
then
the
proud
waters
had
gone
over
our
soul
blessed
be
the
lord
who
hath
not
given
us
as
a
prey
to
their
teeth
our
soul
is
escaped
as
a
bird
out
of
the
snare
of
the
fowlers
the
snare
is
broken
and
we
are
escaped
our
help
is
in
the
name
of
the
lord
who
made
heaven
and
earth
they
that
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
as
mount
zion
which
cannot
be
removed
but
abideth
for
ever
as
the
mountains
are
round
about
jerusalem
so
the
lord
is
round
about
his
people
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
for
the
rod
of
the
wicked
shall
not
rest
upon
the
lot
of
the
righteous
lest
the
righteous
put
forth
their
hands
unto
iniquity
do
good
o
lord
unto
those
that
be
good
and
to
them
that
are
upright
in
their
hearts
as
for
such
as
turn
aside
unto
their
crooked
ways
the
lord
shall
lead
them
forth
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
but
peace
shall
be
upon
israel
when
the
lord
turned
again
the
captivity
of
zion
we
were
like
them
that
dream
then
was
our
mouth
filled
with
laughter
and
our
tongue
with
singing
then
said
they
among
the
heathen
the
lord
hath
done
great
things
for
them
the
lord
hath
done
great
things
for
us
whereof
we
are
glad
turn
again
our
captivity
o
lord
as
the
streams
in
the
south
they
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy
he
that
goeth
forth
and
weepeth
bearing
precious
seed
shall
doubtless
come
again
with
rejoicing
bringing
his
sheaves
with
him
except
the
lord
build
the
house
they
labour
in
vain
that
build
it
except
the
lord
keep
the
city
the
watchman
waketh
but
in
vain
it
is
vain
for
you
to
rise
up
early
to
sit
up
late
to
eat
the
bread
of
sorrows
for
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
lo
children
are
an
heritage
of
the
lord
and
the
fruit
of
the
womb
is
his
reward
as
arrows
are
in
the
hand
of
a
mighty
man
so
are
children
of
the
youth
happy
is
the
man
that
hath
his
quiver
full
of
them
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
but
they
shall
speak
with
the
enemies
in
the
gate
blessed
is
every
one
that
feareth
the
lord
that
walketh
in
his
ways
for
thou
shalt
eat
the
labour
of
thine
hands
happy
shalt
thou
be
and
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
thy
wife
shall
be
as
a
fruitful
vine
by
the
sides
of
thine
house
thy
children
like
olive
plants
round
about
thy
table
behold
that
thus
shall
the
man
be
blessed
that
feareth
the
lord
the
lord
shall
bless
thee
out
of
zion
and
thou
shalt
see
the
good
of
jerusalem
all
the
days
of
thy
life
yea
thou
shalt
see
thy
children's
children
and
peace
upon
israel
many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth
may
israel
now
say
many
a
time
have
they
afflicted
me
from
my
youth
yet
they
have
not
prevailed
against
me
the
plowers
plowed
upon
my
back
they
made
long
their
furrows
the
lord
is
righteous
he
hath
cut
asunder
the
cords
of
the
wicked
let
them
all
be
confounded
and
turned
back
that
hate
zion
let
them
be
as
the
grass
upon
the
housetops
which
withereth
afore
it
groweth
up
wherewith
the
mower
filleth
not
his
hand
nor
he
that
bindeth
sheaves
his
bosom
neither
do
they
which
go
by
say
the
blessing
of
the
lord
be
upon
you
we
bless
you
in
the
name
of
the
lord
out
of
the
depths
have
i
cried
unto
thee
o
lord
lord
hear
my
voice
let
thine
ears
be
attentive
to
the
voice
of
my
supplications
if
thou
lord
shouldest
mark
iniquities
o
lord
who
shall
stand
but
there
is
forgiveness
with
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
feared
i
wait
for
the
lord
my
soul
doth
wait
and
in
his
word
do
i
hope
my
soul
waiteth
for
the
lord
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning
i
say
more
than
they
that
watch
for
the
morning
let
israel
hope
in
the
lord
for
with
the
lord
there
is
mercy
and
with
him
is
plenteous
redemption
and
he
shall
redeem
israel
from
all
his
iniquities
lord
my
heart
is
not
haughty
nor
mine
eyes
lofty
neither
do
i
exercise
myself
in
great
matters
or
in
things
too
high
for
me
surely
i
have
behaved
and
quieted
myself
as
a
child
that
is
weaned
of
his
mother
my
soul
is
even
as
a
weaned
child
let
israel
hope
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
and
for
ever
lord
remember
david
and
all
his
afflictions
how
he
sware
unto
the
lord
and
vowed
unto
the
mighty
god
of
jacob
surely
i
will
not
come
into
the
tabernacle
of
my
house
nor
go
up
into
my
bed
i
will
not
give
sleep
to
mine
eyes
or
slumber
to
mine
eyelids
until
i
find
out
a
place
for
the
lord
an
habitation
for
the
mighty
god
of
jacob
lo
we
heard
of
it
at
ephratah
we
found
it
in
the
fields
of
the
wood
we
will
go
into
his
tabernacles
we
will
worship
at
his
footstool
arise
o
lord
into
thy
rest
thou
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength
let
thy
priests
be
clothed
with
righteousness
and
let
thy
saints
shout
for
joy
for
thy
servant
david's
sake
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed
the
lord
hath
sworn
in
truth
unto
david
he
will
not
turn
from
it
of
the
fruit
of
thy
body
will
i
set
upon
thy
throne
if
thy
children
will
keep
my
covenant
and
my
testimony
that
i
shall
teach
them
their
children
shall
also
sit
upon
thy
throne
for
evermore
for
the
lord
hath
chosen
zion
he
hath
desired
it
for
his
habitation
this
is
my
rest
for
ever
here
will
i
dwell
for
i
have
desired
it
i
will
abundantly
bless
her
provision
i
will
satisfy
her
poor
with
bread
i
will
also
clothe
her
priests
with
salvation
and
her
saints
shall
shout
aloud
for
joy
there
will
i
make
the
horn
of
david
to
bud
i
have
ordained
a
lamp
for
mine
anointed
his
enemies
will
i
clothe
with
shame
but
upon
himself
shall
his
crown
flourish
behold
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity
it
is
like
the
precious
ointment
upon
the
head
that
ran
down
upon
the
beard
even
aaron's
beard
that
went
down
to
the
skirts
of
his
garments
as
the
dew
of
hermon
and
as
the
dew
that
descended
upon
the
mountains
of
zion
for
there
the

commanded
the
blessing
even

for

yea
we
wept
when

remembered
zion
we
hanged
our
harps
upon
the
willows
in
the
midst
thereof
for
there
they
that
carried
us
away
captive
required
of
us
a
song
and
they
that
wasted
us
required
of
us
mirth
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
zion
how
shall
we
sing
the
lord's
song
in
a
strange

if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
let
my
right

forget
her
cunning
if
i
do
not
remember
thee
let
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of

if
i
prefer
not
jerusalem
above
my

joy
remember
o

the
children
of
edom
in
the
day
of

who
said
rase
it
rase
it
even
to
the
foundation
thereof
o
daughter
of
babylon
who
art
to
be
destroyed
happy
shall
he
be
that
rewardeth
thee
as
thou
hast
served
us
happy
shall
he
be
that
taketh
and
dasheth
thy
little
ones
against

praise
thee
with
my
whole
heart
before

unto
thee

will
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple
and
praise
thy
name
for
thy
lovingkindness
and
for
thy
truth
for
thou
hast
magnified
thy
word
above
all
thy
name
in
the
day
when
i
cried
thou
answeredst
me
and
strengthenedst
me
with
strength
in
my
soul
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
shall
praise
thee
o

sing
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
for
great
is
the
glory
of
the
lord
though
the
lord
be
high
yet
hath
he
respect
unto
the
lowly
but
the
proud
he
knoweth
afar
off
though
i
walk
in
the
midst
of
trouble
thou
wilt
revive
me
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thine
hand
against
the
wrath
of
mine
enemies
and
thy
right
hand
shall
save
me
the
lord
will
perfect
that
which
concerneth
me
thy
mercy
o
lord
endureth
for
ever
forsake
not
the
works
of
thine
own
hands
o
lord
thou
hast
searched
me
and
known
me
thou
knowest
my
downsitting
and
mine
uprising
thou
understandest
my
thought
afar
off
thou
compassest
my
path
and
my
lying
down
and
art
acquainted
with
all
my
ways
for
there
is
not
a
word
in
my
tongue
but
lo
o
lord
thou
knowest
it
altogether
thou
hast
beset
me
behind
and
before
and
laid
thine
hand
upon
me
such
knowledge
is
too
wonderful
for
me
it
is
high
i
cannot
attain
unto
it
whither
shall
i
go
from
thy
spirit
or
whither
shall
i
flee
from
thy
presence
if
i
ascend
up
into
heaven
thou
art
there
if
i
make
my
bed
in
hell
behold
thou
art
there
if
i
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
even
there
shall
thy
hand
lead
me
and
thy
right
hand
shall
hold
me
if
i
say
surely
the
darkness
shall
cover
me
even
the
night
shall
be
light
about
me
yea
the
darkness
hideth
not
from
thee
but
the
night
shineth
as
the
day
the
darkness
and
the
light
are
both
alike
to
thee
for
thou
hast
possessed
my
reins
thou
hast
covered
me
in
my
mother's
womb
i
will
praise
thee
for
i
am
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
marvellous
are
thy
works
and
that
my
soul
knoweth
right
well
my
substance
was
not
hid
from
thee
when
i
was
made
in
secret
and
curiously
wrought
in
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
thine
eyes
did
see
my
substance
yet
being
unperfect
and
in
thy
book
all
my
members
were
written
which
in
continuance
were
fashioned
when
as
yet
there
was
none
of
them
how
precious
also
are
thy
thoughts
unto
me
o
god
how
great
is
the
sum
of
them
if
i
should
count
them
they
are
more
in
number
than
the
sand
when
i
awake
i
am
still
with
thee
surely
thou
wilt
slay
the
wicked
o
god

from
me

to

to

to
receive
the
instruction
of

justice
and
judgment
and

to
give
subtilty
to
the
simple
to
the
young
man
knowledge
and
discretion
a
wise
man
will
hear
and
will
increase
learning
and
a
man
of
understanding
shall
attain
unto
wise
counsels
to
understand
a
proverb
and
the
interpretation
the
words
of
the
wise
and
their
dark
sayings
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
knowledge
but
fools
despise
wisdom
and
instruction
my
son
hear
the
instruction
of
thy
father
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother
for
they
shall
be
an
ornament
of

unto
thy

and
chains
about

my
son
if
sinners
entice
thee
consent
thou
not
if
they
say
come
with
us
let
us
lay
wait
for
blood
let
us
lurk
privily
for
the
innocent
without
cause
let
us
swallow
them
up
alive
as
the
grave
and
whole
as
those
that
go
down
into
the
pit
we
shall
find
all
precious
substance
we
shall
fill
our
houses
with
spoil
cast
in
thy

among
us
let
us
all
have
one
purse
my
son
walk
not
thou
in
the
way
with
them
refrain
thy
foot
from
their
path
for
their
feet
run
to
evil
and
make
haste
to
shed
blood
surely
in
vain
the
net
is
spread
in
the
sight
of
any
bird
and
they
lay
wait
for
their
own
blood
they
lurk
privily
for
their
own
lives
so
are
the
ways
of
every
one
that
is
greedy
of
gain
which
taketh
away
the
life
of
the
owners
thereof
wisdom
crieth
without
she
uttereth
her
voice
in
the
streets
she
crieth
in
the
chief
place
of
concourse
in
the
openings
of
the
gates
in
the
city
she
uttereth
her
words
saying
how
long
ye
simple
ones
will
ye
love
simplicity
and
the
scorners
delight
in
their
scorning
and
fools
hate
knowledge
turn
you
at
my
reproof
behold
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
unto
you
i
will
make
known
my
words
unto
you
because
i
have
called
and
ye
refused
i
have
stretched
out
my
hand
and
no
man
regarded
but
ye
have
set
at
nought
all
my
counsel
and
would
none
of
my
reproof
i
also
will
laugh
at
your
calamity
i
will
mock
when
your
fear
cometh
when
your
fear
cometh
as
desolation
and
your
destruction
cometh
as
a
whirlwind
when
distress
and
anguish
cometh
upon
you
then
shall
they
call
upon
me
but
i
will
not
answer
they
shall
seek
me
early
but
they
shall
not
find
me
for
that
they
hated
knowledge
and
did
not
choose
the
fear
of
the
lord
they
would
none
of
my
counsel
they
despised
all
my
reproof
therefore
shall
they
eat
of
the
fruit
of
their
own
way
and
be
filled
with
their
own
devices
for
the
turning
away
of
the
simple
shall
slay
them
and
the
prosperity
of
fools
shall
destroy
them
but
whoso
hearkeneth
unto
me
shall
dwell
safely
and
shall
be
quiet
from
fear
of
evil
my
son
if
thou
wilt
receive
my
words
and
hide
my
commandments
with
thee
so
that
thou
incline
thine
ear
unto
wisdom
and
apply
thine
heart
to
understanding
yea
if
thou
criest
after
knowledge
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding
if
thou
seekest
her
as
silver
and
searchest
for
her
as
for
hid
treasures
then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
find
the
knowledge
of
god
for
the
lord
giveth
wisdom
out
of
his
mouth
cometh
knowledge
and
understanding
he
layeth
up
sound
wisdom
for
the
righteous
he
is
a
buckler
to
them
that
walk
uprightly
he
keepeth
the
paths
of
judgment
and
preserveth
the
way
of
his
saints
then
shalt
thou
understand
righteousness
and
judgment
and
equity
yea
every
good
path
when
wisdom
entereth
into
thine
heart
and
knowledge
is
pleasant
unto
thy
soul
discretion
shall
preserve
thee
understanding
shall
keep
thee
to
deliver
thee
from
the
way
of
the
evil
man
from
the
man
that
speaketh
froward
things
who
leave
the
paths
of
uprightness
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
darkness
who
rejoice
to
do
evil
and
delight
in
the
frowardness
of
the
wicked
whose
ways
are
crooked
and
they
froward
in
their
paths
to
deliver
thee
from
the
strange
woman
even
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words
which
forsaketh
the
guide
of
her
youth
and
forgetteth
the
covenant
of
her
god
for
her
house
inclineth
unto
death
and
her
paths
unto
the
dead
none
that
go
unto
her
return
again
neither
take
they
hold
of
the
paths
of
life
that
thou
mayest
walk
in
the
way
of
good
men
and
keep
the
paths
of
the
righteous
for
the
upright
shall
dwell
in
the
land
and
the
perfect
shall
remain
in
it
but
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
earth
and
the
transgressors
shall
be
rooted
out
of
it
my
son
forget
not
my
law
but
let
thine
heart
keep
my
commandments
for
length
of
days
and
long
life
and
peace
shall
they
add
to
thee
let
not
mercy
and
truth
forsake
thee
bind
them
about
thy
neck
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart
so
shalt
thou
find
favour
and
good
understanding
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
trust
in
the
lord
with
all
thine
heart
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understanding
in
all
thy
ways
acknowledge
him
and
he
shall
direct
thy
paths
be
not
wise
in
thine
own
eyes
fear
the
lord
and
depart
from
evil
it
shall
be
health
to
thy
navel
and
marrow
to
thy
bones
honour
the
lord
with
thy
substance
and
with
the
firstfruits
of
all
thine
increase
so
shall
thy
barns
be
filled
with
plenty
and
thy
presses
shall
burst
out
with
new
wine
my
son
despise
not
the
chastening
of
the
lord
neither
be
weary
of
his
correction
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
correcteth
even
as
a
father
the
son
in
whom
he
delighteth
happy
is
the
man
that
findeth
wisdom
and
the
man
that
getteth
understanding
for
the
merchandise
of
it
is
better
than
the
merchandise
of
silver
and
the
gain
thereof
than
fine
gold
she
is
more
precious
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
thou
canst
desire
are
not
to
be
compared
unto
her
length
of
days
is
in
her
right
hand
and
in
her
left
hand
riches
and
honour
her
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
she
is
a
tree
of
life
to
them
that
lay
hold
upon
her
and
happy
is
every
one
that
retaineth
her
the
lord
by
wisdom
hath
founded
the
earth
by
understanding
hath
he
established
the
heavens
by
his
knowledge
the
depths
are
broken
up
and
the
clouds
drop
down
the
dew
my
son
let
not
them
depart
from
thine
eyes
keep
sound
wisdom
and
discretion
so
shall
they
be
life
unto
thy
soul
and
grace
to
thy
neck
then
shalt
thou
walk
in
thy
way
safely
and
thy
foot
shall
not
stumble
when
thou
liest
down
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
yea
thou
shalt
lie
down
and
thy
sleep
shall
be
sweet
be
not
afraid
of
sudden
fear
neither
of
the
desolation
of
the
wicked
when
it
cometh
for

from
them
to
whom

without
cause
if
he
have
done
thee
no
harm
envy
thou
not
the
oppressor
and
choose
none
of

but
his
secret
is
with
the
righteous
the
curse
of
the
lord
is
in
the
house
of
the
wicked
but
he
blesseth
the
habitation
of
the
just
surely
he
scorneth
the
scorners
but
he
giveth
grace
unto
the
lowly
the

and

the
way
of
evil
men

it

not
by
it
turn
from
it
and
pass
away
for
they
sleep
not
except
they
have
done
mischief
and
their
sleep
is
taken
away
unless
they
cause
some
to
fall
for
they
eat
the
bread
of
wickedness
and
drink
the
wine
of
violence
but
the
path
of
the
just
is
as
the
shining
light
that
shineth
more
and
more
unto
the
perfect
day
the
way
of
the

with
all
diligence
for
out
of
it
are
the
issues
of
life
put
away
from
thee
a
froward
mouth
and
perverse
lips
put
far
from
thee
let
thine
eyes
look
right
on
and

eyelids
look
straight
before
thee
ponder
the

remove
thy
foot
from

my
son
attend
unto
my
wisdom
and
bow
thine
ear
to
my
understanding
that
thou
mayest
regard
discretion
and
that
thy
lips
may
keep
knowledge
for
the
lips
of
a
strange
woman
drop
as
an
honeycomb
and
her
mouth
is
smoother
than
oil
but
her
end
is
bitter
as
wormwood
sharp
as
a
two-edged
sword
her
feet
go
down
to
death
her
steps
take
hold
on
hell
lest
thou
shouldest
ponder
the
path
of
life
her
ways
are
moveable
that
thou
canst
not
know
them
hear
me
now
therefore
o
ye
children
and
depart
not
from
the
words
of
my
mouth
remove
thy
way
far
from
her
and
come
not
nigh
the
door
of
her
house
lest
thou
give
thine
honour
unto
others
and
thy
years
unto
the
cruel
lest
strangers
be
filled
with
thy
wealth
and
thy
labours
be
in
the
house
of
a
stranger
and
thou
mourn
at
the
last
when
thy
flesh
and
thy
body
are
consumed
and
say
how
have
i
hated
instruction
and
my
heart
despised
reproof
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
my
teachers
nor
inclined
mine
ear
to
them
that
instructed
me
i
was
almost
in
all
evil
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
assembly
drink
waters
out
of
thine
own
cistern
and
running
waters
out
of
thine
own
well
let
thy
fountains
be
dispersed
abroad
and
rivers
of
waters
in
the
streets
let
them
be
only
thine
own
and
not
strangers
with
thee
let
thy
fountain
be
blessed
and
rejoice
with
the
wife
of
thy
youth
let
her
be
as
the
loving
hind
and
pleasant
roe
let
her
breasts
satisfy
thee
at
all
times
and
be
thou
ravished
always
with
her
love
and
why
wilt
thou
my
son
be
ravished
with
a
strange
woman
and
embrace
the
bosom
of
a
stranger
for
the
ways
of
man
are
before
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
he
pondereth
all
his
goings
his
own
iniquities
shall
take
the
wicked
himself
and
he
shall
be
holden
with
the
cords
of
his
sins
he
shall
die
without
instruction
and
in
the
greatness
of
his
folly
he
shall
go
astray
my
son
if
thou
be
surety
for
thy
friend
if
thou
hast
stricken
thy
hand
with
a
stranger
thou
art
snared
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth
thou
art
taken
with
the
words
of
thy
mouth
do
this
now
my
son
and
deliver
thyself
when
thou
art
come
into
the
hand
of
thy
friend
go
humble
thyself
and
make
sure
thy
friend
give
not
sleep
to
thine
eyes
nor
slumber
to
thine
eyelids
deliver
thyself
as
a
roe
from
the
hand
of
the
hunter
and
as
a
bird
from
the
hand
of
the
fowler
go
to
the
ant
thou
sluggard
consider
her
ways
and
be
wise
which
having
no
guide
overseer
or
ruler
provideth
her
meat
in
the
summer
and
gathereth
her
food
in
the
harvest
how
long
wilt
thou
sleep
o
sluggard
when
wilt
thou
arise
out
of
thy
sleep
yet
a
little
sleep
a
little
slumber
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep
so
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man
a
naughty
person
a
wicked
man
walketh
with
a
froward
mouth
he
winketh
with
his
eyes
he
speaketh
with
his
feet
he
teacheth
with
his
fingers
frowardness
is
in
his
heart
he
deviseth
mischief
continually
he
soweth
discord
therefore
shall
his
calamity
come
suddenly
suddenly
shall
he
be
broken
without
remedy
these
six
things
doth
the
lord
hate
yea
seven
are
an
abomination
unto
him
a
proud
look
a
lying
tongue
and
hands
that
shed
innocent
blood
an
heart
that
deviseth
wicked
imaginations
feet
that
be
swift
in
running
to
mischief
a
false
witness
that
speaketh
lies
and
he
that
soweth
discord
among
brethren
my
son
keep
thy
father's
commandment
and
forsake
not
the
law
of
thy
mother
bind
them
continually
upon
thine
heart
and
tie
them
about
thy
neck
when
thou
goest
it
shall
lead
thee
when
thou
sleepest
it
shall
keep
thee
and
when
thou
awakest
it
shall
talk
with
thee
for
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
and
the
law
is
light
and
reproofs
of
instruction
are
the
way
of
life
to
keep
thee
from
the
evil
woman
from
the
flattery
of
the
tongue
of
a
strange
woman
lust
not
after
her
beauty
in
thine
heart
neither
let
her
take
thee
with
her
eyelids
for
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece
of
bread
and
the
adultress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
life
can
a
man
take
fire
in
his
bosom
and
his
clothes
not
be
burned
can
one
go
upon
hot
coals
and
his
feet
not
be
burned
so
he
that
goeth
in
to
his
neighbour's
wife
whosoever
toucheth
her
shall
not
be
innocent
men
do
not
despise
a
thief
if
he
steal
to
satisfy
his
soul
when
he
is
hungry
but
if
he
be
found
he
shall
restore
sevenfold
he
shall
give
all
the
substance
of
his
house
but
whoso
committeth
adultery
with
a
woman
lacketh
understanding
he
that
doeth
it
destroyeth
his
own
soul
a
wound
and
dishonour
shall
he
get
and
his
reproach
shall
not
be
wiped
away
for
jealousy
is
the
rage
of
a
man
therefore
he
will
not
spare
in
the
day
of
vengeance
he
will
not
regard
any
ransom
neither
will
he
rest
content
though
thou
givest
many
gifts
my
son
keep
my
words
and
lay
up
my
commandments
with
thee
keep
my
commandments
and
live
and
my
law
as
the
apple
of
thine
eye
bind
them
upon
thy
fingers
write
them
upon
the
table
of
thine
heart
say
unto
wisdom
thou
art
my
sister
and
call
understanding
thy
kinswoman
that
they
may
keep
thee
from
the
strange
woman
from
the
stranger
which
flattereth
with
her
words
for
at
the
window
of
my
house
i
looked
through
my
casement
and
beheld
among
the
simple
ones
i
discerned
among
the
youths
a
young
man
void
of
understanding
passing
through
the
street
near
her
corner
and
he
went
the
way
to
her
house
in
the
twilight
in
the
evening
in
the
black
and
dark
night
and
behold
there
met
him
a
woman
with
the
attire
of
an
harlot
and
subtil
of
heart
she
is
loud
and
stubborn
her
feet
abide
not
in
her
house
now
is
she
without
now
in
the
streets
and
lieth
in
wait
at
every
corner
so
she
caught
him
and
kissed
him
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
him
i
have
peace
offerings
with
me
this
day
have
i
payed
my
vows
therefore
came
i
forth
to
meet
thee
diligently
to
seek
thy
face
and
i
have
found
thee
i
have
decked
my
bed
with
coverings
of
tapestry
with
carved
works
with
fine
linen
of
egypt
i
have
perfumed
my
bed
with
myrrh
aloes
and
cinnamon
come
let
us
take
our
fill
of
love
until
the
morning
let
us
solace
ourselves
with
loves
for
the
goodman
is
not
at
home
he
is
gone
a
long
journey
he
hath
taken
a
bag
of
money
with
him
and
will
come
home
at
the
day
appointed
with
her
much
fair
speech
she
caused
him
to
yield
with
the
flattering
of
her
lips
she
forced
him
he
goeth
after
her
straightway
as
an
ox
goeth
to
the
slaughter
or
as
a
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
stocks
till
a
dart
strike
through
his
liver
as
a
bird
hasteth
to
the
snare
and
knoweth
not
that
it
is
for
his
life
hearken
unto
me
now
therefore
o
ye
children
and
attend
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
let
not
thine
heart
decline
to
her
ways
go
not
astray
in
her
paths
for
she
hath
cast
down
many
wounded
yea
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
her
her
house
is
the
way
to
hell
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
death
doth
not
wisdom
cry
and
understanding
put
forth
her
voice
she
standeth
in
the
top
of
high
places
by
the
way
in
the
places
of
the
paths
she
crieth
at
the
gates
at
the
entry
of
the
city
at
the
coming
in
at
the
doors
unto
you
o
men
i
call
and
my
voice
is
to
the
sons
of
man
o

and
ye
fools
be
ye
of
an
understanding
heart

for
i
will
speak
of
excellent
things
and
the
opening
of
my
lips
shall
be
right
things
for
my
mouth
shall
speak
truth
and
wickedness
is
an
abomination
to
my
lips
all
the
words
of
my
mouth
are
in
righteousness
there
is
nothing
froward
or
perverse
in
them
they
are
all
plain
to
him
that
understandeth
and
right
to
them
that
find
knowledge
receive
my
instruction
and
not
silver
and
knowledge
rather
than
choice
gold
for
wisdom
is
better
than
rubies
and
all
the
things
that
may
be
desired
are
not
to
be
compared
to
it
i
wisdom
dwell
with
prudence
and
find
out
knowledge
of
witty
inventions
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
to
hate
evil
pride
and
arrogancy
and
the
evil
way
and
the
froward
mouth
do
i
hate
counsel
is
mine
and
sound
wisdom
i
am
understanding
i
have
strength
by
me
kings

and
princes
decree
justice
by
me
princes
rule
and
nobles
even
all
the
judges
of
the
earth
i
love
them
that
love
me
and
those
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
riches
and
honour
are
with
me
yea
durable
riches
and
righteousness
my
fruit
is
better
than
gold
yea
than
fine
gold
and
my
revenue
than
choice
silver
i
lead
in
the
way
of
righteousness
in
the
midst
of
the
paths
of
judgment
that
i
may
cause
those
that
love
me
to
inherit
substance
and
i
will
fill
their
treasures
the
lord
possessed
me
in
the
beginning
of
his
way
before
his
works
of
old
i
was
set
up
from
everlasting
from
the
beginning
or
ever
the
earth
was
when
there
were
no
depths
i
was
brought
forth
when
there
were
no
fountains
abounding
with
water
before
the
mountains
were
settled
before
the
hills
was
i
brought
forth
while
as
yet
he
had
not
made
the
earth
nor
the
fields
nor
the
highest
part
of
the
dust
of
the
world
when
he
prepared
the
heavens
i
was
there
when
he
set
a
compass
upon
the
face
of
the
depth
when
he
established
the
clouds
above
when
he
strengthened
the
fountains
of
the
deep
when
he
gave
to
the
sea
his
decree
that
the
waters
should
not
pass
his
commandment
when
he
appointed
the
foundations
of
the
earth
then
i
was
by
him
as
one
brought
up
with
him
and
i
was
daily
his
delight
rejoicing
always
before
him
rejoicing
in
the
habitable
part
of
his
earth
and
my
delights
were
with
the
sons
of
men
now
therefore
hearken
unto
me
o
ye
children
for
blessed
are
they
that
keep
my
ways
hear
instruction
and
be
wise
and
refuse
it
not
blessed
is
the
man
that
heareth
me
watching
daily
at
my
gates
waiting
at
the
posts
of
my
doors
for
whoso
findeth
me
findeth
life
and
shall
obtain
favour
of
the
lord
but
he
that
sinneth
against
me
wrongeth
his
own
soul
all
they
that
hate
me

sent
forth
her

she
crieth
upon
the
highest
places
of

whoso
is

let
him
turn
in
hither
as
for
him
that
wanteth
understanding
she
saith
to
him
come
eat
of
my
bread
and
drink
of
the
wine
which
i
have
mingled
forsake
the
foolish
and
live
and
go
in
the
way
of
understanding

that
reproveth
a
scorner
getteth
to
himself
shame
and
he
that
rebuketh
a
wicked
man
getteth
himself
a
blot
reprove
not
a
scorner
lest
he
hate
thee
rebuke
a
wise
man
and
he
will
love
thee
give
instruction
to
a
wise
man
and
he
will
be
yet
wiser
teach
a
just
man
and
he
will
increase
in
learning
the
fear
of
the

is
the

of
wisdom
and
the
knowledge
of
the
holy

thy
days
shall
be
multiplied
and
the
years
of
thy
life
shall
be
increased
if
thou
be
wise
thou
shalt
be
wise
for
thyself
but
if
thou
scornest
thou
alone
shalt
bear
it
a
foolish
woman
is
clamorous
she
is
simple
and
knoweth
nothing
for
she
sitteth
at
the
door
of
her
house
on
a
seat
in
the
high
places
of
the
city
to
call
passengers
who
go
right
on

whoso
is

let
him
turn
in
hither
and
as
for
him
that
wanteth
understanding
she
saith
to
him
stolen
waters
are
sweet
and
bread
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant
but
he
knoweth
not
that
the

are
there

in
the

the
proverbs

a
foolish
son

the
heaviness
of
his

treasures
of
wickedness
profit
nothing
but
righteousness
delivereth
from

the
lord
will
not
suffer
the
soul
of
the

but
he
casteth
away
the
substance
of
the
wicked

but
the

walketh

but
a

for
the

of
him
that

void
of

wise
men
lay
up
knowledge
but
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
near
destruction
the
rich
man's
wealth

the
destruction
of

their
poverty
the

the
fruit
of

he

he
that
refraineth
his
lips
is
wise
the
tongue
of
the
just
is
as
choice
silver
the
heart
of
the
wicked
is
little
worth
the

of
the

feed
many
but
fools
die
for
want
of
wisdom
the
blessing
of
the

it
maketh
rich
and
he
addeth
no
sorrow
with
it
it
is
as
sport
to
a
fool
to
do
mischief
but
a
man
of
understanding
hath
wisdom
the
fear
of
the
wicked
it
shall
come
upon
him
but
the
desire
of
the
righteous
shall
be
granted
as
the
whirlwind
passeth
so
is
the
wicked
no
more
but
the
righteous
is
an
everlasting
foundation
as
vinegar
to
the
teeth
and
as
smoke
to
the
eyes
so
is
the
sluggard
to
them
that
send
him
the
fear
of
the
lord
prolongeth
days
but
the
years
of
the
wicked
shall
be
shortened
the
hope
of
the
righteous
shall
be
gladness
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
shall
perish
the
way
of
the
lord
is
strength
to
the
upright
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
the
righteous
shall
never
be
removed
but
the
wicked
shall
not
inhabit
the
earth
the
mouth
of
the
just
bringeth
forth
wisdom
but
the
froward
tongue
shall
be
cut
out
the
lips
of
the
righteous
know
what
is
acceptable
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
speaketh
frowardness
a
false
balance
is
abomination
to
the
lord
but
a
just
weight
is
his
delight
when
pride
cometh
then
cometh
shame
but
with
the
lowly
is
wisdom
the
integrity
of
the
upright
shall
guide
them
but
the
perverseness
of
transgressors
shall
destroy
them
riches
profit
not
in
the
day
of
wrath
but
righteousness
delivereth
from
death
the
righteousness
of
the
perfect
shall
direct
his
way
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
by
his
own
wickedness
the
righteousness
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them
but
transgressors
shall
be
taken
in
their
own
naughtiness
when
a
wicked
man
dieth
his
expectation
shall
perish
and
the
hope
of
unjust
men
perisheth
the
righteous
is
delivered
out
of
trouble
and
the
wicked
cometh
in
his
stead
an
hypocrite
with
his
mouth
destroyeth
his
neighbour
but
through
knowledge
shall
the
just
be
delivered
when
it
goeth
well
with
the
righteous
the
city
rejoiceth
and
when
the
wicked
perish
there
is
shouting
by
the
blessing
of
the
upright
the
city
is
exalted
but
it
is
overthrown
by
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
he
that
is
void
of
wisdom
despiseth
his
neighbour
but
a
man
of
understanding
holdeth
his
peace
a
talebearer
revealeth
secrets
but
he
that
is
of
a
faithful
spirit
concealeth
the
matter
where
no
counsel
is
the
people
fall
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety
he
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
shall
smart
for
it
and
he
that
hateth
suretiship
is
sure
a
gracious
woman
retaineth
honour
and
strong
men
retain
riches
the
merciful
man
doeth
good
to
his
own
soul
but
he
that
is
cruel
troubleth
his
own
flesh
the
wicked
worketh
a
deceitful
work
but
to
him
that
soweth
righteousness
shall
be
a
sure
reward
as
righteousness
tendeth
to
life
so
he
that
pursueth
evil
pursueth
it
to
his
own
death
they
that
are
of
a
froward
heart
are
abomination
to
the
lord
but
such
as
are
upright
in
their
way
are
his
delight
though
hand
join
in
hand
the
wicked
shall
not
be
unpunished
but
the
seed
of
the
righteous
shall
be
delivered
as
a
jewel
of
gold
in
a
swine's
snout
so
is
a
fair
woman
which
is
without
discretion
the
desire
of
the
righteous
is
only
good
but
the
expectation
of
the
wicked
is
wrath
there
is
that
scattereth
and
yet
increaseth
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than
is
meet
but
it
tendeth
to
poverty
the
liberal
soul
shall
be
made
fat
and
he
that
watereth
shall
be
watered
also
himself
he
that
withholdeth
corn
the
people
shall
curse
him
but
blessing
shall
be
upon
the
head
of
him
that
selleth
it
he
that
diligently
seeketh
good
procureth
favour
but
he
that
seeketh
mischief
it
shall
come
unto
him
he
that
trusteth
in
his
riches
shall
fall
but
the
righteous
shall
flourish
as
a
branch
he
that
troubleth
his
own
house
shall
inherit
the
wind
and
the
fool
shall
be
servant
to
the
wise
of
heart
the
fruit
of
the
righteous
is
a
tree
of
life
and
he
that
winneth
souls
is
wise
behold
the
righteous
shall
be
recompensed
in
the
earth
much
more
the
wicked
and
the
sinner
whoso
loveth
instruction
loveth
knowledge
but
he
that
hateth
reproof
is
brutish
a
good
man
obtaineth
favour
of
the
lord
but
a
man
of
wicked
devices
will
he
condemn
a
man
shall
not
be
established
by
wickedness
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
shall
not
be
moved
a
virtuous
woman
is
a
crown
to
her
husband
but
she
that
maketh
ashamed
is
as
rottenness
in
his
bones
the
thoughts
of
the
righteous
are
right
but
the
counsels
of
the
wicked
are
deceit
the
words
of
the
wicked
are
to
lie
in
wait
for
blood
but
the
mouth
of
the
upright
shall
deliver
them
the
wicked
are
overthrown
and
are
not
but
the
house
of
the
righteous
shall
stand
a
man
shall
be
commended
according
to
his
wisdom
but
he
that
is
of
a
perverse
heart
shall
be
despised
he
that
is
despised
and
hath
a
servant
is
better
than
he
that
honoureth
himself
and
lacketh
bread
a
righteous
man
regardeth
the
life
of
his
beast
but
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wicked
are
cruel
he
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
be
satisfied
with
bread
but
he
that
followeth
vain
persons
is
void
of
understanding
the
wicked
desireth
the
net
of
evil
men
but
the
root
of
the
righteous
yieldeth
fruit
the
wicked
is
snared
by
the
transgression
of
his
lips
but
the
just
shall
come
out
of
trouble
a
man
shall
be
satisfied
with
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
and
the
recompence
of
a
man's
hands
shall
be
rendered
unto
him
the
way
of
a
fool
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
but
he
that
hearkeneth
unto
counsel
is
wise
a
fool's
wrath
is
presently
known
but
a
prudent
man
covereth
shame
he
that
speaketh
truth
sheweth
forth
righteousness
but
a
false
witness
deceit
there
is
that
speaketh
like
the
piercings
of
a
sword
but
the
tongue
of
the
wise
is
health
the
lip
of
truth
shall
be
established
for
ever
but
a
lying
tongue
is
but
for
a
moment
deceit
is
in
the
heart
of
them
that
imagine
evil
but
to
the
counsellors
of
peace
is
joy
there
shall
no
evil
happen
to
the
just
but
the
wicked
shall
be
filled
with
mischief
lying
lips
are
abomination
to
the
lord
but
they
that
deal
truly
are
his
delight
a
prudent
man
concealeth
knowledge
but
the
heart
of
fools
proclaimeth
foolishness
the
hand
of
the
diligent
shall
bear
rule
but
the
slothful
shall
be
under
tribute
heaviness
in
the
heart
of
man
maketh
it
stoop
but
a
good
word
maketh
it
glad
the
righteous
is
more
excellent
than
his
neighbour
but
the
way
of
the
wicked
seduceth
them
the
slothful
man
roasteth
not
that
which
he
took
in
hunting
but
the
substance
of
a
diligent
man
is
precious
in
the
way
of
righteousness
is
life
and
in
the
pathway
thereof
there
is
no
death
a
wise
son
heareth
his
father's
instruction
but
a
scorner
heareth
not
rebuke
a
man
shall
eat
good
by
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
but
the
soul
of
the
transgressors
shall
eat
violence
he
that
keepeth
his
mouth
keepeth
his
life
but
he
that
openeth
wide
his
lips
shall
have
destruction
the
soul
of
the
sluggard
desireth
and
hath
nothing
but
the
soul
of
the
diligent
shall
be
made
fat
a
righteous
man
hateth
lying
but
a
wicked
man
is
loathsome
and
cometh
to
shame
righteousness
keepeth
him
that
is
upright
in
the
way
but
wickedness
overthroweth
the
sinner
there
is
that
maketh
himself
rich
yet
hath
nothing
there
is
that
maketh
himself
poor
yet
hath
great
riches
the
ransom
of
a
man's
life
are
his
riches
but
the
poor
heareth
not
rebuke
the
light
of
the
righteous
rejoiceth
but
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
only
by
pride
cometh
contention
but
with
the
well
advised
is
wisdom
wealth
gotten
by
vanity
shall
be
diminished
but
he
that
gathereth
by
labour
shall
increase
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
but
when
the
desire
cometh
it
is
a
tree
of
life
whoso
despiseth
the
word
shall
be
destroyed
but
he
that
feareth
the
commandment
shall
be
rewarded
the
law
of
the
wise
is
a
fountain
of
life
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death
good
understanding
giveth
favour
but
the
way
of
transgressors
is
hard
every
prudent
man
dealeth
with
knowledge
but
a
fool
layeth
open
his
folly
a
wicked
messenger
falleth
into
mischief
but
a
faithful
ambassador
is
health
poverty
and
shame
shall
be
to
him
that
refuseth
instruction
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
shall
be
honoured
the
desire
accomplished
is
sweet
to
the
soul
but
it
is
abomination
to
fools
to
depart
from
evil
he
that
walketh
with
wise
men
shall
be
wise
but
a
companion
of
fools
shall
be
destroyed
evil
pursueth
sinners
but
to
the
righteous
good
shall
be
repayed
a
good
man
leaveth
an
inheritance
to
his
children's
children
and
the
wealth
of
the
sinner
is
laid
up
for
the
just
much
food
is
in
the
tillage
of
the
poor
but
there
is
that
is
destroyed
for
want
of
judgment
he
that
spareth
his
rod
hateth
his
son
but
he
that
loveth
him
chasteneth
him
betimes
the
righteous
eateth
to
the
satisfying
of
his
soul
but
the
belly
of
the
wicked
shall
want
every
wise
woman
buildeth
her
house
but
the
foolish
plucketh
it
down
with
her
hands
he
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness
feareth
the
lord
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
despiseth
him
in
the
mouth
of
the
foolish
is
a
rod
of
pride
but
the
lips
of
the
wise
shall
preserve
them
where
no
oxen
are
the
crib
is
clean
but
much
increase
is
by
the
strength
of
the
ox
a
faithful
witness
will
not
lie
but
a
false
witness
will
utter
lies
a
scorner
seeketh
wisdom
and
findeth
it
not
but
knowledge
is
easy
unto
him
that
understandeth
go
from
the
presence
of
a
foolish
man
when
thou
perceivest
not
in
him
the
lips
of
knowledge
the
wisdom
of
the
prudent
is
to
understand
his
way
but
the
folly
of
fools
is
deceit
fools
make
a
mock
at
sin
but
among
the
righteous
there
is
favour
the
heart
knoweth
his
own
bitterness
and
a
stranger
doth
not
intermeddle
with
his
joy
the
house
of
the
wicked
shall
be
overthrown
but
the
tabernacle
of
the
upright
shall
flourish
there
is
a
way
which
seemeth
right
unto
a
man
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death
even
in
laughter
the
heart
is
sorrowful
and
the
end
of
that
mirth
is
heaviness
the
backslider
in
heart
shall
be
filled
with
his
own
ways
and
a
good
man
shall
be
satisfied
from
himself
the
simple
believeth
every
word
but
the
prudent
man
looketh
well
to
his
going
a
wise
man
feareth
and
departeth
from
evil
but
the
fool
rageth
and
is
confident
he
that
is
soon
angry
dealeth
foolishly
and
a
man
of
wicked
devices
is
hated
the
simple
inherit
folly
but
the
prudent
are
crowned
with
knowledge
the
evil
bow
before
the
good
and
the
wicked
at
the
gates
of
the
righteous
the
poor
is
hated
even
of
his
own
neighbour
but
the
rich
hath
many
friends
he
that
despiseth
his
neighbour
sinneth
but
he
that
hath
mercy
on
the
poor
happy
is
he
do
they
not
err
that
devise
evil
but
mercy
and
truth
shall
be
to
them
that
devise
good
in
all
labour
there
is
profit
but
the
talk
of
the
lips
tendeth
only
to
penury
the
crown
of
the
wise
is
their
riches
but
the
foolishness
of
fools
is
folly
a
true
witness
delivereth
souls
but
a
deceitful
witness
speaketh
lies
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
strong
confidence
and
his
children
shall
have
a
place
of
refuge
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
a
fountain
of
life
to
depart
from
the
snares
of
death
in
the
multitude
of
people
is
the
king's
honour
but
in
the
want
of
people
is
the
destruction
of
the
prince
he
that
is
slow
to
wrath
is
of
great
understanding
but
he
that
is
hasty
of
spirit
exalteth
folly
a
sound
heart
is
the
life
of
the
flesh
but
envy
the
rottenness
of
the
bones
he
that
oppresseth
the
poor
reproacheth
his
maker
but
he
that
honoureth
him
hath
mercy
on
the
poor
the
wicked
is
driven
away
in
his
wickedness
but
the
righteous
hath
hope
in
his
death
wisdom
resteth
in
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
but
that
which
is
in
the
midst
of
fools
is
made
known
righteousness
exalteth
a
nation
but
sin
is
a
reproach
to
any
people
the
king's
favour
is
toward
a
wise
servant
but
his
wrath
is
against
him
that
causeth
shame
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
but
grievous
words
stir
up
anger
the
tongue
of
the
wise
useth
knowledge
aright
but
the
mouth
of
fools
poureth
out
foolishness
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
in
every
place
beholding
the
evil
and
the
good
a
wholesome
tongue
is
a
tree
of
life
but
perverseness
therein
is
a
breach
in
the
spirit
a
fool
despiseth
his
father's
instruction
but
he
that
regardeth
reproof
is
prudent
in
the
house
of
the
righteous
is
much
treasure
but
in
the
revenues
of
the
wicked
is
trouble
the
lips
of
the
wise
disperse
knowledge
but
the
heart
of
the
foolish
doeth
not
so
the
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
but
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
his
delight
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
but
he
loveth
him
that
followeth
after
righteousness
correction
is
grievous
unto
him
that
forsaketh
the
way
and
he
that
hateth
reproof
shall
die
hell
and
destruction
are
before
the
lord
how
much
more
then
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
a
scorner
loveth
not
one
that
reproveth
him
neither
will
he
go
unto
the
wise
a
merry
heart
maketh
a
cheerful
countenance
but
by
sorrow
of
the
heart
the
spirit
is
broken
the
heart
of
him
that
hath
understanding
seeketh
knowledge
but
the
mouth
of
fools
feedeth
on
foolishness
all
the
days
of
the
afflicted
are
evil
but
he
that
is
of
a
merry
heart
hath
a
continual
feast
better
is
little
with
the
fear
of
the
lord
than
great
treasure
and
trouble
therewith
better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
a
wrathful
man
stirreth
up
strife
but
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
appeaseth
strife
the
way
of
the
slothful
man
is
as
an
hedge
of
thorns
but
the
way
of
the
righteous
is
made
plain
a
wise
son
maketh
a
glad
father
but
a
foolish
man
despiseth
his
mother
folly
is
joy
to
him
that
is
destitute
of
wisdom
but
a
man
of
understanding
walketh
uprightly
without
counsel
purposes
are
disappointed
but
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
they
are
established
a
man
hath
joy
by
the
answer
of
his
mouth
and
a
word
spoken
in
due
season
how
good
is
it
the
way
of
life
is
above
to
the
wise
that
he
may
depart
from
hell
beneath
the
lord
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
proud
but
he
will
establish
the
border
of
the
widow
the
thoughts
of
the
wicked
are
an
abomination
to
the
lord
but
the
words
of
the
pure
are
pleasant
words
he
that
is
greedy
of
gain
troubleth
his
own
house
but
he
that
hateth
gifts
shall
live
the
heart
of
the
righteous
studieth
to
answer
but
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
poureth
out
evil
things
the
lord
is
far
from
the
wicked
but
he
heareth
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
the
light
of
the
eyes
rejoiceth
the
heart
and
a
good
report
maketh
the
bones
fat
the
ear
that
heareth
the
reproof
of
life
abideth
among
the
wise
he
that
refuseth
instruction
despiseth
his
own
soul
but
he
that
heareth
reproof
getteth
understanding
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
instruction
of
wisdom
and
before
honour
is
humility
the
preparations
of
the
heart
in
man
and
the
answer
of
the
tongue
is
from
the
lord
all
the
ways
of
a
man
are
clean
in
his
own
eyes
but
the
lord
weigheth
the
spirits
commit
thy
works
unto
the
lord
and
thy
thoughts
shall
be
established
the
lord
hath
made
all
things
for
himself
yea
even
the
wicked
for
the
day
of
evil
every
one
that
is
proud
in
heart
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
though
hand
join
in
hand
he
shall
not
be
unpunished
by
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is
purged
and
by
the
fear
of
the
lord
men
depart
from
evil
when
a
man's
ways
please
the
lord
he
maketh
even
his
enemies
to
be
at
peace
with
him
better
is
a
little
with
righteousness
than
great
revenues
without
right
a
man's
heart
deviseth
his
way
but
the
lord
directeth
his
steps
a
divine
sentence
is
in
the
lips
of
the
king
his
mouth
transgresseth
not
in
judgment
a
just
weight
and
balance
are
the
lord's
all
the
weights
of
the
bag
are
his
work
it
is
an
abomination
to
kings
to
commit
wickedness
for
the
throne
is
established
by
righteousness
righteous
lips
are
the
delight
of
kings
and
they
love
him
that
speaketh
right
the
wrath
of
a
king
is
as
messengers
of
death
but
a
wise
man
will
pacify
it
in
the
light
of
the
king's
countenance
is
life
and
his
favour
is
as
a
cloud
of
the
latter
rain
how
much
better
is
it
to
get
wisdom
than
gold
and
to
get
understanding
rather
to
be
chosen
than
silver
the
highway
of
the
upright
is
to
depart
from
evil
he
that
keepeth
his
way
preserveth
his
soul
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
an
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
better
it
is
to
be
of
an
humble
spirit
with
the
lowly
than
to
divide
the
spoil
with
the
proud
he
that
handleth
a
matter
wisely
shall
find
good
and
whoso
trusteth
in
the
lord
happy
is
he
the
wise
in
heart
shall
be
called
prudent
and
the
sweetness
of
the
lips
increaseth
learning
understanding
is
a
wellspring
of
life
unto
him
that
hath
it
but
the
instruction
of
fools
is
folly
the
heart
of
the
wise
teacheth
his
mouth
and
addeth
learning
to
his
lips
pleasant
words
are
as
an
honeycomb
sweet
to
the
soul
and
health
to
the
bones
there
is
a
way
that
seemeth
right
unto
a
man
but
the
end
thereof
are
the
ways
of
death
he
that
laboureth
laboureth
for
himself
for
his
mouth
craveth
it
of
him
an
ungodly
man
diggeth
up
evil
and
in
his
lips
there
is
as
a
burning
fire
a
froward
man
soweth
strife
and
a
whisperer
separateth
chief
friends
a
violent
man
enticeth
his
neighbour
and
leadeth
him
into
the
way
that
is
not
good
he
shutteth
his
eyes
to
devise
froward
things
moving
his
lips
he
bringeth
evil
to
pass
the
hoary
head
is
a
crown
of
glory
if
it
be
found
in
the
way
of
righteousness
he
that
is
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
the
mighty
and
he
that
ruleth
his
spirit
than
he
that
taketh
a
city
the
lot
is
cast
into
the
lap
but
the
whole
disposing
thereof
is
of
the
lord
better
is
a
dry
morsel
and
quietness
therewith
than
an
house
full
of
sacrifices
with
strife
a
wise
servant
shall
have
rule
over
a
son
that
causeth
shame
and
shall
have
part
of
the
inheritance
among
the
brethren
the
fining
pot
is
for
silver
and
the
furnace
for
gold
but
the
lord
trieth
the
hearts
a
wicked
doer
giveth
heed
to
false
lips
and
a
liar
giveth
ear
to
a
naughty
tongue
whoso
mocketh
the
poor
reproacheth
his
maker
and
he
that
is
glad
at
calamities
shall
not
be
unpunished
children's
children
are
the
crown
of
old
men
and
the
glory
of
children
are
their
fathers
excellent
speech
becometh
not
a
fool
much
less
do
lying
lips
a
prince
a
gift
is
as
a
precious
stone
in
the
eyes
of
him
that
hath
it
whithersoever
it
turneth
it
prospereth
he
that
covereth
a
transgression
seeketh
love
but
he
that
repeateth
a
matter
separateth
very
friends
a
reproof
entereth
more
into
a
wise
man
than
an
hundred
stripes
into
a
fool
an
evil
man
seeketh
only
rebellion
therefore
a
cruel
messenger
shall
be
sent
against
him
let
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
meet
a
man
rather
than
a
fool
in
his
folly
whoso
rewardeth
evil
for
good
evil
shall
not
depart
from
his
house
the
beginning
of
strife
is
as
when
one
letteth
out
water
therefore
leave
off
contention
before
it
be
meddled
with
he
that
justifieth
the
wicked
and
he
that
condemneth
the
just
even
they
both
are
abomination
to
the
lord
wherefore
is
there
a
price
in
the
hand
of
a
fool
to
get
wisdom
seeing
he
hath
no
heart
to
it
a
friend
loveth
at
all
times
and
a
brother
is
born
for
adversity
a
man
void
of
understanding
striketh
hands
and
becometh
surety
in
the
presence
of
his
friend
he
loveth
transgression
that
loveth
strife
and
he
that
exalteth
his
gate
seeketh
destruction
he
that
hath
a
froward
heart
findeth
no
good
and
he
that
hath
a
perverse
tongue
falleth
into
mischief
he
that
begetteth
a
fool
doeth
it
to
his
sorrow
and
the
father
of
a
fool
hath
no
joy
a
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
but
a
broken
spirit
drieth
the
bones
a
wicked
man
taketh
a
gift
out
of
the
bosom
to
pervert
the
ways
of
judgment
wisdom
is
before
him
that
hath
understanding
but
the
eyes
of
a
fool
are
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
a
foolish
son
is
a
grief
to
his
father
and
bitterness
to
her
that
bare
him
also
to
punish
the
just
is
not
good
nor
to
strike
princes
for
equity
he
that
hath
knowledge
spareth
his
words
and
a
man
of
understanding
is
of
an
excellent
spirit
even
a
fool
when
he
holdeth
his
peace
is
counted
wise
and
he
that
shutteth
his
lips
is
esteemed
a
man
of
understanding
through
desire
a
man
having
separated
himself
seeketh
and
intermeddleth
with
all
wisdom
a
fool
hath
no
delight
in
understanding
but
that
his
heart
may
discover
itself
when
the
wicked
cometh
then
cometh
also
contempt
and
with
ignominy
reproach
the
words
of
a
man's
mouth
are
as
deep
waters
and
the
wellspring
of
wisdom
as
a
flowing
brook
it
is
not
good
to
accept
the
person
of
the
wicked
to
overthrow
the
righteous
in
judgment
a
fool's
lips
enter
into
contention
and
his
mouth
calleth
for
strokes
a
fool's
mouth
is
his
destruction
and
his
lips
are
the
snare
of
his
soul
the
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly
he
also
that
is
slothful
in
his
work
is
brother
to
him
that
is
a
great
waster
the
name
of
the
lord
is
a
strong
tower
the
righteous
runneth
into
it
and
is
safe
the
rich
man's
wealth
is
his
strong
city
and
as
an
high
wall
in
his
own
conceit
before
destruction
the
heart
of
man
is
haughty
and
before
honour
is
humility
he
that
answereth
a
matter
before
he
heareth
it
it
is
folly
and
shame
unto
him
the
spirit
of
a
man
will
sustain
his
infirmity
but
a
wounded
spirit
who
can
bear
the
heart
of
the
prudent
getteth
knowledge
and
the
ear
of
the
wise
seeketh
knowledge
a
man's
gift
maketh
room
for
him
and
bringeth
him
before
great
men
he
that
is
first
in
his
own
cause
seemeth
just
but
his
neighbour
cometh
and
searcheth
him
the
lot
causeth
contentions
to
cease
and
parteth
between
the
mighty
a
brother
offended
is
harder
to
be
won
than
a
strong
city
and
their
contentions
are
like
the
bars
of
a
castle
a
man's
belly
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
fruit
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
increase
of
his
lips
shall
he
be
filled
death
and
life
are
in
the
power
of
the
tongue
and
they
that
love
it
shall
eat
the
fruit
thereof
whoso
findeth
a
wife
findeth
a
good
thing
and
obtaineth
favour
of
the
lord
the
poor
useth
intreaties
but
the
rich
answereth
roughly
a
man
that
hath
friends
must
shew
himself
friendly
and
there
is
a
friend
that
sticketh
closer
than
a
brother
better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
integrity
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
lips
and
is
a
fool
also
that
the
soul
be
without
knowledge
it
is
not
good
and
he
that
hasteth
with
his
feet
sinneth
the
foolishness
of
man
perverteth
his
way
and
his
heart
fretteth
against
the
lord
wealth
maketh
many
friends
but
the
poor
is
separated
from
his
neighbour
a
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
not
escape
many
will
intreat
the
favour
of
the
prince
and
every
man
is
a
friend
to
him
that
giveth
gifts
all
the
brethren
of
the
poor
do
hate
him
how
much
more
do
his
friends
go
far
from
him
he
pursueth
them
with
words
yet
they
are
wanting
to
him
he
that
getteth
wisdom
loveth
his
own
soul
he
that
keepeth
understanding
shall
find
good
a
false
witness
shall
not
be
unpunished
and
he
that
speaketh
lies
shall
perish
delight
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool
much
less
for
a
servant
to
have
rule
over
princes
the
discretion
of
a
man
deferreth
his
anger
and
it
is
his
glory
to
pass
over
a
transgression
the
king's
wrath
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion
but
his
favour
is
as
dew
upon
the
grass
a
foolish
son
is
the
calamity
of
his
father
and
the
contentions
of
a
wife
are
a
continual
dropping
house
and
riches
are
the
inheritance
of
fathers
and
a
prudent
wife
is
from
the
lord
slothfulness
casteth
into
a
deep
sleep
and
an
idle
soul
shall
suffer
hunger
he
that
keepeth
the
commandment
keepeth
his
own
soul
but
he
that
despiseth
his
ways
shall
die
he
that
hath
pity
upon
the
poor
lendeth
unto
the
lord
and
that
which
he
hath
given
will
he
pay
him
again
chasten
thy
son
while
there
is
hope
and
let
not
thy
soul
spare
for
his
crying
a
man
of
great
wrath
shall
suffer
punishment
for
if
thou
deliver
him
yet
thou
must
do
it
again
hear
counsel
and
receive
instruction
that
thou
mayest
be
wise
in
thy
latter
end
there
are
many
devices
in
a
man's
heart
nevertheless
the
counsel
of
the
lord
that
shall
stand
the
desire
of
a
man
is
his
kindness
and
a
poor
man
is
better
than
a
liar
the
fear
of
the
lord
tendeth
to
life
and
he
that
hath
it
shall
abide
satisfied
he
shall
not
be
visited
with
evil
a
slothful
man
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
will
not
so
much
as
bring
it
to
his
mouth
again
smite
a
scorner
and
the
simple
will
beware
and
reprove
one
that
hath
understanding
and
he
will
understand
knowledge
he
that
wasteth
his
father
and
chaseth
away
his
mother
is
a
son
that
causeth
shame
and
bringeth
reproach
cease
my
son
to
hear
the
instruction
that
causeth
to
err
from
the
words
of
knowledge
an
ungodly
witness
scorneth
judgment
and
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
devoureth
iniquity
judgments
are
prepared
for
scorners
and
stripes
for
the
back
of
fools
wine
is
a
mocker
strong
drink
is
raging
and
whosoever
is
deceived
thereby
is
not
wise
the
fear
of
a
king
is
as
the
roaring
of
a
lion
whoso
provoketh
him
to
anger
sinneth
against
his
own
soul
it
is
an
honour
for
a
man
to
cease
from
strife
but
every
fool
will
be
meddling
the
sluggard
will
not
plow
by
reason
of
the
cold
therefore
shall
he
beg
in
harvest
and
have
nothing
counsel
in
the
heart
of
man
is
like
deep
water
but
a
man
of
understanding
will
draw
it
out
most
men
will
proclaim
every
one
his
own
goodness
but
a
faithful
man
who
can
find
the
just
man
walketh
in
his
integrity
his
children
are
blessed
after
him
a
king
that
sitteth
in
the
throne
of
judgment
scattereth
away
all
evil
with
his
eyes
who
can
say
i
have
made
my
heart
clean
i
am
pure
from
my
sin
divers
weights
and
divers
measures
both
of
them
are
alike
abomination
to
the
lord
even
a
child
is
known
by
his
doings
whether
his
work
be
pure
and
whether
it
be
right
the
hearing
ear
and
the
seeing
eye
the
lord
hath
made
even
both
of
them
love
not
sleep
lest
thou
come
to
poverty
open
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
be
satisfied
with
bread
it
is
naught
it
is
naught
saith
the
buyer
but
when
he
is
gone
his
way
then
he
boasteth
there
is
gold
and
a
multitude
of
rubies
but
the
lips
of
knowledge
are
a
precious
jewel
take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman
bread
of
deceit
is
sweet
to
a
man
but
afterwards
his
mouth
shall
be
filled
with
gravel
every
purpose
is
established
by
counsel
and
with
good
advice
make
war
he
that
goeth
about
as
a
talebearer
revealeth
secrets
therefore
meddle
not
with
him
that
flattereth
with
his
lips
whoso
curseth
his
father
or
his
mother
his
lamp
shall
be
put
out
in
obscure
darkness
an
inheritance
may
be
gotten
hastily
at
the
beginning
but
the
end
thereof
shall
not
be
blessed
say
not
thou
i
will
recompense
evil
but
wait
on
the
lord
and
he
shall
save
thee
divers
weights
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
a
false
balance
is
not
good
man's
goings
are
of
the
lord
how
can
a
man
then
understand
his
own
way
it
is
a
snare
to
the
man
who
devoureth
that
which
is
holy
and
after
vows
to
make
enquiry
a
wise
king
scattereth
the
wicked
and
bringeth
the
wheel
over
them
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
candle
of
the
lord
searching
all
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly
mercy
and
truth
preserve
the
king
and
his
throne
is
upholden
by
mercy
the
glory
of
young
men
is
their
strength
and
the
beauty
of
old
men
is
the
grey
head
the
blueness
of
a
wound
cleanseth
away
evil
so
do
stripes
the
inward
parts
of
the
belly
the
king's
heart
is
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
as
the
rivers
of
water
he
turneth
it
whithersoever
he
will
every
way
of
a
man
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
but
the
lord
pondereth
the
hearts
to
do
justice
and
judgment
is
more
acceptable
to
the
lord
than
sacrifice
an
high
look
and
a
proud
heart
and
the
plowing
of
the
wicked
is
sin
the
thoughts
of
the
diligent
tend
only
to
plenteousness
but
of
every
one
that
is
hasty
only
to
want
the
getting
of
treasures
by
a
lying
tongue
is
a
vanity
tossed
to
and
fro
of
them
that
seek
death
the
robbery
of
the
wicked
shall
destroy
them
because
they
refuse
to
do
judgment
the
way
of
man
is
froward
and
strange
but
as
for
the
pure
his
work
is
right
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
a
corner
of
the
housetop
than
with
a
brawling
woman
in
a
wide
house
the
soul
of
the
wicked
desireth
evil
his
neighbour
findeth
no
favour
in
his
eyes
when
the
scorner
is
punished
the
simple
is
made
wise
and
when
the
wise
is
instructed
he
receiveth
knowledge
the
righteous
man
wisely
considereth
the
house
of
the
wicked
but
god
overthroweth
the
wicked
for
their
wickedness
whoso
stoppeth
his
ears
at
the
cry
of
the
poor
he
also
shall
cry
himself
but
shall
not
be
heard
a
gift
in
secret
pacifieth
anger
and
a
reward
in
the
bosom
strong
wrath
it
is
joy
to
the
just
to
do
judgment
but
destruction
shall
be
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
the
man
that
wandereth
out
of
the
way
of
understanding
shall
remain
in
the
congregation
of
the
dead
he
that
loveth
pleasure
shall
be
a
poor
man
he
that
loveth
wine
and
oil
shall
not
be
rich
the
wicked
shall
be
a
ransom
for
the
righteous
and
the
transgressor
for
the
upright
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
wilderness
than
with
a
contentious
and
an
angry
woman
there
is
treasure
to
be
desired
and
oil
in
the
dwelling
of
the
wise
but
a
foolish
man
spendeth
it
up
he
that
followeth
after
righteousness
and
mercy
findeth
life
righteousness
and
honour
a
wise
man
scaleth
the
city
of
the
mighty
and
casteth
down
the
strength
of
the
confidence
thereof
whoso
keepeth
his
mouth
and
his
tongue
keepeth
his
soul
from
troubles
proud
and
haughty
scorner
is
his
name
who
dealeth
in
proud
wrath
the
desire
of
the
slothful
killeth
him
for
his

he
coveteth
greedily
all
the
day
long
but
the
righteous
giveth
and
spareth
not
the
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
abomination
how
much
more
when
he
bringeth
it
with
a
wicked
mind
a
false
witness
shall
perish
but
the
man
that
heareth
speaketh
constantly
a
wicked
man
hardeneth
his
face
but
as
for
the
upright
he
directeth
his
way
there
is
no
wisdom
nor
understanding
nor
counsel
against
the
lord
the
horse
is
prepared
against
the
day
of
battle
but
safety
is
of
the
lord
a
good
name
is
rather
to
be
chosen
than
great
riches
and
loving
favour
rather
than
silver
and
gold
the
rich
and
poor
meet
together
the
lord
is
the
maker
of
them
all
a
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil
and
hideth
himself
but
the
simple
pass
on
and
are
punished
by
humility
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
are
riches
and
honour
and
life
thorns
and
snares
are
in
the
way
of
the
froward
he
that
doth
keep
his
soul
shall
be
far
from
them
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
the
rich
ruleth
over
the
poor
and
the
borrower
is
servant
to
the
lender
he
that
soweth
iniquity
shall
reap
vanity
and
the
rod
of
his
anger
shall
fail
he
that
hath
a
bountiful
eye
shall
be
blessed
for
he
giveth
of
his
bread
to
the
poor
cast
out
the
scorner
and
contention
shall
go
out
yea
strife
and
reproach
shall
cease
he
that
loveth
pureness
of
heart
for
the
grace
of
his
lips
the
king
shall
be
his
friend
the
eyes
of
the
lord
preserve
knowledge
and
he
overthroweth
the
words
of
the
transgressor
the
slothful
man
saith
there
is
a
lion
without
i
shall
be
slain
in
the
streets
the
mouth
of
strange
women
is
a
deep
pit
he
that
is
abhorred
of
the
lord
shall
fall
therein
foolishness
is
bound
in
the
heart
of
a
child
but
the
rod
of
correction
shall
drive
it
far
from
him
he
that
oppresseth
the
poor
to
increase
his
riches
and
he
that
giveth
to
the
rich
shall
surely
come
to
want
bow
down
thine
ear
and
hear
the
words
of
the
wise
and
apply
thine
heart
unto
my
knowledge
for
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
if
thou
keep
them
within
thee
they
shall
withal
be
fitted
in
thy
lips
that
thy
trust
may
be
in
the
lord
i
have
made
known
to
thee
this
day
even
to
thee
have
not
i
written
to
thee
excellent
things
in
counsels
and
knowledge
that
i
might
make
thee
know
the
certainty
of
the
words
of
truth
that
thou
mightest
answer
the
words
of
truth
to
them
that
send
unto
thee
rob
not
the
poor
because
he
is
poor
neither
oppress
the
afflicted
in
the
gate
for
the
lord
will
plead
their
cause
and
spoil
the
soul
of
those
that
spoiled
them
make
no
friendship
with
an
angry
man
and
with
a
furious
man
thou
shalt
not
go
lest
thou
learn
his
ways
and
get
a
snare
to
thy
soul
be
not
thou
one
of
them
that
strike
hands
or
of
them
that
are
sureties
for
debts
if
thou
hast
nothing
to
pay
why
should
he
take
away
thy
bed
from
under
thee
remove
not
the
ancient
landmark
which
thy
fathers
have
set
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
kings
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
men
when
thou
sittest
to
eat
with
a
ruler
consider
diligently
what
is
before
thee
and
put
a
knife
to
thy
throat
if
thou
be
a
man

to
appetite
be
not
desirous
of
his
dainties
for
they
are
deceitful
meat
labour
not
to
be
rich
cease
from
thine
own
wisdom
wilt
thou
set
thine
eyes
upon
that
which
is
not
for
riches
certainly
make
themselves
wings
they
fly
away
as
an
eagle
toward
heaven
eat
thou
not
the
bread
of
him
that
hath
an
evil
eye
neither
desire
thou
his
dainty
meats
for
as
he
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
eat
and
drink
saith
he
to
thee
but
his
heart
is
not
with
thee
the
morsel
which
thou
hast
eaten
shalt
thou
vomit
up
and
lose
thy
sweet
words
speak
not
in
the
ears
of
a
fool
for
he
will
despise
the
wisdom
of
thy
words
remove
not
the
old
landmark
and
enter
not
into
the
fields
of
the
fatherless
for
their
redeemer
is
mighty
he
shall
plead
their
cause
with
thee
apply
thine
heart
unto
instruction
and
thine
ears
to
the
words
of
knowledge
withhold
not
correction
from
the
child
for
if
thou
beatest
him
with
the
rod
he
shall
not
die
thou
shalt
beat
him
with
the
rod
and
shalt
deliver
his
soul
from
hell
my
son
if
thine
heart
be
wise
my
heart
shall
rejoice
even
mine
yea
my
reins
shall
rejoice
when
thy
lips
speak
right
things
let
not
thine
heart
envy
sinners
but
be
thou
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
all
the
day
long
for
surely
there
is
an
end
and
thine
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off
hear
thou
my
son
and
be
wise
and
guide
thine
heart
in
the
way
be
not
among
winebibbers
among
riotous
eaters
of
flesh
for
the
drunkard
and
the
glutton
shall
come
to
poverty
and
drowsiness
shall
clothe
a

unto
thy
father
that
begat
thee
and
despise
not
thy
mother
when
she
is
old
buy
the
truth
and
sell
it
not
also
wisdom
and
instruction
and
understanding
the
father
of
the
righteous
shall
greatly
rejoice
and
he
that
begetteth
a
wise
child
shall
have
joy
of
him
thy
father
and
thy
mother
shall
be
glad
and
she
that
bare
thee
shall
rejoice
my
son
give
me
thine
heart
and
let
thine
eyes
observe
my
ways
for
a
whore
is
a
deep
ditch
and
a
strange
woman
is
a
narrow
pit
she
also
lieth
in
wait
as
for
a
prey
and
increaseth
the
transgressors
among
men
who
hath
woe
who
hath
sorrow
who

babbling
who

wounds

they
that
go

mixed
wine
look
not
thou
upon
the
wine
when
it
is
red
when
it
giveth
his
colour
in
the
cup
when
it
moveth
itself
aright
at
the
last
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
an
adder
thine
eyes
shall
behold
strange
women
and
thine
heart
shall
utter
perverse
things
yea
thou
shalt
be
as
he
that
lieth
down
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
or
as
he
that
lieth
upon
the
top
of
a
mast
they
have
stricken
me
shalt
thou
say
and
i
was
not
sick
they
have
beaten
me
and
i
felt
it
not
when
shall
i
awake
i
will
seek
it
yet
again
be

thou
envious
against
evil
men
neither

mischief
through
wisdom

an
house
builded
and
by
understanding
it
is
established
and
by
knowledge
shall
the
chambers
be
filled
with
all
precious
and
pleasant
riches
a
wise
man
is
strong
yea
a
man
of
knowledge
increaseth
strength
for
by
wise
counsel
thou
shalt
make
thy
war
and
in
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety
wisdom
is
too
high
for
a
fool
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
in
the
gate
he
that
deviseth
to
do
evil
shall
be
called
a
mischievous
person
the
thought
of
foolishness
is
sin
and
the
scorner
is
an
abomination
to
men
if
thou
faint
in
the
day
of
adversity
thy
strength
is
small
if
thou
forbear
to
deliver
them
that
are
drawn
unto
death
and
those
that
are
ready
to
be
slain
if
thou
sayest
behold
we
knew
it
not
doth
not
he
that
pondereth
the
heart
consider
it
and
he
that
keepeth
thy
soul
doth
not
he
know
it
and
shall
not
he
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
works
my
son
eat
thou
honey
because
it
is
good
and
the
honeycomb
which
is
sweet
to
thy
taste
so
shall
the
knowledge
of
wisdom
be
unto
thy
soul
when
thou
hast
found
it
then
there
shall
be
a
reward
and
thy
expectation
shall
not
be
cut
off
lay
not
wait
o
wicked
man
against
the
dwelling
of
the
righteous
spoil
not
his
resting
place
for
a
just
man
falleth
seven
times
and
riseth
up
again
but
the
wicked
shall
fall
into
mischief
rejoice
not
when
thine
enemy
falleth
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
glad
when
he
stumbleth
lest
the
lord
see
it
and
it
displease
him
and
he
turn
away
his
wrath
from
him
fret
not
thyself
because
of
evil
men
neither
be
thou
envious
at
the
wicked
for
there
shall
be
no
reward
to
the
evil
man
the
candle
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
my
son
fear
thou
the
lord
and
the
king
and
meddle
not
with
them
that
are
given
to
change
for
their
calamity
shall
rise
suddenly
and
who
knoweth
the
ruin
of
them
both
these
things
also
belong
to
the
wise
it
is
not
good
to
have
respect
of
persons
in
judgment
he
that
saith
unto
the
wicked
thou
are
righteous
him
shall
the
people
curse
nations
shall
abhor
him
but
to
them
that
rebuke
him
shall
be
delight
and
a
good
blessing
shall
come
upon
them
every
man
shall
kiss
his
lips
that
giveth
a
right
answer
prepare
thy
work
without
and
make
it
fit
for
thyself
in
the
field
and
afterwards
build
thine
house
be
not
a
witness
against
thy
neighbour
without
cause
and
deceive
not
with
thy
lips
say
not
i
will
do
so
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
me
i
will
render
to
the
man
according
to
his
work
i
went
by
the
field
of
the
slothful
and
by
the
vineyard
of
the
man
void
of
understanding
and
lo
it
was
all
grown
over
with
thorns
and
nettles
had
covered
the
face
thereof
and
the
stone
wall
thereof
was
broken
down
then
i
saw
and
considered
it
well
i
looked
upon
it
and
received
instruction
yet
a
little
sleep
a
little
slumber
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
sleep
so
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man
these
are
also
proverbs
of
solomon
which
the
men
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
copied
out
it
is
the
glory
of
god
to
conceal
a
thing
but
the
honour
of
kings
is
to
search
out
a
matter
the
heaven
for
height
and
the
earth
for
depth
and
the
heart
of
kings
is
unsearchable
take
away
the
dross
from
the
silver
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
vessel
for
the
finer
take
away
the
wicked
from
before
the
king
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
in
righteousness
put
not
forth
thyself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
stand
not
in
the
place
of
great
men
for
better
it
is
that
it
be
said
unto
thee
come
up
hither
than
that
thou
shouldest
be
put
lower
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
whom
thine
eyes
have
seen
go
not
forth
hastily
to
strive
lest
thou
know
not
what
to
do
in
the
end
thereof
when
thy
neighbour
hath
put
thee
to
shame
debate
thy
cause
with
thy
neighbour
himself
and
discover
not
a
secret
to
another
lest
he
that
heareth
it
put
thee
to
shame
and
thine
infamy
turn
not
away
a
word
fitly
spoken
is
like
apples
of
gold
in
pictures
of
silver
as
an
earring
of
gold
and
an
ornament
of
fine
gold
so
is
a
wise
reprover
upon
an
obedient
ear
as
the
cold
of
snow
in
the
time
of
harvest
so
is
a
faithful
messenger
to
them
that
send
him
for
he
refresheth
the
soul
of
his
masters
whoso
boasteth
himself
of
a
false
gift
is
like
clouds
and
wind
without
rain
by
long
forbearing
is
a
prince
persuaded
and
a
soft
tongue
breaketh
the
bone
hast
thou
found
honey
eat
so
much
as
is
sufficient
for
thee
lest
thou
be
filled
therewith
and
vomit
it
withdraw
thy
foot
from
thy
neighbour's
house
lest
he
be
weary
of
thee
and
so
hate
thee
a
man
that
beareth
false
witness
against
his
neighbour
is
a
maul
and
a
sword
and
a
sharp
arrow
confidence
in
an
unfaithful
man
in
time
of
trouble
is
like
a
broken
tooth
and
a
foot
out
of
joint
as
he
that
taketh
away
a
garment
in
cold
weather
and
as
vinegar
upon
nitre
so
is
he
that
singeth
songs
to
an
heavy
heart
if
thine
enemy
be
hungry
give
him
bread
to
eat
and
if
he
be
thirsty
give
him
water
to
drink
for
thou
shalt
heap
coals
of
fire
upon
his
head
and
the
lord
shall
reward
thee
the
north
wind
driveth
away
rain
so
doth
an
angry
countenance
a
backbiting
tongue
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
the
corner
of
the
housetop
than
with
a
brawling
woman
and
in
a
wide
house
as
cold
waters
to
a
thirsty
soul
so
is
good
news
from
a
far
country
a
righteous
man
falling
down
before
the
wicked
is
as
a
troubled
fountain
and
a
corrupt
spring
it
is
not
good
to
eat
much
honey
so
for
men
to
search
their
own
glory
is
not
glory
he
that
hath
no
rule
over
his
own
spirit
is
like
a
city
that
is
broken
down
and
without
walls
as
snow
in
summer
and
as
rain
in
harvest
so
honour
is
not
seemly
for
a
fool
as
the
bird
by
wandering
as
the
swallow
by
flying
so
the
curse
causeless
shall
not
come
a
whip
for
the
horse
a
bridle
for
the
ass
and
a
rod
for
the
fool's
back
answer
not
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
lest
thou
also
be
like
unto
him
answer
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
lest
he
be
wise
in
his
own
conceit
he
that
sendeth
a
message
by
the
hand
of
a
fool
cutteth
off
the
feet
and
drinketh
damage
the
legs
of
the
lame
are
not
equal
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouth
of
fools
as
he
that
bindeth
a
stone
in
a
sling
so
is
he
that
giveth
honour
to
a
fool
as
a
thorn
goeth
up
into
the
hand
of
a
drunkard
so
is
a
parable
in
the
mouths
of
fools
the
great
god
that
formed
all
things
both
rewardeth
the
fool
and
rewardeth
transgressors
as
a
dog
returneth
to
his
vomit
so
a
fool
returneth
to
his
folly
seest
thou
a
man
wise
in
his
own
conceit
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him
the
slothful
man
saith
there
is
a
lion
in
the
way
a
lion
is
in
the
streets
as
the
door
turneth
upon
his
hinges
so
doth
the
slothful
upon
his
bed
the
slothful
hideth
his
hand
in
his
bosom
it
grieveth
him
to
bring
it
again
to
his
mouth
the
sluggard
is
wiser
in
his
own
conceit
than
seven
men
that
can
render
a
reason
he
that
passeth
by
and
meddleth
with
strife
belonging
not
to
him
is
like
one
that
taketh
a
dog
by
the
ears
as
a
mad
man
who
casteth
firebrands
arrows
and
death
so
is
the
man
that
deceiveth
his
neighbour
and
saith
am
not
i
in
sport
where
no
wood
is
there
the
fire
goeth
out
so
where
there
is
no
talebearer
the
strife
ceaseth
as
coals
are
to
burning
coals
and
wood
to
fire
so
is
a
contentious
man
to
kindle
strife
the
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds
and
they
go
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
the
belly
burning
lips
and
a
wicked
heart
are
like
a
potsherd
covered
with
silver
dross
he
that
hateth
dissembleth
with
his
lips
and
layeth
up
deceit
within
him
when
he
speaketh
fair
believe
him
not
for
there
are
seven
abominations
in
his
heart
whose
hatred
is
covered
by
deceit
his
wickedness
shall
be
shewed
before
the
whole
congregation
whoso
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
therein
and
he
that
rolleth
a
stone
it
will
return
upon
him
a
lying
tongue
hateth
those
that
are
afflicted
by
it
and
a
flattering
mouth
worketh
ruin
boast
not
thyself
of
to
morrow
for
thou
knowest
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
let
another
man
praise
thee
and
not
thine
own
mouth
a
stranger
and
not
thine
own
lips
a
stone
is
heavy
and
the
sand
weighty
but
a
fool's
wrath
is
heavier
than
them
both
wrath
is
cruel
and
anger
is
outrageous
but
who
is
able
to
stand
before
envy
open
rebuke
is
better
than
secret
love
faithful
are
the
wounds
of
a
friend
but
the
kisses
of
an
enemy
are
deceitful
the
full

loatheth
an
honeycomb
but
to
the
hungry
soul
every
bitter
thing
is
sweet
as
a
bird
that
wandereth
from

nest
so
is
a
man
that
wandereth
from
his

ointment
and
perfume
rejoice
the
heart
so
doth
the
sweetness
of
a
man's
friend
by
hearty
counsel
thine
own
friend
and
thy
father's
friend
forsake
not
neither
go
into
thy
brother's
house
in
the
day
of
thy
calamity
for
better
is
a
neighbour
that
is
near
than
a
brother
far
off
my
son
be
wise
and
make
my
heart
glad
that
i
may
answer
him
that
reproacheth
me
a
prudent
man
foreseeth
the
evil
and
hideth
himself
but
the
simple
pass
on
and
are
punished
take
his
garment
that
is
surety
for
a
stranger
and
take
a
pledge
of
him
for
a
strange
woman
he
that
blesseth
his
friend
with
a
loud
voice
rising
early
in
the
morning
it
shall
be
counted
a
curse
to
him
a
continual
dropping
in
a
very
rainy
day
and
a
contentious
woman
are
alike
whosoever
hideth
her
hideth
the
wind
and
the
ointment
of
his
right
hand
which
bewrayeth
itself
iron
sharpeneth
iron
so
a
man
sharpeneth
the
countenance
of
his
friend
whoso
keepeth
the
fig
tree
shall
eat
the
fruit
thereof
so
he
that
waiteth
on
his
master
shall
be
honoured
as
in
water
face
answereth
to
face
so
the
heart
of
man
to
man
hell
and
destruction
are
never
full
so
the
eyes
of
man
are
never
satisfied
as
the
fining
pot
for
silver
and
the
furnace
for
gold
so
is
a
man
to
his
praise
though
thou
shouldest
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
among
wheat
with
a
pestle
yet
will
not
his
foolishness
depart
from
him
be
thou
diligent
to
know
the
state
of
thy
flocks
and
look
well
to
thy
herds
for
riches
are
not
for
ever
and
doth
the
crown
endure
to
every
generation
the
hay
appeareth
and
the
tender
grass
sheweth
itself
and
herbs
of
the
mountains
are
gathered
the
lambs
are
for
thy
clothing
and
the
goats
are
the
price
of
the
field
and
thou
shalt
have
goats
milk
enough
for
thy
food
for
the
food
of
thy
household
and
for
the
maintenance
for
thy
maidens
the
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
but
the
righteous
are
bold
as
a
lion
for
the
transgression
of
a
land
many
are
the
princes
thereof
but
by
a
man
of
understanding
and
knowledge
the
state
thereof
shall
be
prolonged
a
poor
man
that
oppresseth
the
poor
is
like
a
sweeping
rain
which
leaveth
no
food
they
that
forsake
the
law
praise
the
wicked
but
such
as
keep
the
law
contend
with
them
evil
men
understand
not
judgment
but
they
that
seek
the
lord
understand
all
things
better
is
the
poor
that
walketh
in
his
uprightness
than
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
though
he
be
rich
whoso
keepeth
the
law
is
a
wise
son
but
he
that
is
a
companion
of
riotous
men
shameth
his
father
he
that
by
usury
and
unjust
gain
increaseth
his
substance
he
shall
gather
it
for
him
that
will
pity
the
poor
he
that
turneth
away
his
ear
from
hearing
the
law
even
his
prayer
shall
be
abomination
whoso
causeth
the
righteous
to
go
astray
in
an
evil
way
he
shall
fall
himself
into
his
own
pit
but
the
upright
shall
have
good
things
in
possession
the
rich
man
is
wise
in
his
own
conceit
but
the
poor
that
hath
understanding
searcheth
him
out
when
righteous
men
do
rejoice
there
is
great
glory
but
when
the
wicked
rise
a
man
is
hidden
he
that
covereth
his
sins
shall
not
prosper
but
whoso
confesseth
and
forsaketh
them
shall
have
mercy
happy
is
the
man
that
feareth
alway
but
he
that
hardeneth
his
heart
shall
fall
into
mischief
as
a
roaring
lion
and
a
ranging
bear
so
is
a
wicked
ruler
over
the
poor
people
the
prince
that
wanteth
understanding
is
also
a
great
oppressor
but
he
that
hateth
covetousness
shall
prolong
his
days
a
man
that
doeth
violence
to
the
blood
of
any
person
shall
flee
to
the
pit
let
no
man
stay
him
whoso
walketh
uprightly
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
is
perverse
in
his
ways
shall
fall
at
once
he
that
tilleth
his
land
shall
have
plenty
of
bread
but
he
that
followeth
after
vain
persons
shall
have
poverty
enough
a
faithful
man
shall
abound
with
blessings
but
he
that
maketh
haste
to
be
rich
shall
not
be
innocent
to
have
respect
of
persons
is
not
good
for
for
a
piece
of
bread
that
man
will
transgress
he
that
hasteth
to
be
rich
hath
an
evil
eye
and
considereth
not
that
poverty
shall
come
upon
him
he
that
rebuketh
a
man
afterwards
shall
find
more
favour
than
he
that
flattereth
with
the
tongue
whoso
robbeth
his
father
or
his
mother
and
saith
it
is
no
transgression
the
same
is
the
companion
of
a
destroyer
he
that
is
of
a
proud
heart
stirreth
up
strife
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
made
fat
he
that
trusteth
in
his
own
heart
is
a
fool
but
whoso
walketh
wisely
he
shall
be
delivered
he
that
giveth
unto
the
poor
shall
not
lack
but
he
that
hideth
his
eyes
shall
have
many
a
curse
when
the
wicked
rise
men
hide
themselves
but
when
they
perish
the
righteous
increase
he
that
being
often
reproved
hardeneth
his
neck
shall
suddenly
be
destroyed
and
that
without
remedy
when
the
righteous
are
in
authority
the
people
rejoice
but
when
the
wicked
beareth
rule
the
people
mourn
whoso
loveth
wisdom
rejoiceth
his
father
but
he
that
keepeth
company
with
harlots
spendeth
his
substance
the
king
by
judgment
establisheth
the
land
but
he
that
receiveth
gifts
overthroweth
it
a
man
that
flattereth
his
neighbour
spreadeth
a
net
for
his
feet
in
the
transgression
of
an
evil
man
there
is
a
snare
but
the
righteous
doth
sing
and
rejoice
the
righteous
considereth
the
cause
of
the
poor
but
the
wicked
regardeth
not
to
know
it
scornful
men
bring
a
city
into
a
snare
but
wise
men
turn
away
wrath
if
a
wise
man
contendeth
with
a
foolish
man
whether
he
rage
or
laugh
there
is
no
rest
the
bloodthirsty
hate
the
upright
but
the
just
seek
his
soul
a
fool
uttereth
all
his
mind
but
a
wise
man
keepeth
it
in
till
afterwards
if
a
ruler
hearken
to
lies
all
his
servants
are
wicked
the
poor
and
the
deceitful
man
meet
together
the
lord
lighteneth
both
their
eyes
the
king
that
faithfully
judgeth
the
poor
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever
the
rod
and
reproof
give
wisdom
but
a
child
left
to
himself
bringeth
his
mother
to
shame
when
the
wicked
are
multiplied
transgression
increaseth
but
the
righteous
shall
see
their
fall
correct
thy
son
and
he
shall
give
thee
rest
yea
he
shall
give
delight
unto
thy
soul
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
but
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
he
a
servant
will
not
be
corrected
by
words
for
though
he
understand
he
will
not
answer
seest
thou
a
man
that
is
hasty
in
his
words
there
is
more
hope
of
a
fool
than
of
him
he
that
delicately
bringeth
up
his
servant
from
a
child
shall
have
him
become
his
son
at
the
length
an
angry
man
stirreth
up
strife
and
a
furious
man
aboundeth
in
transgression
a
man's
pride
shall
bring
him
low
but
honour
shall
uphold
the
humble
in
spirit
whoso
is
partner
with
a
thief
hateth
his
own
soul
he
heareth
cursing
and
bewrayeth
it
not
the
fear
of
man
bringeth
a
snare
but
whoso
putteth
his
trust
in
the
lord
shall
be
safe
many
seek
the
ruler's
favour
but
every
man's
judgment
cometh
from
the
lord
an
unjust
man
is
an
abomination
to
the
just
and
he
that
is
upright
in
the
way
is
abomination
to
the
wicked
the
words
of
agur
the
son
of
jakeh
even
the
prophecy
the
man
spake
unto
ithiel
even
unto
ithiel
and
ucal
surely
i
am
more
brutish
than
any
man
and
have
not
the
understanding
of
a
man
i
neither
learned
wisdom
nor
have
the
knowledge
of
the
holy
who
hath
ascended
up
into
heaven
or
descended
who
hath
gathered
the
wind
in
his

who
hath
bound
the
waters
in
a
garment
who
hath
established
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
what
is
his
name
and
what
is
his
son's
name
if
thou
canst
tell
every
word
of
god
is
pure
he
is
a
shield
unto
them
that
put
their
trust
in
him
add
thou
not
unto
his
words
lest
he
reprove
thee
and
thou
be
found
a
liar
two
things
have
i
required
of
thee
deny
me
them
not
before
i
die
remove
far
from
me
vanity
and
lies
give
me
neither
poverty
nor
riches
feed
me
with
food
convenient
for
me
lest
i
be
full
and
deny
thee
and
say
who
is
the
lord
or
lest
i
be
poor
and
steal
and
take
the
name
of
my
god
in
vain
accuse
not
a
servant
unto
his
master
lest
he
curse
thee
and
thou
be
found
guilty
there
is
a
generation
that
curseth
their
father
and
doth
not
bless
their
mother
there
is
a
generation
that
are
pure
in
their
own
eyes
and
yet
is
not
washed
from
their
filthiness
there
is
a
generation
o
how
lofty
are
their
eyes
and
their
eyelids
are
lifted
up
there
is
a
generation
whose
teeth
are
as
swords
and
their
jaw
teeth
as
knives
to
devour
the
poor
from
off
the
earth
and
the
needy
from
among
men
the
horseleach
hath
two
daughters
crying
give
give
there
are
three
things
that
are
never
satisfied
yea
four
things
say
not
it
is
enough
the
grave
and
the
barren
womb
the
earth
that
is
not
filled
with
water
and
the
fire
that
saith
not
it
is
enough
the
eye
that
mocketh
at
his
father
and
despiseth
to
obey
his
mother
the
ravens
of
the
valley
shall
pick
it
out
and
the
young
eagles
shall
eat
it
there
be
three
things
which
are
too
wonderful
for
me
yea
four
which
i
know
not
the
way
of
an
eagle
in
the
air
the
way
of
a
serpent
upon
a
rock
the
way
of
a
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
the
way
of
a
man
with
a
maid
such
is
the
way
of
an
adulterous
woman
she
eateth
and
wipeth
her
mouth
and
saith
i
have
done
no
wickedness
for
three
things
the
earth
is
disquieted
and
for
four
which
it
cannot
bear
for
a
servant
when
he
reigneth
and
a
fool
when
he
is
filled
with
meat
for
an
odious
woman
when
she
is
married
and
an
handmaid
that
is
heir
to
her
mistress
there
be
four
things
which
are
little
upon
the
earth
but
they
are
exceeding
wise
the
ants
are
a
people
not
strong
yet
they
prepare
their
meat
in
the
summer
the
conies
are
but
a
feeble
folk
yet
make
they
their
houses
in
the
rocks
the
locusts
have
no
king
yet
go
they
forth
all
of
them
by
bands
the
spider
taketh
hold
with
her
hands
and
is
in
kings
palaces
there
be
three
things
which
go
well
yea
four
are
comely
in
going
a
lion
which
is
strongest
among
beasts
and
turneth
not
away
for
any
a
greyhound
an
he
goat
also
and
a
king
against
whom
there
is
no
rising
up
if
thou
hast
done
foolishly
in
lifting
up
thyself
or
if
thou
hast
thought
evil
lay
thine
hand
upon
thy
mouth
surely
the
churning
of
milk
bringeth
forth
butter
and
the
wringing
of
the
nose
bringeth
forth
blood
so
the
forcing
of
wrath
bringeth
forth
strife
the
words
of
king
lemuel
the
prophecy
that
his
mother
taught
him
what
my
son
and
what
the
son
of
my
womb
and
what
the
son
of
my
vows
give
not
thy
strength
unto
women
nor
thy
ways
to
that
which
destroyeth
kings
it
is
not
for
kings
o
lemuel
it
is
not
for
kings
to
drink
wine
nor
for
princes
strong
drink
lest
they
drink
and
forget
the
law
and
pervert
the
judgment
of
any
of
the
afflicted
give
strong
drink
unto
him
that
is
ready
to
perish
and
wine
unto
those
that
be
of
heavy
hearts
let
him
drink
and
forget
his
poverty
and
remember
his
misery
no
more
open
thy
mouth
for
the
dumb
in
the
cause
of
all
such
as
are
appointed
to
destruction
open
thy
mouth
judge
righteously
and
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy
who
can
find
a
virtuous
woman
for
her
price
is
far
above
rubies
the
heart
of
her
husband
doth
safely
trust
in
her
so
that
he
shall
have
no
need
of
spoil
she
will
do
him
good
and
not
evil
all
the
days
of
her
life
she
seeketh
wool
and
flax
and
worketh
willingly
with
her
hands
she
is
like
the
merchants
ships
she
bringeth
her
food
from
afar
she
riseth
also
while
it
is
yet
night
and
giveth
meat
to
her
household
and
a
portion
to
her
maidens
she
considereth
a
field
and
buyeth
it
with
the
fruit
of
her
hands
she
planteth
a
vineyard
she
girdeth
her
loins
with
strength
and
strengtheneth
her
arms
she
perceiveth
that
her
merchandise
is
good
her
candle
goeth
not
out
by
night
she
layeth
her
hands
to
the
spindle
and
her
hands
hold
the
distaff
she
stretcheth
out
her
hand
to
the
poor
yea
she
reacheth
forth
her
hands
to
the
needy
she
is
not
afraid
of
the
snow
for
her
household
for
all
her
household
are
clothed
with
scarlet
she
maketh
herself
coverings
of
tapestry
her
clothing
is
silk
and
purple
her
husband
is
known
in
the

when
he
sitteth
among
the
elders
of
the
land
she
maketh
fine
linen
and
selleth
it
and
delivereth
girdles
unto
the
merchant
strength
and
honour
are
her
clothing
and
she
shall
rejoice
in
time
to
come
she
openeth
her
mouth
with
wisdom
and
in
her
tongue
is
the
law
of
kindness
she
looketh
well
to
the
ways
of
her
household
and
eateth
not
the
bread
of
idleness
her
children
arise
up
and
call
her
blessed
her
husband
also
and
he
praiseth
her
many
daughters

done
virtuously
but
thou
excellest
them
all
favour
is
deceitful
and
beauty
is
vain
but
a
woman
that
feareth
the
lord
she
shall
be
praised
give
her
of

all
the

yet
the
sea
is
not
full
unto
the
place
from
whence
the
rivers
come
thither
they

again
all
things
are
full
of
labour
man
cannot
utter
it
the
eye
is
not
satisfied
with
seeing
nor
the
ear
filled
with
hearing
the
thing
that
hath
been
it
is
that
which
shall
be
and
that
which
is
done
is
that
which
shall
be
done
and
there
is
no
new
thing
under

is
there
any
thing
whereof
it
may
be
said
see
this
is
new
it
hath
been
already
of
old

which
was

there
is

of
former

neither

there

after
i
the
preacher
was
king
over
israel
in
jerusalem
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
seek
and
search
out
by
wisdom
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
heaven
this
sore
travail
hath
god
given
to
the
sons
of
man
to
be
exercised
therewith
i
have
seen
all
the
works
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
that
which
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
and
that
which
is
wanting
cannot
be
numbered
i
communed
with
mine
own
heart
saying
lo
i
am
come
to
great
estate
and
have
gotten
more
wisdom
than
all
they
that
have
been
before
me
in
jerusalem
yea
my
heart
had
great
experience
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
i
gave
my
heart
to
know
wisdom
and
to
know
madness
and
folly
i
perceived
that
this
also
is
vexation
of
spirit
for
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
i
said
in
mine
heart
go
to
now
i
will
prove
thee
with
mirth
therefore
enjoy
pleasure
and
behold
this
also
is
vanity
i
said
of
laughter
it
is
mad
and
of
mirth
what
doeth
it
i
sought
in
mine
heart
to
give
myself
unto
wine
yet
acquainting
mine
heart
with
wisdom
and
to
lay
hold
on
folly
till
i
might
see
what
was
that
good
for
the
sons
of
men
which
they
should
do
under
the
heaven
all
the
days
of
their
life
i
made
me
great
works
i
builded
me
houses
i
planted
me
vineyards
i
made
me
gardens
and
orchards
and
i
planted
trees
in
them
of
all
kind
of
fruits
i
made
me
pools
of
water
to
water
therewith
the
wood
that
bringeth
forth
trees
i
got
me
servants
and
maidens
and
had
servants
born
in
my
house
also
i
had
great
possessions
of
great
and
small
cattle
above
all
that
were
in
jerusalem
before
me
i
gathered
me
also
silver
and
gold
and
the
peculiar
treasure
of
kings
and
of
the
provinces
i
gat
me
men
singers
and
women
singers
and
the
delights
of
the
sons
of
men
as
musical
instruments
and
that
of
all
sorts
so
i
was
great
and
increased
more
than
all
that
were
before
me
in
jerusalem
also
my
wisdom
remained
with
me
and
whatsoever
mine
eyes
desired
i
kept
not
from
them
i
withheld
not
my
heart
from
any
joy
for
my
heart
rejoiced
in
all
my
labour
and
this
was
my
portion
of
all
my
labour
then
i
looked
on
all
the
works
that
my
hands
had
wrought
and
on
the
labour
that
i
had
laboured
to
do
and
behold
all
was
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
and
there
was
no
profit
under
the
sun
and
i
turned
myself
to
behold
wisdom
and
madness
and
folly
for
what
can
the
man
do
that
cometh
after
the
king
even
that
which
hath
been
already
done
then
i
saw
that
wisdom
excelleth
folly
as
far
as
light
excelleth
darkness
the
wise
man's
eyes
are
in
his
head
but
the
fool
walketh
in
darkness
and
i
myself
perceived
also
that
one
event
happeneth
to
them
all
then
said
i
in
my
heart
as
it
happeneth
to
the
fool
so
it
happeneth
even
to
me
and
why
was
i
then
more
wise
then
i
said
in
my
heart
that
this
also
is
vanity
for
there
is
no
remembrance
of
the
wise
more
than
of
the
fool
for
ever
seeing
that
which
now
is
in
the
days
to
come
shall
all
be
forgotten
and
how
dieth
the
wise
man
as
the
fool
therefore
i
hated
life
because
the
work
that
is
wrought
under
the
sun
is
grievous
unto
me
for
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
yea
i
hated
all
my
labour
which
i
had
taken
under
the
sun
because
i
should
leave
it
unto
the
man
that
shall
be
after
me
and
who
knoweth
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
man
or
a
fool
yet
shall
he
have
rule
over
all
my
labour
wherein
i
have
laboured
and
wherein
i
have
shewed
myself
wise
under
the
sun
this
is
also
vanity
therefore
i
went
about
to
cause
my
heart
to
despair
of
all
the
labour
which
i
took
under
the
sun
for
there
is
a
man
whose
labour
is
in
wisdom
and
in
knowledge
and
in
equity
yet
to
a
man
that
hath
not
laboured
therein
shall
he
leave
it
for
his
portion
this
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
evil
for
what
hath
man
of
all
his
labour
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
heart
wherein
he
hath
laboured
under
the
sun
for
all
his
days
are
sorrows
and
his
travail
grief
yea
his
heart
taketh
not
rest
in
the
night
this
is
also
vanity
there
is
nothing
better
for
a
man
than
that
he
should
eat
and
drink
and
that
he
should
make
his
soul
enjoy
good
in
his
labour
this
also
i
saw
that
it
was
from
the
hand
of
god
for
who
can
eat
or
who
else
can
hasten
hereunto
more
than
i
for
god
giveth
to
a
man
that
is
good
in
his
sight
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
joy
but
to
the
sinner
he
giveth
travail
to
gather
and
to
heap
up
that
he
may
give
to
him
that
is
good
before
god
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
to
every
thing
there
is
a
season
and
a
time
to
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
a
time
to
be
born
and
a
time
to
die
a
time
to
plant
and
a
time
to
pluck
up
that
which
is
planted
a
time
to
kill
and
a
time
to
heal
a
time
to
break
down
and
a
time
to
build
up
a
time
to
weep
and
a
time
to
laugh
a
time
to
mourn
and
a
time
to
dance
a
time
to
cast
away
stones
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
together
a
time
to
embrace
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
embracing
a
time
to
get
and
a
time
to
lose
a
time
to
keep
and
a
time
to
cast
away
a
time
to
rend
and
a
time
to
sew
a
time
to
keep
silence
and
a
time
to
speak
a
time
to
love
and
a
time
to
hate
a
time
of
war
and
a
time
of
peace
what
profit
hath
he
that
worketh
in
that
wherein
he
laboureth
i
have
seen
the
travail
which
god
hath
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
be
exercised
in
it
he
hath
made
every
thing
beautiful
in
his
time
also
he
hath
set
the
world
in
their
heart
so
that
no
man
can
find
out
the
work
that
god
maketh
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
i
know
that
there
is
no
good
in
them
but
for
a
man
to
rejoice
and
to
do
good
in
his
life
and
also
that
every
man
should
eat
and
drink
and
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
it
is
the
gift
of
god
i
know
that
whatsoever
god
doeth
it
shall
be
for
ever
nothing
can
be
put
to
it
nor
any
thing
taken
from
it
and
god
doeth
it
that
men
should
fear
before
him
that
which
hath
been
is
now
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
and
god
requireth
that
which
is
past
and
moreover
i
saw
under
the
sun
the
place
of
judgment
that
wickedness
was
there
and
the
place
of
righteousness
that
iniquity
was
there
i
said
in
mine
heart
god
shall
judge
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
for
there
is
a
time
there
for
every
purpose
and
for
every
work
i
said
in
mine
heart
concerning
the
estate
of
the
sons
of
men
that
god
might
manifest
them
and
that
they
might
see
that
they
themselves
are
beasts
for
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
beasts
even
one
thing
befalleth
them
as
the
one
dieth
so
dieth
the
other
yea
they
have
all
one
breath
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preeminence
above
a
beast
for
all
is
vanity
all
go
unto
one
place
all
are
of
the
dust
and
all
turn
to
dust
again
who
knoweth
the
spirit
of
man
that
goeth
upward
and
the
spirit
of
the
beast
that
goeth
downward
to
the
earth
wherefore
i
perceive
that
there
is
nothing
better
than
that
a
man
should
rejoice
in
his
own
works
for
that
is
his
portion
for
who
shall
bring
him
to
see
what
shall
be
after
him
so
i
returned
and
considered
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
behold
the
tears
of
such
as
were
oppressed
and
they
had
no
comforter
and
on
the
side
of
their
oppressors
there
was
power
but
they
had
no
comforter
wherefore
i
praised
the
dead
which
are
already
dead
more
than
the
living
which
are
yet
alive
yea
better
is
he
than
both
they
which
hath
not
yet
been
who
hath
not
seen
the
evil
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
again
i
considered
all
travail
and
every
right
work
that
for
this
a
man
is
envied
of
his
neighbour
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
the
fool
foldeth
his
hands
together
and
eateth
his
own
flesh
better
is
an
handful
with
quietness
than
both
the
hands
full
with
travail
and
vexation
of
spirit
then
i
returned
and
i
saw
vanity
under
the
sun
there
is
one
alone
and
there
is
not
a
second
yea
he
hath
neither
child
nor
brother
yet
is
there
no
end
of
all
his
labour
neither
is
his
eye
satisfied
with
riches
neither
saith
he
for
whom
do
i
labour
and
bereave
my
soul
of
good
this
is
also
vanity
yea
it
is
a
sore
travail
two
are
better
than
one
because
they
have
a
good
reward
for
their
labour
for
if
they
fall
the
one
will
lift
up
his
fellow
but
woe
to
him
that
is
alone
when
he
falleth
for
he
hath
not
another
to
help
him
up
again
if
two
lie
together
then
they
have
heat
but
how
can
one
be
warm
alone
and
if
one
prevail
against
him
two
shall
withstand
him
and
a
threefold
cord
is
not
quickly
broken
better
is
a
poor
and
a
wise
child
than
an
old
and
foolish
king
who
will
no
more
be
admonished
for
out
of
prison
he
cometh
to
reign
whereas
also
he
that
is
born
in
his
kingdom
becometh
poor
i
considered
all
the
living
which
walk
under
the
sun
with
the
second
child
that
shall
stand
up
in
his
stead
there
is
no
end
of
all
the
people
even
of
all
that
have
been
before
them
they
also
that
come
after
shall
not
rejoice
in
him
surely
this
also
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
keep
thy
foot
when
thou
goest
to
the
house
of
god
and
be
more
ready
to
hear
than
to
give
the
sacrifice
of
fools
for
they
consider
not
that
they
do
evil
be
not
rash
with
thy
mouth
and
let
not
thine
heart
be
hasty
to
utter
any
thing
before
god
for
god
is
in
heaven
and
thou
upon
earth
therefore
let
thy
words
be
few
for
a
dream
cometh
through
the
multitude
of
business
and
a
fool's
voice
is
known
by
multitude
of
words
when
thou
vowest
a
vow
unto
god
defer
not
to
pay
it
for
he
hath
no
pleasure
in
fools
pay
that
which
thou
hast
vowed
better
is
it
that
thou
shouldest
not
vow
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
pay
suffer
not
thy
mouth
to
cause
thy
flesh
to
sin
neither
say
thou
before
the
angel
that
it
was
an
error
wherefore
should
god
be
angry
at
thy
voice
and
destroy
the
work
of
thine
hands
for
in
the
multitude
of
dreams
and
many
words
there
are
also
divers
vanities
but
fear
thou
god
if
thou
seest
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
violent
perverting
of
judgment
and
justice
in
a
province
marvel
not
at
the
matter
for
he
that
is
higher
than
the
highest
regardeth
and
there
be
higher
than
they
moreover
the
profit
of
the
earth
is
for
all
the
king
himself
is
served
by
the
field
he
that
loveth
silver
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
silver
nor
he
that
loveth
abundance
with
increase
this
is
also
vanity
when
goods
increase
they
are
increased
that
eat
them
and
what
good
is
there
to
the
owners
thereof
saving
the
beholding
of
them
with
their
eyes
the
sleep
of
a
labouring
man
is
sweet
whether
he
eat
little
or
much
but
the
abundance
of
the
rich
will
not
suffer
him
to
sleep
there
is
a
sore
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
namely
riches
kept
for
the
owners
thereof
to
their
hurt
but
those
riches
perish
by
evil
travail
and
he
begetteth
a
son
and
there
is
nothing
in
his
hand
as
he
came
forth
of
his
mother's
womb
naked
shall
he
return
to
go
as
he
came
and
shall
take
nothing
of
his
labour
which
he
may
carry
away
in
his
hand
and
this
also
is
a
sore
evil
that
in
all
points
as
he
came
so
shall
he
go
and
what
profit
hath
he
that
hath
laboured
for
the
wind
all
his
days
also
he
eateth
in
darkness
and
he
hath
much
sorrow
and
wrath
with
his
sickness
behold
that
which
i
have
seen
it
is
good
and
comely
for
one
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
enjoy
the
good
of
all
his
labour
that
he
taketh
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
his
life
which
god
giveth
him
for
it
is
his
portion
every
man
also
to
whom
god
hath
given
riches
and
wealth
and
hath
given
him
power
to
eat
thereof
and
to
take
his
portion
and
to
rejoice
in
his
labour
this
is
the
gift
of
god
for
he
shall
not
much
remember
the
days
of
his
life
because
god
answereth
him
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
there
is
an
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
and
it
is
common
among
men
a
man
to
whom
god
hath
given
riches
wealth
and
honour
so
that
he
wanteth
nothing
for
his
soul
of
all
that
he
desireth
yet
god
giveth
him
not
power
to
eat
thereof
but
a
stranger
eateth
it
this
is
vanity
and
it
is
an
evil
disease
if
a
man
beget
an
hundred
children
and
live
many
years
so
that
the
days
of
his
years
be
many
and
his
soul
be
not
filled
with
good
and
also
that
he
have
no
burial
i
say
that
an
untimely
birth
is
better
than
he
for
he
cometh
in
with
vanity
and
departeth
in
darkness
and
his
name
shall
be
covered
with
darkness
moreover
he
hath
not
seen
the
sun
nor
known
any
thing
this
hath
more
rest
than
the
other
yea
though
he
live
a
thousand
years
twice
told
yet
hath
he
seen
no
good
do
not
all
go
to
one
place
all
the
labour
of
man
is
for
his
mouth
and
yet
the
appetite
is
not
filled
for
what
hath
the
wise
more
than
the
fool
what
hath
the
poor
that
knoweth
to
walk
before
the
living
better
is
the
sight
of
the
eyes
than
the
wandering
of
the
desire
this
is
also
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
that
which
hath
been
is
named
already
and
it
is
known
that
it
is
man
neither
may
he
contend
with
him
that
is
mightier
than
he
seeing
there
be
many
things
that
increase
vanity
what
is
man
the
better
for
who
knoweth
what
is
good
for
man
in
this
life
all
the
days
of
his
vain
life
which
he
spendeth
as
a
shadow
for
who
can
tell
a
man
what
shall
be
after
him
under
the
sun
a
good
name
is
better
than
precious
ointment
and
the
day
of
death
than
the
day
of
one's
birth
it
is
better
to
go
to
the
house
of
mourning
than
to
go
to
the
house
of
feasting
for
that
is
the
end
of
all
men
and
the
living
will
lay
it
to
his
heart
sorrow
is
better
than
laughter
for
by
the
sadness
of
the
countenance
the
heart
is
made
better
the
heart
of
the
wise
is
in
the
house
of
mourning
but
the
heart
of
fools
is
in
the
house
of
mirth
it
is
better
to
hear
the
rebuke
of
the
wise
than
for
a
man
to
hear
the
song
of
fools
for
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
so
is
the
laughter
of
the
fool
this
also
is
vanity
surely
oppression
maketh
a
wise
man
mad
and
a
gift
destroyeth
the
heart
better
is
the
end
of
a
thing
than
the
beginning
thereof
and
the
patient
in
spirit
is
better
than
the
proud
in
spirit
be
not
hasty
in
thy
spirit
to
be
angry
for
anger
resteth
in
the
bosom
of
fools
say
not
thou
what
is
the
cause
that
the
former
days
were
better
than
these
for
thou
dost
not
enquire
wisely
concerning
this
wisdom
is
good
with
an
inheritance
and
by
it
there
is
profit
to
them
that
see
the
sun
for
wisdom
is
a
defence
and
money
is
a
defence
but
the
excellency
of
knowledge
is
that
wisdom
giveth
life
to
them
that
have
it
consider
the
work
of
god
for
who
can
make
that
straight
which
he
hath
made
crooked
in
the
day
of
prosperity
be
joyful
but
in
the
day
of
adversity
consider
god
also
hath
set
the
one
over
against
the
other
to
the
end
that
man
should
find
nothing
after
him
all
things
have
i
seen
in
the
days
of
my
vanity
there
is
a
just
man
that
perisheth
in
his
righteousness
and
there
is
a
wicked
man
that
prolongeth
his
life
in
his
wickedness
be
not
righteous
over
much
neither
make
thyself
over
wise
why
shouldest
thou
destroy
thyself
be
not
over
much
wicked
neither
be
thou
foolish
why
shouldest
thou
die
before
thy
time
it
is
good
that
thou
shouldest
take
hold
of
this
yea
also
from
this
withdraw
not
thine
hand
for
he
that
feareth
god
shall
come
forth
of
them
all
wisdom
strengtheneth
the
wise
more
than
ten
mighty
men
which
are
in
the
city
for
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
earth
that
doeth
good
and
sinneth
not
also
take
no
heed
unto
all
words
that
are
spoken
lest
thou
hear
thy
servant
curse
thee
for
oftentimes
also
thine
own
heart
knoweth
that
thou
thyself
likewise
hast
cursed
others
all
this
have
i
proved
by
wisdom
i
said
i
will
be
wise
but
it
was
far
from
me
that
which
is
far
off
and
exceeding
deep
who
can
find
it
out
i
applied
mine
heart
to
know
and
to
search
and
to
seek
out
wisdom
and
the
reason
of
things
and
to
know
the
wickedness
of
folly
even
of
foolishness
and
madness
and
i
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
woman
whose
heart
is
snares
and
nets
and
her
hands
as
bands
whoso
pleaseth
god
shall
escape
from
her
but
the
sinner
shall
be
taken
by
her
behold
this
have
i
found
saith
the
preacher
counting
one
by
one
to
find
out
the
account
which
yet
my
soul
seeketh
but
i
find
not
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
i
found
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
i
not
found
lo
this
only
have
i
found
that
god
hath
made
man
upright
but
they
have
sought
out
many
inventions
who
is
as
the
wise
man
and
who
knoweth
the
interpretation
of
a
thing
a
man's
wisdom
maketh
his
face
to
shine
and
the
boldness
of
his
face
shall
be
changed
i
counsel
thee
to
keep
the
king's
commandment
and
that
in
regard
of
the
oath
of
god
be
not
hasty
to
go
out
of
his
sight
stand
not
in
an
evil
thing
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
pleaseth
him
where
the
word
of
a
king
is
there
is
power
and
who
may
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
whoso
keepeth
the
commandment
shall
feel
no
evil
thing
and
a
wise
man's
heart
discerneth
both
time
and
judgment
because
to
every
purpose
there
is
time
and
judgment
therefore
the
misery
of
man
is
great
upon
him
for
he
knoweth
not
that
which
shall
be
for
who
can
tell
him
when
it
shall
be
there
is
no
man
that
hath
power
over
the
spirit
to
retain
the
spirit
neither
hath
he
power
in
the
day
of
death
and
there
is
no
discharge
in
that
war
neither
shall
wickedness
deliver
those
that
are
given
to
it
all
this
have
i
seen
and
applied
my
heart
unto
every
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
there
is
a
time
wherein
one
man
ruleth
over
another
to
his
own
hurt
and
so
i
saw
the
wicked
buried
who
had
come
and
gone
from
the
place
of
the
holy
and
they
were
forgotten
in
the
city
where
they
had
so
done
this
is
also
vanity
because
sentence
against
an
evil
work
is
not
executed
speedily
therefore
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
fully
set
in
them
to
do
evil
though
a
sinner
do
evil
an
hundred
times
and
his
days
be
prolonged
yet
surely
i
know
that
it
shall
be
well
with
them
that
fear
god
which
fear
before
him
but
it
shall
not
be
well
with
the
wicked
neither
shall
he
prolong
his
days
which
are
as
a
shadow
because
he
feareth
not
before
god
there
is
a
vanity
which
is
done
upon
the
earth
that
there
be
just
men
unto
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
wicked
again
there
be
wicked
men
to
whom
it
happeneth
according
to
the
work
of
the
righteous
i
said
that
this
also
is
vanity
then
i
commended
mirth
because
a
man
hath
no
better
thing
under
the
sun
than
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
be
merry
for
that
shall
abide
with
him
of
his
labour
the
days
of
his
life
which
god
giveth
him
under
the
sun
when
i
applied
mine
heart
to
know
wisdom
and
to
see
the
business
that
is
done
upon
the
earth
for
also
there
is
that
neither
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
eyes
then
i
beheld
all
the
work
of
god
that
a
man
cannot
find
out
the
work
that
is
done
under
the
sun
because
though
a
man
labour
to
seek
it
out
yet
he
shall
not
find
it
yea
farther
though
a
wise
man
think
to
know
it
yet
shall
he
not
be
able
to
find
it
for
all
this
i
considered
in
my
heart
even
to
declare
all
this
that
the
righteous
and
the
wise
and
their
works
are
in
the
hand
of
god
no
man
knoweth
either
love
or
hatred
by
all
that
is
before
them
all
things
come
alike
to
all
there
is
one
event
to
the
righteous
and
to
the
wicked
to
the
good
and
to
the
clean
and
to
the
unclean
to
him
that
sacrificeth
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
not
as
is
the
good
so
is
the
sinner
and
he
that
sweareth
as
he
that
feareth
an
oath
this
is
an
evil
among
all
things
that
are
done
under
the
sun
that
there
is
one
event
unto
all
yea
also
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
evil
and
madness
is
in
their
heart
while
they
live
and
after
that
they
go
to
the
dead
for
to
him
that
is
joined
to
all
the
living
there
is
hope
for
a
living
dog
is
better
than
a
dead
lion
for
the
living
know
that
they
shall
die
but
the
dead
know
not
any
thing
neither
have
they
any
more
a
reward
for
the
memory
of
them
is
forgotten
also
their
love
and
their
hatred
and
their
envy
is
now
perished
neither
have
they
any
more
a
portion
for
ever
in
any
thing
that
is
done
under
the
sun
go
thy
way
eat
thy
bread
with
joy
and
drink
thy
wine
with
a
merry
heart
for
god
now
accepteth
thy
works
let
thy
garments
be
always
white
and
let
thy
head
lack
no
ointment
live
joyfully
with
the
wife
whom
thou
lovest
all
the
days
of
the
life
of
thy
vanity
which
he
hath
given
thee
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
thy
vanity
for
that
is
thy
portion
in
this
life
and
in
thy
labour
which
thou
takest
under
the
sun
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
for
there
is
no
work
nor
device
nor
knowledge
nor
wisdom
in
the
grave
whither
thou
goest
i
returned
and
saw
under
the
sun
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong
neither
yet
bread
to
the
wise
nor
yet
riches
to
men
of
understanding
nor
yet
favour
to
men
of
skill
but
time
and
chance
happeneth
to
them
all
for
man
also
knoweth
not
his
time
as
the
fishes
that
are
taken
in
an
evil
net
and
as
the
birds
that
are
caught
in
the
snare
so
are
the
sons
of
men
snared
in
an
evil
time
when
it
falleth
suddenly
upon
them
this
wisdom
have
i
seen
also
under
the
sun
and
it
seemed
great
unto
me
there
was
a
little
city
and
few
men
within
it
and
there
came
a
great
king
against
it
and
besieged
it
and
built
great
bulwarks
against
it
now
there
was
found
in
it
a
poor
wise
man
and
he
by
his
wisdom
delivered
the
city
yet
no
man
remembered
that
same
poor
man
then
said
i
wisdom
is
better
than
strength
nevertheless
the
poor
man's
wisdom
is
despised
and
his
words
are
not
heard
the
words
of
wise
men
are
heard
in
quiet
more
than
the
cry
of
him
that
ruleth
among
fools
wisdom
is
better
than
weapons
of
war
but
one
sinner
destroyeth
much
good
dead
flies
cause
the
ointment
of
the
apothecary
to
send
forth
a
stinking
savour
so
doth
a
little
folly
him
that
is
in
reputation
for
wisdom
and
honour
a
wise
man's
heart
is
at
his
right
hand
but
a
fool's
heart
at
his
left
yea
also
when
he
that
is
a
fool
walketh
by
the
way
his
wisdom
faileth
him
and
he
saith
to
every
one
that
he
is
a
fool
if
the
spirit
of
the
ruler
rise
up
against
thee
leave
not
thy
place
for
yielding
pacifieth
great
offences
there
is
an
evil
which
i
have
seen
under
the
sun
as
an
error
which
proceedeth
from
the
ruler
folly
is
set
in
great
dignity
and
the
rich
sit
in
low
place
i
have
seen
servants
upon
horses
and
princes
walking
as
servants
upon
the
earth
he
that
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
into
it
and
whoso
breaketh
an
hedge
a
serpent
shall
bite
him
whoso
removeth
stones
shall
be
hurt
therewith
and
he
that
cleaveth
wood
shall
be
endangered
thereby
if
the
iron
be
blunt
and
he
do
not
whet
the
edge
then
must
he
put
to
more
strength
but
wisdom
is
profitable
to
direct
surely
the
serpent
will
bite
without
enchantment
and
a
babbler
is
no
better
the
words
of
a
wise
man's
mouth
are
gracious
but
the
lips
of
a
fool
will
swallow
up
himself
the
beginning
of
the
words
of
his
mouth
is
foolishness
and
the
end
of
his
talk
is
mischievous
madness
a
fool
also
is
full
of
words
a
man
cannot
tell
what
shall
be
and
what
shall
be
after
him
who
can
tell
him
the
labour
of
the
foolish
wearieth
every
one
of
them
because
he
knoweth
not
how
to
go
to
the
city
woe
to
thee
o
land
when
thy
king
is
a
child
and
thy
princes
eat
in
the
morning
blessed
art
thou
o
land
when
thy
king
is
the
son
of
nobles
and
thy
princes
eat
in
due
season
for
strength
and
not
for
drunkenness
by
much
slothfulness
the
building
decayeth
and
through
idleness
of
the
hands
the
house
droppeth
through
a
feast
is
made
for
laughter
and
wine
maketh
merry
but
money
answereth
all
things
curse
not
the
king
no
not
in
thy
thought
and
curse
not
the
rich
in
thy
bedchamber
for
a
bird
of
the
air
shall
carry
the
voice
and
that
which
hath
wings
shall
tell
the
matter
cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
for
thou
shalt
find
it
after
many
days
give
a
portion
to
seven
and
also
to
eight
for
thou
knowest
not
what
evil
shall
be
upon
the
earth
if
the
clouds
be
full
of
rain
they
empty
themselves
upon
the
earth
and
if
the
tree
fall
toward
the
south
or
toward
the
north
in
the
place
where
the
tree
falleth
there
it
shall
be
he
that
observeth
the
wind
shall
not
sow
and
he
that
regardeth
the
clouds
shall
not
reap
as
thou
knowest
not
what
is
the
way
of
the
spirit
nor
how
the
bones
do
grow
in
the
womb
of
her
that
is
with
child
even
so
thou
knowest
not
the
works
of
god
who
maketh
all
in
the
morning
sow
thy
seed
and
in
the
evening
withhold
not
thine
hand
for
thou
knowest
not
whether
shall
prosper
either
this
or
that
or
whether
they
both
shall
be
alike
good
truly
the
light
is
sweet
and
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
for
the
eyes
to
behold
the
sun
but
if
a
man
live
many
years
and
rejoice
in
them
all
yet
let
him
remember
the
days
of
darkness
for
they
shall
be
many
all
that
cometh
is
vanity
rejoice
o
young
man
in
thy
youth
and
let
thy
heart
cheer
thee
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
and
walk
in
the
ways
of
thine
heart
and
in
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
but
know
thou
that
for
all
these
things
god
will
bring
thee
into
judgment
therefore
remove
sorrow
from
thy
heart
and
put
away
evil
from
thy
flesh
for
childhood
and
youth
are
vanity
remember
now
thy
creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
while
the
evil
days
come
not
nor
the
years
draw
nigh
when
thou
shalt
say
i
have
no
pleasure
in
them
while
the
sun
or
the
light
or
the
moon
or
the
stars
be
not
darkened
nor
the
clouds
return
after
the
rain
in
the
day
when
the
keepers
of
the
house
shall
tremble
and
the
strong
men
shall
bow
themselves
and
the
grinders
cease
because
they
are
few
and
those
that
look
out
of
the
windows
be
darkened
and
the
doors
shall
be
shut
in
the
streets
when
the
sound
of
the
grinding
is
low
and
he
shall
rise
up
at
the
voice
of
the
bird
and
all
the
daughters
of
musick
shall
be
brought
low
also
when
they
shall
be
afraid
of
that
which
is
high
and
fears
shall
be
in
the
way
and
the
almond
tree
shall
flourish
and
the
grasshopper
shall
be
a
burden
and
desire
shall
fail
because
man
goeth
to
his
long
home
and
the
mourners
go
about
the
streets
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain
or
the
wheel
broken
at
the
cistern
then
shall
the
dust
return
to
the
earth
as
it
was
and
the
spirit
shall
return
unto
god
who
gave
it
vanity
of
vanities
saith
the
preacher
all
is
vanity
and
moreover
because
the
preacher
was
wise
he
still
taught
the
people
knowledge
yea
he
gave
good
heed
and
sought
out
and
set
in
order
many
proverbs
the
preacher
sought
to
find
out
acceptable
words

into

with
every
secret
thing

it
be
good
or
whether
it
be
evil

i
in

as
one
that

favour
solomon

a
vineyard
at
baalhamon
he
let
out
the
vineyard
unto
keepers
every
one
for
the
fruit
thereof
was
to
bring
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver
my
vineyard
which
is
mine

before
me
thou
o
solomon
must
have
a
thousand
and
those
that
keep
the
fruit
thereof
two
hundred
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
gardens
the
companions
hearken
to
thy
voice
cause
me
to
hear
it
make
haste
my
beloved
and
be
thou
like
to
a
roe
or
to
a
young
hart
upon
the
mountains
of
spices
the
book
of
the
prophet
isaiah
the
vision
of
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
which
he
saw
concerning
judah
and
jerusalem
in
the
days
of
uzziah
jotham
ahaz
and
hezekiah
kings
of
judah
hear
o

and
give
ear
o
earth
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
i
have
nourished
and
brought
up
children
and
they
have
rebelled
against
me
the
ox
knoweth
his
owner
and
the
ass
his
master's
crib
but
israel
doth
not
know
my
people
doth
not
consider
ah
sinful
nation
a
people
laden
with
iniquity
a
seed
of
evildoers
children
that
are
corrupters
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
they
have
provoked
the
holy
one
of
israel
unto
anger
they
are
gone
away
backward
why
should
ye
be
stricken
any
more
ye
will
revolt
more
and
more
the
whole
head
is
sick
and
the
whole
heart
faint
from
the
sole
of
the
foot
even
unto
the
head
there
is
no
soundness
in
it
but
wounds
and
bruises
and
putrifying
sores
they
have
not
been
closed
neither
bound
up
neither
mollified
with
ointment
your
country
is
desolate
your
cities
are
burned
with
fire
your
land
strangers
devour
it
in
your
presence
and
it
is
desolate
as
overthrown
by
strangers
and
the
daughter
of
zion
is
left
as
a
cottage
in
a
vineyard
as
a
lodge
in
a
garden
of
cucumbers
as
a
besieged
city
except
the
lord
of
hosts
had
left
unto
us
a
very
small
remnant
we
should
have
been
as
sodom
and
we
should
have
been
like
unto
gomorrah
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
rulers
of
sodom
give
ear
unto
the
law
of
our
god
ye
people
of
gomorrah
to
what
purpose
is
the
multitude
of
your
sacrifices
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
am
full
of
the
burnt
offerings
of
rams
and
the
fat
of
fed
beasts
and
i
delight
not
in
the
blood
of
bullocks
or
of
lambs
or
of
he
goats
when
ye
come
to
appear
before
me
who
hath
required
this
at
your
hand
to
tread
my
courts
bring
no
more
vain
oblations
incense
is
an
abomination
unto
me
the
new
moons
and
sabbaths
the
calling
of
assemblies
i
cannot
away
with
it
is
iniquity
even
the
solemn
meeting
your
new
moons
and
your
appointed
feasts
my
soul
hateth
they
are
a
trouble
unto
me
i
am
weary
to
bear
them
and
when
ye
spread
forth
your
hands
i
will
hide
mine
eyes
from
you
yea
when
ye
make
many
prayers
i
will
not
hear
your
hands
are
full
of
blood
wash
you
make
you
clean
put
away
the
evil
of
your
doings
from
before
mine
eyes
cease
to
do
evil
learn
to
do
well
seek
judgment
relieve
the
oppressed
judge
the
fatherless
plead
for
the
widow
come
now
and
let
us
reason
together
saith
the
lord
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
like
crimson
they
shall
be
as
wool
if
ye
be
willing
and
obedient
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
but
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel
ye
shall
be
devoured
with
the
sword
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
how
is
the
faithful
city
become
an
harlot
it
was
full
of
judgment
righteousness
lodged
in
it
but
now
murderers
thy
silver
is
become
dross
thy
wine
mixed
with
water
thy
princes
are
rebellious
and
companions
of
thieves
every
one
loveth
gifts
and
followeth
after
rewards
they
judge
not
the
fatherless
neither
doth
the
cause
of
the
widow
come
unto
them
therefore
saith
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
the
mighty
one
of
israel
ah
i
will
ease
me
of
mine
adversaries
and
avenge
me
of
mine
enemies
and
i
will
turn
my
hand
upon
thee
and
purely
purge
away
thy
dross
and
take
away
all
thy
tin
and
i
will
restore
thy
judges
as
at
the
first
and
thy
counsellors
as
at
the
beginning
afterward
thou
shalt
be
called
the
city
of
righteousness
the
faithful
city
zion
shall
be
redeemed
with
judgment
and
her
converts
with
righteousness
and
the
destruction
of
the
transgressors
and
of
the
sinners
shall
be
together
and
they
that
forsake
the
lord
shall
be
consumed
for
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
the
oaks
which
ye
have
desired
and
ye
shall
be
confounded
for
the
gardens
that
ye
have
chosen
for
ye
shall
be
as
an
oak
whose
leaf
fadeth
and
as
a
garden
that
hath
no
water
and
the
strong
shall
be
as
tow
and
the
maker
of
it
as
a
spark
and
they
shall
both
burn
together
and
none
shall
quench
them
the
word
that
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
saw
concerning
judah
and
jerusalem
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
that
the
mountain
of
the
lord's
house
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills
and
all
nations
shall
flow
unto
it
and
many
people
shall
go
and
say
come
ye
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
lord
to
the
house
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
for
out
of
zion
shall
go
forth
the
law
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
and
he
shall
judge
among
the
nations
and
shall
rebuke
many
people
and
they
shall
beat
their
swords
into
plowshares
and
their
spears
into
pruninghooks
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more
o
house
of
jacob
come
ye
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
lord
therefore
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people
the
house
of
jacob
because
they
be
replenished
from
the
east
and
are
soothsayers
like
the
philistines
and
they
please
themselves
in
the
children
of
strangers
their
land
also
is
full
of
silver
and
gold
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
treasures
their
land
is
also
full
of
horses
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
chariots
their
land
also
is
full
of
idols
they
worship
the
work
of
their
own
hands
that
which
their
own
fingers
have
made
and
the
mean
man
boweth
down
and
the
great
man
humbleth
himself
therefore
forgive
them
not
enter
into
the
rock
and
hide
thee
in
the
dust
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty
the
lofty
looks
of
man
shall
be
humbled
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
bowed
down
and
the
lord
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day
for
the
day
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
be
upon
every
one
that
is
proud
and
lofty
and
upon
every
one
that
is
lifted
up
and
he
shall
be
brought
low
and
upon
all
the
cedars
of
lebanon
that
are
high
and
lifted
up
and
upon
all
the
oaks
of
bashan
and
upon
all
the

every
fenced
wall
and
upon
all
the
ships
of
tarshish
and
upon
all
pleasant
pictures
and
the
loftiness
of
man
shall
be
bowed
down
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
made
low
and
the
lord
alone
shall
be
exalted
in
that
day
and
the
idols
he
shall
utterly
abolish
and
they
shall
go
into
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
into
the
caves
of
the
earth
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the
glory
of
his
majesty
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth
in
that
day
a
man
shall
cast
his
idols
of
silver
and
his
idols
of
gold
which
they
made
each
one
for
himself
to
worship
to
the
moles
and
to
the
bats
to
go
into
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
and
into
the
tops
of
the
ragged
rocks
for
fear
of
the
lord
and
for
the

majesty
when

terribly
the
earth
cease
ye
from

whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
for
wherein
is
he
to
be
accounted
of
for
behold
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
doth
take
away
from
jerusalem
and
from
judah
the
stay
and
the
staff
the
whole
stay
of
bread
and
the
whole
stay
of
water
the
mighty
man
and
the
man
of
war
the
judge
and
the
prophet
and
the
prudent
and
the
ancient
the
captain
of
fifty
and
the
honourable
man
and
the
counsellor
and
the
cunning
artificer
and
the
eloquent
orator
and
i
will
give
children
to
be
their
princes
and
babes
shall
rule
over
them
and
the
people
shall
be
oppressed
every
one
by
another
and
every
one
by
his
neighbour
the
child
shall
behave
himself
proudly
against
the
ancient
and
the
base
against
the
honourable
when
a
man
shall
take
hold
of
his
brother
of
the
house
of
his
father
saying
thou
hast
clothing
be
thou
our
ruler
and
let
this
ruin
be
under
thy
hand
in
that
day
shall
he
swear
saying
i
will
not
be
an
healer
for
in
my
house
is
neither
bread
nor
clothing
make
me
not
a
ruler
of
the
people
for
jerusalem
is
ruined
and
judah
is
fallen
because
their
tongue
and
their
doings
are
against
the
lord
to
provoke
the
eyes
of
his
glory
the
shew
of
their
countenance
doth
witness
against
them
and
they
declare
their
sin
as
sodom
they
hide
it
not
woe
unto
their
soul
for
they
have
rewarded
evil
unto
themselves
say
ye
to
the
righteous
that
it
shall
be
well
with
him
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings
woe
unto
the
wicked
it
shall
be
ill
with
him
for
the
reward
of
his
hands
shall
be
given
him
as
for
my
people
children
are
their
oppressors
and
women
rule
over
them
o
my
people
they
which
lead
thee
cause
thee
to
err
and
destroy
the
way
of
thy
paths
the
lord
standeth
up
to
plead
and
standeth
to
judge
the
people
the
lord
will
enter
into
judgment
with
the
ancients
of
his
people
and
the
princes
thereof
for
ye
have
eaten
up
the
vineyard
the
spoil
of
the
poor
is
in
your
houses
what
mean
ye
that
ye
beat
my
people
to
pieces
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
moreover
the
lord
saith
because
the
daughters
of
zion
are
haughty
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet
therefore
the
lord
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
the
lord
will
discover
their
secret
parts
in
that
day
the
lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
earrings
the
rings
and
nose
jewels
the
changeable
suits
of
apparel
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
hoods
and
the
vails
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
instead
of
sweet
smell
there
shall
be
stink
and
instead
of
a
girdle
a
rent
and
instead
of
well
set
hair
baldness
and
instead
of
a
stomacher
a
girding
of
sackcloth
and
burning
instead
of
beauty
thy
men
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
mighty
in
the
war
and
her
gates
shall
lament
and
mourn
and
she
being
desolate
shall
sit
upon
the
ground
and
in
that
day
seven
women
shall
take
hold
of
one
man
saying
we
will
eat
our
own
bread
and
wear
our
own
apparel
only
let
us
be
called
by
thy
name
to
take
away
our
reproach
in
that
day
shall
the
branch
of
the
lord
be
beautiful
and
glorious
and
the
fruit
of
the
earth
shall
be
excellent
and
comely
for
them
that
are
escaped
of
israel
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
he
that
is
left
in
zion
and
he
that
remaineth
in
jerusalem
shall
be
called
holy
even
every
one
that
is
written
among
the
living
in
jerusalem
when
the
lord
shall
have
washed
away
the
filth
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
shall
have
purged
the
blood
of
jerusalem
from
the
midst
thereof
by
the
spirit
of
judgment
and
by
the
spirit
of
burning
and
the
lord
will
create
upon
every
dwelling
place
of
mount
zion
and
upon
her
assemblies
a
cloud
and
smoke
by
day
and
the
shining
of
a
flaming
fire
by
night
for
upon
all
the
glory
shall
be
a
defence
and
there
shall
be
a
tabernacle
for
a
shadow
in
the
day
time
from
the
heat
and
for
a
place
of
refuge
and
for
a
covert
from
storm
and
from
rain
now
will
i
sing
to
my
wellbeloved
a
song
of
my
beloved
touching
his
vineyard
my
wellbeloved
hath
a
vineyard
in
a
very
fruitful
hill
and
he
fenced
it
and
gathered
out
the
stones
thereof
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine
and
built
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
it
and
also
made
a
winepress
therein
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
and
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes
and
now
o
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
men
of
judah
judge
i
pray
you
betwixt
me
and
my
vineyard
what
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard
that
i
have
not
done
in
it
wherefore
when
i
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
brought
it
forth
wild
grapes
and
now
go
to
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
to
my
vineyard
i
will
take
away
the
hedge
thereof
and
it
shall
be
eaten
up
and
break
down
the
wall
thereof
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down
and
i
will
lay
it
waste
it
shall
not
be
pruned
nor
digged
but
there
shall
come
up
briers
and
thorns
i
will
also
command
the
clouds
that
they
rain
no
rain
upon
it
for
the
vineyard
of
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
house
of
israel
and
the
men
of
judah
his
pleasant
plant
and
he
looked
for
judgment
but
behold
oppression
for
righteousness
but
behold
a
cry
woe
unto
them
that
join
house
to
house
that
lay
field
to
field
till
there
be
no
place
that
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
in
mine
ears
said
the
lord
of
hosts
of
a
truth
many
houses
shall
be
desolate
even
great
and
fair
without
inhabitant
yea
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
one
bath
and
the
seed
of
an
homer
shall
yield
an
ephah
woe
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
that
continue
until
night
till
wine
inflame
them
and
the
harp
and
the
viol
the
tabret
and
pipe
and
wine
are
in
their
feasts
but
they
regard
not
the
work
of
the
lord
neither
consider
the
operation
of
his
hands
therefore
my
people
are
gone
into
captivity
because
they
have
no
knowledge
and
their
honourable
men
are
famished
and
their
multitude
dried
up
with
thirst
therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure
and
their
glory
and
their
multitude
and
their
pomp
and
he
that
rejoiceth
shall
descend
into
it
and
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall
be
humbled
but
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment
and
god
that
is
holy
shall
be
sanctified
in
righteousness
then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
their
manner
and
the
waste
places
of
the
fat
ones
shall
strangers
eat
woe
unto
them
that
draw
iniquity
with
cords
of
vanity
and
sin
as
it
were
with
a
cart
rope
that
say
let
him
make
speed
and
hasten
his
work
that
we
may
see
it
and
let
the
counsel
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
draw
nigh
and
come
that
we
may
know
it
woe
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
that
put
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
that
put
bitter
for
sweet
and
sweet
for
bitter
woe
unto
them
that
are
wise
in
their
own
eyes
and
prudent
in
their
own
sight
woe
unto
them
that
are
mighty
to
drink
wine
and
men
of
strength
to
mingle
strong
drink
which
justify
the
wicked
for
reward
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him
therefore
as
the
fire
devoureth
the
stubble
and
the
flame
consumeth
the
chaff
so
their
root
shall
be
as
rottenness
and
their
blossom
shall
go
up
as
dust
because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
despised
the
word
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
therefore
is
the
anger
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his
hand
against
them
and
hath
smitten
them
and
the
hills
did
tremble
and
their
carcases
were
torn
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
and
he
will
lift
up
an
ensign
to
the
nations
from
far
and
will
hiss
unto
them
from
the
end
of
the
earth
and
behold
they
shall
come
with
speed
swiftly
none
shall
be
weary
nor
stumble
among
them
none
shall
slumber
nor
sleep
neither
shall
the
girdle
of
their
loins
be
loosed
nor
the
latchet
of
their
shoes
be
broken
whose
arrows
are
sharp
and
all
their
bows
bent
their
horses
hoofs
shall
be
counted
like
flint
and
their
wheels
like
a
whirlwind
their
roaring
shall
be
like
a
lion
they
shall
roar
like
young
lions
yea
they
shall
roar
and
lay
hold
of
the
prey
and
shall
carry
it
away
safe
and
none
shall
deliver
it
and
in
that
day
they
shall
roar
against
them
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
if
one
look
unto
the
land
behold
darkness
and
sorrow
and
the
light
is
darkened
in
the
heavens
thereof
in
the
year
that
king
uzziah
died
i
saw
also
the
lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
high
and
lifted
up
and
his
train
filled
the
temple
above
it
stood
the
seraphims
each
one
had
six
wings
with
twain
he
covered
his
face
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
and
with
twain
he
did
fly
and
one
cried
unto
another
and
said
holy
holy
holy
is
the
lord
of
hosts
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory
and
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
then
said
i
woe
is
me
for
i
am
undone
because
i
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips
and
i
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts
then
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me
having
a
live
coal
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar
and
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth
and
said
lo
this
hath
touched
thy
lips
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
and
thy
sin
purged
also
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
whom
shall
i
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
then
said
i
here
am
i
send
me
and
he
said
go
and
tell
this
people
hear
ye
indeed
but
understand
not
and
see
ye
indeed
but
perceive
not
make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat
and
make
their
ears
heavy
and
shut
their
eyes
lest
they
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
convert
and
be
healed
then
said
i
lord
how
long
and
he
answered
until
the
cities
be
wasted
without
inhabitant
and
the
houses
without
man
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate
and
the
lord
have
removed
men
far
away
and
there
be
a
great
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
land
but
yet
in
it
shall
be
a
tenth
and
it
shall
return
and
shall
be
eaten
as
a
teil
tree
and
as
an
oak
whose
substance
is
in
them
when
they
cast
their
leaves
so
the
holy
seed
shall
be
the
substance
thereof
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
ahaz
the
son
of
jotham
the
son
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
that
rezin
the
king
of
syria
and
pekah
the
son
of
remaliah
king
of
israel
went
up
toward
jerusalem
to
war
against
it
but
could
not
prevail
against
it
and
it
was
told
the
house
of
david
saying
syria
is
confederate
with
ephraim
and
his
heart
was
moved
and
the
heart
of
his
people
as
the
trees
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind
then
said
the
lord
unto
isaiah
go
forth
now
to
meet
ahaz
thou
and
shearjashub
thy
son
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field
and
say
unto
him
take
heed
and
be
quiet
fear
not
neither
be
fainthearted
for
the
two
tails
of
these
smoking
firebrands
for
the
fierce
anger
of
rezin
with
syria
and
of
the
son
of
remaliah
because
syria
ephraim
and
the
son
of
remaliah
have
taken
evil
counsel
against
thee
saying
let
us
go
up
against
judah
and
vex
it
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it
even
the
son
of
tabeal
thus
saith
the
lord
god
it
shall
not
stand
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass
for
the
head
of
syria
is
damascus
and
the
head
of
damascus
is
rezin
and
within
threescore
and
five
years
shall
ephraim
be
broken
that
it
be
not
a
people
and
the
head
of
ephraim
is
samaria
and
the
head
of
samaria
is
remaliah's
son
if
ye
will
not
believe
surely
ye
shall
not
be
established
moreover
the
lord
spake
again
unto
ahaz
saying
ask
thee
a
sign
of
the
lord
thy
god
ask
it
either
in
the
depth
or
in
the
height
above
but
ahaz
said
i
will
not
ask
neither
will
i
tempt
the
lord
and
he
said
hear
ye
now
o
house
of
david
is
it
a
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men
but
will
ye
weary
my
god
also
therefore
the
lord
himself
shall
give
you
a
sign
behold
a
virgin
shall
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
shall
call
his
name
immanuel
butter
and
honey
shall
he
eat
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
for
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
forsaken
of
both
her
kings
the
lord
shall
bring
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
father's
house
days
that
have
not
come
from
the
day
that
ephraim
departed
from
judah
even
the
king
of
assyria
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
hiss
for
the
fly
that
is
in
the
uttermost
part
of
the
rivers
of
egypt
and
for
the
bee
that
is
in
the
land
of
assyria
and
they
shall
come
and
shall
rest
all
of
them
in
the
desolate
valleys
and
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
upon
all
thorns
and
upon
all
bushes
in
the
same
day
shall
the
lord
shave
with
a
razor
that
is
hired
namely
by
them
beyond
the
river
by
the
king
of
assyria
the
head
and
the
hair
of
the
feet
and
it
shall
also
consume
the
beard
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
a
man
shall
nourish
a
young
cow
and
two
sheep
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
for
the
abundance
of
milk
that
they
shall
give
he
shall
eat
butter
for
butter
and
honey
shall
every
one
eat
that
is
left
in
the
land
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
every
place
shall
be
where
there
were
a
thousand
vines
at
a
thousand
silverlings
it
shall
even
be
for
briers
and
thorns
with
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
thither
because
all
the
land
shall
become
briers
and
thorns
and
on
all
hills
that
shall
be
digged
with
the
mattock
there
shall
not
come
thither
the
fear
of
briers
and
thorns
but
it
shall
be
for
the
sending
forth
of
oxen
and
for
the
treading
of
lesser
cattle
moreover
the
lord
said
unto
me
take
thee
a
great
roll
and
write
in
it
with
a
man's
pen
concerning
mahershalalhashbaz
and
i
took
unto
me
faithful
witnesses
to
record
uriah
the
priest
and
zechariah
the
son
of
jeberechiah
and
i
went
unto
the
prophetess
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
then
said
the
lord
to
me
call
his
name
mahershalalhashbaz
for
before
the
child
shall
have
knowledge
to
cry
my
father
and
my
mother
the
riches
of
damascus
and
the
spoil
of
samaria
shall
be
taken
away
before
the
king
of
assyria
the
lord
spake
also
unto
me
again
saying
forasmuch
as
this
people
refuseth
the
waters
of
shiloah
that
go
softly
and
rejoice
in
rezin
and
remaliah's
son
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
bringeth
up
upon
them
the
waters
of
the
river
strong
and
many
even
the
king
of
assyria
and
all
his
glory
and
he
shall
come
up
over
all
his
channels
and
go
over
all
his
banks
and
he
shall
pass
through
judah
he
shall
overflow
and
go
over
he
shall
reach
even
to
the
neck
and
the
stretching
out
of
his
wings
shall
fill
the
breadth
of
thy
land
o
immanuel
associate
yourselves
o
ye
people
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
and
give
ear
all
ye
of
far
countries
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
take
counsel
together
and
it
shall
come
to
nought
speak
the
word
and
it
shall
not
stand
for
god
is
with
us
for
the
lord
spake
thus
to
me
with
a
strong
hand
and
instructed
me
that
i
should
not
walk
in
the
way
of
this
people
saying
say
ye
not
a
confederacy
to
all
them
to
whom
this
people
shall
say
a
confederacy
neither
fear
ye
their
fear
nor
be
afraid
sanctify
the
lord
of
hosts
himself
and
let
him
be
your
fear
and
let
him
be
your
dread
and
he
shall
be
for
a
sanctuary
but
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
offence
to
both
the
houses
of
israel
for
a
gin
and
for
a
snare
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
many
among
them
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
be
broken
and
be
snared
and
be
taken
bind
up
the
testimony
seal
the
law
among
my
disciples
and
i
will
wait
upon
the
lord
that
hideth
his
face
from
the
house
of
jacob
and
i
will
look
for
him
behold
i
and
the
children
whom
the
lord
hath
given
me
are
for
signs
and
for
wonders
in
israel
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
dwelleth
in
mount
zion
and
when
they
shall
say
unto
you
seek
unto
them
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
unto
wizards
that
peep
and
that
mutter
should
not
a
people
seek
unto
their
god
for
the
living
to
the
dead
to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word
it
is
because
there
is
no
light
in
them
and
they
shall
pass
through
it
hardly
bestead
and
hungry
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
be
hungry
they
shall
fret
themselves
and
curse
their
king
and
their
god
and
look
upward
and
they
shall
look
unto
the
earth
and
behold
trouble
and
darkness
dimness
of
anguish
and
they
shall
be
driven
to
darkness
nevertheless
the
dimness
shall
not
be
such
as
was
in
her
vexation
when
at
the
first
he
lightly
afflicted
the
land
of
zebulun
and
the
land
of
naphtali
and
afterward
did
more
grievously
afflict
her
by
the
way
of
the
sea
beyond
jordan
in
galilee
of
the
nations
the
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined
thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation
and
not
increased
the
joy
they
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest
and
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
spoil
for
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder
the
rod
of
his
oppressor
as
in
the
day
of
midian
for
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
fuel
of
fire
for
unto
us
a
child
is
born
unto
us
a
son
is
given
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
name
shall
be
called
wonderful
counsellor
the
mighty
god
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace
of
the
increase
of
his
government
and
peace
there
shall
be
no
end
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
upon
his
kingdom
to
order
it
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
for
ever
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
will
perform
this
the
lord
sent
a
word
into
jacob
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
israel
and
all
the
people
shall
know
even
ephraim
and
the
inhabitant
of
samaria
that
say
in
the
pride
and
stoutness
of
heart
the
bricks
are
fallen
down
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones
the
sycomores
are
cut
down
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars
therefore
the
lord
shall
set
up
the
adversaries
of
rezin
against
him
and
join
his
enemies
together
the
syrians
before
and
the
philistines
behind
and
they
shall
devour
israel
with
open
mouth
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
for
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them
neither
do
they
seek
the
lord
of
hosts
therefore
the
lord
will
cut
off
from
israel
head
and
tail
branch
and
rush
in
one
day
the
ancient
and
honourable
he
is
the
head
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies
he
is
the
tail
for
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
to
err
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed
therefore
the
lord
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men
neither
shall
have
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows
for
every
one
is
an
hypocrite
and
an
evildoer
and
every
mouth
speaketh
folly
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
for
wickedness
burneth
as
the
fire
it
shall
devour
the
briers
and
thorns
and
shall
kindle
in
the
thickets
of
the
forest
and
they
shall
mount
up
like
the
lifting
up
of
smoke
through
the
wrath
of
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
land
darkened
and
the
people
shall
be
as
the
fuel
of
the
fire
no
man
shall
spare
his
brother
and
he
shall
snatch
on
the
right
hand
and
be
hungry
and
he
shall
eat
on
the
left
hand
and
they
shall
not
be
satisfied
they
shall
eat
every
man
the
flesh
of
his
own
arm
manasseh
ephraim
and
ephraim
manasseh
and
they
together
shall
be
against
judah
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
woe
unto
them
that
decree
unrighteous
decrees
and
that
write
grievousness
which
they
have
prescribed
to
turn
aside
the
needy
from
judgment
and
to
take
away
the
right
from
the
poor
of
my
people
that
widows
may
be
their
prey
and
that
they
may
rob
the
fatherless
and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
day
of
visitation
and
in
the
desolation
which
shall
come
from
far
to
whom
will
ye
flee
for
help
and
where
will
ye
leave
your
glory
without
me
they
shall
bow
down
under
the
prisoners
and
they
shall
fall
under
the
slain
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
o
assyrian
the
rod
of
mine
anger
and
the
staff
in
their
hand
is
mine
indignation
i
will
send
him
against
an
hypocritical
nation
and
against
the
people
of
my
wrath
will
i
give
him
a
charge
to
take
the
spoil
and
to
take
the
prey
and
to
tread
them
down
like
the
mire
of
the
streets
howbeit
he
meaneth
not
so
neither
doth
his
heart
think
so
but
it
is
in
his
heart
to
destroy
and
cut
off
nations
not
a
few
for
he
saith
are
not
my
princes
altogether
kings
is
not
calno
as
carchemish
is
not
hamath
as
arpad
is
not
samaria
as
damascus
as
my
hand
hath
found
the
kingdoms
of
the
idols
and
whose
graven
images
did
excel
them
of
jerusalem
and
of
samaria
shall
i
not
as
i
have
done
unto
samaria
and
her
idols
so
do
to
jerusalem
and
her
idols
wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
zion
and
on
jerusalem
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
for
he
saith
by
the
strength
of
my
hand
i
have
done
it
and
by
my
wisdom
for
i
am
prudent
and
i
have
removed
the
bounds
of
the
people
and
have
robbed
their
treasures
and
i
have
put
down
the
inhabitants
like
a
valiant
man
and
my
hand
hath
found
as
a
nest
the
riches
of
the
people
and
as
one
gathereth
eggs
that
are
left
have
i
gathered
all
the
earth
and
there
was
none
that
moved
the
wing
or
opened
the
mouth
or
peeped
shall
the
axe
boast
itself
against
him
that
heweth
therewith
or
shall
the
saw
magnify
itself
against
him
that
shaketh
it
as
if
the
rod
should
shake
itself
against
them
that
lift
it
up
or
as
if
the
staff
should
lift
up
itself
as
if
it
were
no
wood
therefore
shall
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
send
among
his
fat
ones
leanness
and
under
his
glory
he
shall
kindle
a
burning
like
the
burning
of
a
fire
and
the
light
of
israel
shall
be
for
a
fire
and
his
holy
one
for
a
flame
and
it
shall
burn
and
devour
his
thorns
and
his
briers
in
one
day
and
shall
consume
the
glory
of
his
forest
and
of
his
fruitful
field
both
soul
and
body
and
they
shall
be
as
when
a
standard-bearer
fainteth
and
the
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forest
shall
be
few
that
a
child
may
write
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
remnant
of
israel
and
such
as
are
escaped
of
the
house
of
jacob
shall
no
more
again
stay
upon
him
that
smote
them
but
shall
stay
upon
the
lord
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
truth
the
remnant
shall
return
even
the
remnant
of
jacob
unto
the
mighty
god
for
though
thy
people
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
yet
a
remnant
of
them
shall
return
the
consumption
decreed
shall
overflow
with
righteousness
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
shall
make
a
consumption
even
determined
in
the
midst
of
all
the
land
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
o
my
people
that
dwellest
in
zion
be
not
afraid
of
the
assyrian
he
shall
smite
thee
with
a
rod
and
shall
lift
up
his
staff
against
thee
after
the
manner
of
egypt
for
yet
a
very
little
while
and
the
indignation
shall
cease
and
mine
anger
in
their
destruction
and
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
stir
up
a
scourge
for
him
according
to
the
slaughter
of
midian
at
the
rock
of
oreb
and
as
his
rod
was
upon
the
sea
so
shall
he
lift
it
up
after
the
manner
of
egypt
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
his
burden
shall
be
taken
away
from
off
thy
shoulder
and
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
and
the
yoke
shall
be
destroyed
because
of
the
anointing

the
inhabitants
of

themselves
to

shall
he
remain
at
nob
that
day
he
shall
shake
his
hand
against
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
zion
the
hill
of
jerusalem
behold
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
lop
the
bough
with
terror
and
the
high
ones
of
stature
shall
be
hewn
down
and
the
haughty
shall
be
humbled
and
he
shall
cut
down
the
thickets
of
the
forest
with
iron
and
lebanon
shall
fall
by
a
mighty
one
and
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
jesse
and
a
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
him
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
shall
make
him
of
quick
understanding
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes
neither
reprove
after
the
hearing
of
his
ears
but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
and
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
the
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
a
little
child
shall

put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice
den

not
hurt
nor

in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
and
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
which
shall
stand
for
an
ensign
of
the
people
to
it
shall
the
gentiles
seek
and
his
rest
shall
be
glorious
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left

up
an
ensign
for
the
nations

assemble
the
outcasts
of
israel
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
the
envy
also
of
ephraim

adversaries
of
judah
shall
be
cut
off
ephraim
shall
not
envy
judah
and
judah
shall
not
vex
ephraim
but
they
shall
fly
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
philistines
toward
the
west
they
shall
spoil
them
of
the
east
together
they
shall
lay
their
hand
upon
edom
and
moab
and
the
children
of
ammon
shall
obey
them
and
the
lord
shall
utterly
destroy
the
tongue
of
the
egyptian
sea
and
with
his
mighty
wind
shall
he
shake
his
hand
over
the
river
and
shall
smite
it
in
the
seven
streams
and
make
men
go
over
dryshod
and
there
shall
be
an
highway
for
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left
from
assyria
like
as
it
was
to
israel
in
the
day
that
he
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
in
that
day
thou
shalt
say

the
noise

a
tumultuous
noise
of
the
kingdoms
of

the
arabian
pitch

there
neither

there
and
their
houses

be
full
of
doleful
creatures
and
owls
shall
dwell
there
and
satyrs

dance
there
and
the
wild
beasts
of

desolate
houses
and
dragons
in
their
pleasant
palaces
and
her
time
is
near
to
come
and
her
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
for
the
lord
will
have
mercy
on
jacob
and
will
yet
choose
israel
and
set
them
in
their
own
land
and
the
strangers
shall
be
joined

and
they
shall
cleave
to
the
house
of
jacob
and
the
people
shall
take
them
and
bring
them
to
their
place
and
the
house
of
israel
shall
possess
them
in
the
land
of
the
lord
for
servants
and
handmaids
and
they
shall
take
them
captives
whose
captives
they
were
and
they
shall
rule
over
their
oppressors
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
day
that
the
lord
shall
give
thee
rest
from
thy
sorrow
and
from
thy
fear
and
from
the
hard
bondage
wherein
thou
wast
made
to
serve
that
thou
shalt
take
up
this
proverb
against
the
king
of
babylon
and
say
how
hath
the
oppressor
ceased
the
golden
city
ceased
the
lord
hath
broken
the
staff
of
the
wicked
and
the
sceptre
of
the
rulers
he
who
smote
the
people
in
wrath
with
a
continual
stroke
he
that
ruled
the
nations
in
anger
is
persecuted
and
none
hindereth
the
whole
earth
is
at
rest
and
is
quiet
they
break
forth
into
singing
yea
the
fir
trees
rejoice
at
thee
and
the
cedars
of
lebanon
saying
since
thou
art
laid
down
no
feller
is
come
up
against
us
hell
from
beneath
is
moved
for
thee
to
meet
thee
at
thy
coming
it
stirreth
up
the
dead
for
thee
even
all
the
chief
ones
of
the
earth
it
hath
raised
up
from
their
thrones
all
the
kings
of
the
nations
all
they
shall
speak
and
say
unto
thee
art
thou
also
become
weak
as
we
art
thou
become
like
unto
us
thy
pomp
is
brought
down
to
the
grave
and
the
noise
of
thy
viols
the
worm
is
spread
under
thee
and
the
worms
cover
thee
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
how
art
thou
cut
down
to
the
ground
which
didst
weaken
the
nations
for
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart
i
will
ascend
into
heaven
i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
i
will
sit
also
upon
the
mount
of
the
congregation
in
the
sides
of
the
north
i
will
ascend
above
the
heights
of
the
clouds
i
will
be
like
the
most
high
yet
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hell
to
the
sides
of
the
pit
they
that
see
thee
shall
narrowly
look
upon
thee
and
consider
thee
saying
is
this
the
man
that
made
the
earth
to
tremble
that
did
shake
kingdoms
that
made
the
world
as
a
wilderness
and
destroyed
the
cities
thereof
that
opened
not
the
house
of
his
prisoners
all
the
kings
of
the
nations
even
all
of
them
lie
in
glory
every
one
in
his
own
house
but
thou
art
cast
out
of
thy
grave
like
an
abominable
branch
and
as
the
raiment
of
those
that
are
slain
thrust
through
with
a
sword
that
go
down
to
the
stones
of
the
pit
as
a
carcase
trodden
under
feet
thou
shalt
not
be
joined
with
them
in
burial
because
thou
hast
destroyed
thy
land
and
slain
thy
people
the
seed
of
evildoers
shall
never
be
renowned
prepare
slaughter
for
his
children
for
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
that
they
do
not
rise
nor
possess
the
land
nor
fill
the
face
of
the
world

it
stand
that
i

for
there
shall
come
from
the
north
a
smoke
and
none
shall
be

in
his
appointed
times
what
shall
one
then
answer
the
messengers
of
the
nation
that
the
lord
hath
founded
zion
and
the
poor
of
his
people
shall
trust
in
it
the
burden
of
moab
because
in
the
night
ar
of
moab
is
laid

and
brought
to

because
in
the
night
kir
of
moab
is
laid
waste
and
brought
to

he
is
gone
up
to
bajith
and
to

every
one
shall
howl
weeping
abundantly
and
heshbon
shall
cry
and
elealeh
their
voice
shall
be
heard
even
unto
jahaz
therefore
the
armed
soldiers
of
moab
shall
cry
out
his
life
shall
be
grievous
unto
him
my
heart
shall
cry
out
for
moab
his
fugitives
shall
flee
unto
zoar
an
heifer
of
three
years
old
for
by
the
mounting
up
of
luhith
with
weeping
shall
they
go
it
up
for
in
the
way
of
horonaim
they
shall
raise
up
a
cry
of
destruction
for
the
waters
of
nimrim
shall
be
desolate
for
the
hay
is
withered
away
the
grass
faileth
there
is
no
green
thing
therefore
the
abundance
they
have
gotten
and
that
which
they
have
laid
up
shall
they
carry
away
to
the
brook
of
the
willows
for
the
cry
is
gone
round
about
the
borders
of
moab
the
howling
thereof
unto
eglaim
and
the
howling
thereof
unto
beerelim
for
the
waters
of
dimon
shall
be
full
of
blood
for
i
will
bring
more
upon
dimon
lions
upon
him
that
escapeth
of
moab
and
upon
the
remnant
of
the
land
send
ye
the
lamb
to
the
ruler
of
the
land
from
sela
to
the
wilderness
unto
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
zion
for
it
shall
be
that
as
a
wandering
bird
cast
out
of
the
nest
so
the
daughters
of
moab
shall
be
at
the
fords
of
arnon
take
counsel
execute
judgment
make
thy
shadow
as
the
night
in
the
midst
of
the
noonday
hide
the
outcasts
bewray
not
him
that
wandereth
let
mine
outcasts
dwell
with
thee
moab
be
thou
a
covert
to
them
from
the
face
of
the
spoiler
for
the
extortioner
is
at
an
end
the
spoiler
ceaseth
the
oppressors
are
consumed
out
of
the
land
and
in
mercy
shall
the
throne
be
established
and
he
shall
sit
upon
it
in
truth
in
the
tabernacle
of
david
judging
and
seeking
judgment
and
hasting
righteousness
we
have
heard
of
the
pride
of
moab
he
is
very
proud
even
of
his
haughtiness
and
his
pride
and
his
wrath
but
his
lies
shall
not
be
so
therefore
shall
moab
howl
for
moab
every
one
shall
howl
for
the
foundations
of
kirhareseth
shall
ye
mourn
surely
they
are
stricken
for
the
fields
of
heshbon
languish
and
the
vine
of
sibmah
the
lords
of
the
heathen
have
broken
down
the
principal
plants
thereof
they
are
come
even
unto
jazer
they
wandered
through
the
wilderness
her
branches
are
stretched
out
they
are
gone
over
the
sea
therefore
i
will
bewail
with
the
weeping
of
jazer
the
vine
of
sibmah
i
will
water
thee
with
my
tears
o
heshbon
and
elealeh
for
the
shouting
for
thy
summer
fruits
and
for
thy
harvest
is
fallen
and
gladness
is
taken
away
and
joy
out
of
the
plentiful
field
and
in
the
vineyards
there
shall
be
no
singing
neither
shall
there
be
shouting
the
treaders
shall
tread
out
no
wine
in
their
presses
i
have
made
their
vintage
shouting
to
cease
wherefore
my
bowels
shall
sound
like
an
harp
for
moab
and
mine
inward
parts
for
kirharesh
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
it
is
seen
that
moab
is
weary
on
the
high
place
that
he
shall
come
to
his
sanctuary
to
pray
but
he
shall
not
prevail
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
moab
since
that
time
but
now
the
lord
hath
spoken
saying
within
three
years
as
the
years
of
an
hireling
and
the
glory
of
moab
shall
be
contemned
with
all
that
great
multitude
and
the
remnant
shall
be
very
small
and
feeble
the
burden
of
damascus
behold
damascus
is
taken
away
from
being
a
city
and
it
shall
be
a
ruinous
heap
the
cities
of
aroer
are
forsaken
they
shall
be
for
flocks
which
shall
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
them
afraid
the
fortress
also
shall
cease
from
ephraim
and
the
kingdom
from
damascus
and
the
remnant
of
syria
they
shall
be
as
the
glory
of
the
children
of
israel
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
in
that
day
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
glory
of
jacob
shall
be
made
thin
and
the
fatness
of
his
flesh
shall
wax
lean
and
it
shall
be
as
when
the
harvestman
gathereth
the
corn
and
reapeth
the
ears
with
his
arm
and
it
shall
be
as
he
that
gathereth
ears
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
yet
gleaning
grapes
shall
be
left
in
it
as
the
shaking
of
an
olive
tree
two
or
three
berries
in
the
top
of
the
uppermost
bough
four
or
five
in
the
outmost
fruitful
branches
thereof
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
at
that
day
shall
a
man
look
to
his
maker
and
his
eyes
shall
have
respect
to
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
he
shall
not
look
to
the
altars
the
work
of
his
hands
neither
shall
respect
that
which
his
fingers
have
made
either
the
groves
or
the
images
in
that
day
shall
his
strong
cities
be
as
a
forsaken
bough
and
an
uppermost
branch
which
they
left
because
of
the
children
of
israel
and
there
shall
be
desolation
because
thou
hast
forgotten
the
god
of
thy
salvation
and
hast
not
been
mindful
of
the
rock
of
thy
strength
therefore
shalt
thou
plant
pleasant
plants
and
shalt
set
it
with
strange
slips
in
the
day
shalt
thou
make
thy
plant
to
grow
and
in
the
morning
shalt
thou
make
thy
seed
to
flourish
but
the
harvest
shall
be
a
heap
in
the
day
of
grief
and
of
desperate
sorrow
woe
to
the
multitude
of
many
people
which
make
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
the
seas
and
to
the
rushing
of
nations
that
make
a
rushing
like
the
rushing
of
mighty
waters
the
nations
shall
rush
like
the
rushing
of
many
waters
but
god
shall
rebuke
them
and
they
shall
flee
far
off
and
shall
be
chased
as
the
chaff
of
the
mountains
before
the
wind
and
like
a
rolling
thing
before
the
whirlwind
and
behold
at
eveningtide
trouble
and
before
the
morning
he
is
not
this
is
the
portion
of
them
that
spoil
us
and
the
lot
of
them
that
rob
us
woe
to
the
land
shadowing
with
wings
which
is
beyond
the
rivers
of
ethiopia
that
sendeth
ambassadors
by
the
sea
even
in
vessels
of
bulrushes
upon
the
waters
saying
go
ye
swift
messengers
to
a
nation
scattered
and
peeled
to
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
down
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled
all
ye
inhabitants
of
the
world
and
dwellers
on
the
earth
see
ye
when
he
lifteth
up
an
ensign
on
the
mountains
and
when
he
bloweth
a
trumpet
hear
ye
for
so
the
lord
said
unto
me
i
will
take
my
rest
and
i
will
consider
in
my
dwelling
place
like
a
clear
heat
upon
herbs
and
like
a
cloud
of
dew
in
the
heat
of
harvest
for
afore
the
harvest
when
the
bud
is
perfect
and
the
sour
grape
is
ripening
in
the
flower
he
shall
both
cut
off
the
sprigs
with
pruning
hooks
and
take
away
and
cut
down
the
branches
they
shall
be
left
together
unto
the
fowls
of
the
mountains
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
the
fowls
shall
summer
upon
them
and
all
the
beasts
of
the
earth
shall
winter
upon
them
in
that
time
shall
the
present
be
brought
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
of
a
people
scattered
and
peeled
and
from
a
people
terrible
from
their
beginning
hitherto
a
nation
meted
out
and
trodden
under
foot
whose
land
the
rivers
have
spoiled
to
the
place
of
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
mount
zion
the
burden
of
egypt
behold
the
lord
rideth
upon
a
swift
cloud
and
shall
come
into
egypt
and
the
idols
of
egypt
shall
be
moved
at
his
presence
and
the
heart
of
egypt
shall
melt
in
the
midst
of
it
and
i
will
set
the
egyptians
against
the
egyptians
and
they
shall
fight
every
one
against
his
brother
and
every
one
against
his
neighbour
city
against
city
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
the
spirit
of
egypt
shall
fail
in
the
midst
thereof
and
i
will
destroy
the
counsel
thereof
and
they
shall
seek
to
the
idols
and
to
the
charmers
and
to
them
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
to
the
wizards
and
the
egyptians
will
i
give
over
into
the
hand
of
a
cruel
lord
and
a
fierce
king
shall
rule
over
them
saith
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
and
the
waters
shall
fail
from
the
sea
and
the
river
shall
be
wasted
and
dried
up
and
they
shall
turn
the
rivers
far
away
and
the
brooks
of
defence
shall
be
emptied
and
dried
up
the
reeds
and
flags
shall
wither
the
paper
reeds
by
the
brooks
by
the
mouth
of
the
brooks
and
every
thing
sown
by
the
brooks
shall
wither
be
driven
away
and
be
no
more
the
fishers
also
shall
mourn
and
all
they
that
cast
angle
into
the
brooks
shall
lament
and
they
that
spread
nets
upon
the
waters
shall
languish
moreover
they
that
work
in
fine
flax
and
they
that
weave
networks
shall
be
confounded
and
they
shall
be
broken
in
the
purposes
thereof
all
that
make
sluices
and
ponds
for
fish
surely
the
princes
of
zoan
are
fools
the
counsel
of
the
wise
counsellors
of
pharaoh
is
become
brutish
how
say
ye
unto
pharaoh
i
am
the
son
of
the
wise
the
son
of
ancient
kings
where
are
they
where
are
thy
wise
men
and
let
them
tell
thee
now
and
let
them
know
what
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
upon
egypt
the
princes
of
zoan
are
become
fools
the
princes
of
noph
are
deceived
they
have
also
seduced
egypt
even
they
that
are
the
stay
of
the
tribes
thereof
the
lord
hath
mingled
a
perverse
spirit
in
the
midst
thereof
and
they
have
caused
egypt
to
err
in
every
work
thereof
as
a
drunken
man
staggereth
in
his
vomit
neither
shall
there
be
any
work
for
egypt
which
the
head
or
tail
branch
or
rush
may
do
in
that
day
shall
egypt
be
like
unto
women
and
it
shall
be
afraid
and
fear
because
of
the
shaking
of
the
hand
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
he
shaketh
over
it
and
the
land
of
judah
shall
be
a
terror
unto
egypt
every
one
that
maketh
mention
thereof
shall
be
afraid
in
himself
because
of
the
counsel
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
he
hath
determined
against
it
in
that
day
shall
five
cities
in
the
land
of
egypt
speak
the
language
of
canaan
and
swear
to
the
lord
of
hosts
one
shall
be
called
the
city
of
destruction
in
that
day
shall
there
be
an
altar
to
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
a
pillar
at
the
border
thereof
to
the
lord
and
it
shall
be
for
a
sign
and
for
a
witness
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
in
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
shall
cry
unto
the
lord
because
of
the
oppressors
and
he
shall
send
them
a
saviour
and
a
great
one
and
he
shall
deliver
them
and
the
lord
shall
be
known
to
egypt
and
the
egyptians
shall
know
the
lord
in
that
day
and
shall
do
sacrifice
and
oblation
yea
they
shall
vow
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
perform
it
and
the
lord
shall
smite
egypt
he
shall
smite
and
heal
it
and
they
shall
return
even
to
the
lord
and
he
shall
be
intreated
of
them
and
shall
heal
them
in
that
day
shall
there
be
a
highway
out
of
egypt
to
assyria
and
the
assyrian
shall
come
into
egypt
and
the
egyptian
into
assyria
and
the
egyptians
shall
serve
with
the
assyrians
in
that
day
shall
israel
be
the
third
with
egypt
and
with
assyria
even
a
blessing
in
the
midst
of
the
land
whom
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
bless
saying
blessed
be
egypt
my
people
and
assyria
the
work
of
my
hands
and
israel
mine
inheritance
in
the
year
that
tartan
came
unto
ashdod
when
sargon
the
king
of
assyria
sent
him
and
fought
against
ashdod
and
took
it
at
the
same
time
spake
the
lord
by
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
saying
go
and
loose
the
sackcloth
from
off
thy
loins
and
put
off
thy
shoe
from
thy
foot
and
he
did
so
walking
naked
and
barefoot
and
the
lord
said
like
as
my
servant
isaiah
hath
walked
naked
and
barefoot
three
years
for
a
sign
and
wonder
upon
egypt
and
upon
ethiopia
so
shall
the
king
of
assyria
lead
away
the
egyptians
prisoners
and
the
ethiopians
captives
young
and
old
naked
and
barefoot
even
with
their
buttocks
uncovered
to
the
shame
of
egypt
and
they
shall
be
afraid
and
ashamed
of
ethiopia
their
expectation
and
of
egypt
their
glory
and
the
inhabitant
of
this
isle
shall
say
in
that
day
behold
such
is
our
expectation
whither
we
flee
for
help
to
be
delivered
from
the
king
of
assyria
and
how
shall
we
escape
the
burden
of
the
desert
of
the
sea
as
whirlwinds
in
the
south
pass
through
so
it
cometh
from
the
desert
from
a
terrible
land
a
grievous
vision
is
declared
unto
me
the
treacherous
dealer
dealeth
treacherously
and
the
spoiler
spoileth
go
up
o
elam
besiege
o
media
all
the
sighing
thereof
have
i
made
to
cease
therefore
are
my
loins
filled
with
pain
pangs
have
taken
hold
upon
me
as
the
pangs
of
a
woman
that
travaileth
i
was
bowed
down
at
the
hearing
of
it
i
was
dismayed
at
the
seeing
of
it
my
heart
panted
fearfulness

and

for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
set
a
watchman
let
him
declare
what
he
seeth
and
he
saw
a
chariot
with
a
couple
of
horsemen
a
chariot
of
asses
and
a
chariot
of
camels
and
he
hearkened
diligently
with
much
heed
and
he
cried
a
lion
my
lord
i
stand
continually
upon
the
watchtower
in
the
daytime
and
i
am
set
in
my
ward
whole
nights
and
behold
here
cometh
a
chariot
of
men
with
a
couple
of
horsemen
and
he
answered
and
said
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
and
all
the
graven
images
of
her
gods
he
hath
broken
unto
the
ground
o
my
threshing
and
the
corn
of
my
floor
that
which
i
have
heard
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
have
i
declared
unto
you
the
burden
of
dumah
he
calleth
to
me
out
of
seir
watchman
what
of
the
night
watchman
what
of
the
night
the
watchman
said
the
morning
cometh
and
also
the
night
if
ye
will
enquire
enquire
ye
return
come
the
burden
upon
arabia
in
the
forest
in
arabia
shall
ye
lodge
o
ye
travelling
companies
of
dedanim
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
tema
brought
water
to
him
that
was
thirsty
they
prevented
with
their
bread
him
that
fled
for
they
fled
from
the
swords
from
the
drawn
sword
and
from
the
bent
bow
and
from
the
grievousness
of
war
for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
unto
me
within
a
year
according
to
the
years
of
an
hireling
and
all
the
glory
of
kedar
shall
fail
and
the
residue
of
the
number
of
archers
the
mighty
men
of
the
children
of
kedar
shall
be
diminished
for
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
spoken
it
the
burden
of
the
valley
of
vision
what
aileth
thee
now
that
thou
art
wholly
gone
up
to
the
housetops
thou
that
art
full
of
stirs
a
tumultuous
city
joyous
city
thy
slain
men
are
not
slain
with
the
sword
nor
dead
in
battle
all
thy
rulers
are
fled
together
they
are
bound
by
the
archers
all
that
are
found
in
thee
are
bound
together
which
have
fled
from
far
therefore
said
i
look
away
from
me
i
will
weep
bitterly
labour
not
to
comfort
me
because
of
the
spoiling
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
for
it
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
treading
down
and
of
perplexity
by
the
lord
god
of
hosts
in
the
valley
of
vision
breaking
down
the
walls
and
of
crying
to
the
mountains
and
elam
bare
the
quiver
with
chariots
of
men
and
horsemen
and
kir
uncovered
the
shield
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
thy
choicest
valleys
shall
be
full
of
chariots
and
the
horsemen
shall
set
themselves
in
array
at
the
gate
and
he
discovered
the
covering
of
judah
and
thou
didst
look
in
that
day
to
the
armour
of
the
house
of
the
forest
ye
have
seen
also
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
david
that
they
are
many
and
ye
gathered
together
the
waters
of
the
lower
pool
and
ye
have
numbered
the
houses
of
jerusalem
and
the
houses
have
ye
broken
down
to
fortify
the
wall
ye
made
also
a
ditch
between
the
two
walls
for
the
water
of
the
old
pool
but
ye
have
not
looked
unto
the
maker
thereof
neither
had
respect
unto
him
that
fashioned
it
long
ago
and
in
that
day
did
the
lord
god
of
hosts
call
to
weeping
and
to
mourning
and
to
baldness
and
to
girding
with
sackcloth
and
behold
joy
and
gladness
slaying
oxen
and
killing
sheep
eating
flesh
and
drinking
wine
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
to
morrow
we
shall
die
and
it
was
revealed
in
mine
ears
by
the
lord
of
hosts
surely
this
iniquity
shall
not
be
purged
from
you
till
ye
die
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
go
get
thee
unto
this
treasurer
even
unto
shebna
which
is
over
the
house
and
say
what
hast
thou
here
and
whom
hast
thou
here
that
thou
hast
hewed
thee
out
a
sepulchre
here
as
he
that
heweth
him
out
a
sepulchre
on
high
and
that
graveth
an
habitation
for
himself
in
a
rock
behold
the
lord
will
carry
thee
away
with
a
mighty
captivity
and
will
surely
cover
thee
he
will
surely
violently
turn
and
toss
thee
like
a
ball
into
a
large
country
there
shalt
thou
die
and
there
the
chariots
of
thy
glory
shall
be
the
shame
of
thy
lord's
house
and
i
will
drive
thee
from
thy
station
and
from
thy
state
shall
he
pull
thee
down
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
i
will
call
my
servant
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
and
i
will
clothe
him
with
thy
robe
and
strengthen
him
with
thy
girdle
and
i
will
commit
thy
government
into
his
hand
and
he
shall
be
a
father
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
to
the
house
of
judah
and
the
key
of
the
house
of
david
will
i
lay
upon
his
shoulder
so
he
shall
open
and
none
shall
shut
and
he
shall
shut
and
none
shall
open
and
i
will
fasten
him
as
a
nail
in
a
sure
place
and
he
shall
be
for
a
glorious
throne
to
his
father's
house
and
they
shall
hang
upon
him
all
the
glory
of
his
father's
house
the
offspring
and
the
issue
all
vessels
of
small
quantity
from
the
vessels
of
cups
even
to
all
the
vessels
of
flagons
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
the
nail
that
is
fastened
in
the
sure
place
be
removed
and
be
cut
down
and
fall
and
the
burden
that
was
upon
it
shall
be
cut
off
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
the
burden
of
tyre
howl
ye
ships
of
tarshish
for
it
is
laid
waste
so
that
there
is
no

whom
the
merchants
of
zidon

she
is
a
mart

do
i
nourish
up
young
men

commandment

my
leanness
woe
unto

that
he
who
fleeth

fear
shall
fall
into
the
pit
and
he
that
cometh
up
out
of

removed
like
a

and
the
transgression
thereof
shall
be
heavy
upon

and
it
shall
fall
and

again
and
it
shall
come
to

shall
punish
the
host
of
the
high
ones
that
are
on
high
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
upon

be
shut
up
in
the
prison
and
after
many
days
shall
they
be
visited
then
the
moon
shall
be
confounded
and
the
sun
ashamed
when
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
reign
in
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
and
before
his
ancients
gloriously
o
lord
thou
art
my
god
i
will
exalt
thee
i
will
praise
thy
name
for
thou
hast
done
wonderful
things
thy
counsels
of
old
are
faithfulness
and
truth
for
thou
hast
made
of
a
city
an
heap
of
a
defenced
city
a
ruin
a
palace
of
strangers
to
be
no
city
it
shall
never
be
built
therefore
shall
the
strong
people
glorify
thee
the
city
of
the
terrible
nations
shall
fear
thee
for
thou
hast
been
a
strength
to
the
poor
a
strength
to
the
needy
in
his
distress
a
refuge
from
the
storm
a
shadow
from
the
heat
when
the
blast
of
the
terrible
ones
is
as
a
storm
against
the
wall
thou
shalt
bring
down
the
noise
of
strangers
as
the
heat
in
a
dry
place
even
the
heat
with
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
the
branch
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
brought
low
and
in
this
mountain
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
make
unto
all
people
a
feast
of
fat
things
a
feast
of
wines
on
the
lees
of
fat
things
full
of
marrow
of
wines
on
the
lees
well
refined
and
he
will
destroy
in
this
mountain
the
face
of
the
covering
cast
over
all
people
and
the
vail
that
is
spread
over
all
nations
he
will
swallow
up
death
in
victory
and
the
lord
god
will
wipe
away
tears
from
off
all
faces
and
the
rebuke
of
his
people
shall
he
take
away
from
off
all
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
and
it
shall
be
said
in
that
day
lo
this
is
our
god

have
waited
for
him
and
he
will
save
us

is
the
lord
we
have

will
be
glad
and

mountain
shall
the
hand
of
the
lord
rest
and
moab
shall
be
trodden
down
under
him
even
as
straw
is
trodden
down
for
the
dunghill
and
he
shall
spread
forth
his
hands
in
the
midst
of
them
as
he
that
swimmeth
spreadeth
forth
his
hands
to
swim
and
he
shall
bring
down
their
pride
together
with
the
spoils
of
their
hands
and
the
fortress
of
the
high
fort
of
thy
walls
shall
he
bring
down
lay
low
and
bring
to
the
ground
even
to
the
dust
in
that
day
shall
this
song
be
sung
in
the
land
of
judah
we

a
strong
city

will
not
see
but
they
shall
see
and
be
ashamed
for
their
envy
at
the
people
yea
the
fire
of
thine
enemies
shall
devour
them
lord
thou
wilt
ordain
peace
for
us
for
thou
also
hast
wrought
all
our
works
in
us
o
lord
our
god
other
lords
beside
thee
have
had
dominion
over
us
but
by
thee
only
will
we
make
mention
of
thy
name
they
are
dead
they
shall
not
live
they
are
deceased
they
shall
not
rise
therefore
hast
thou
visited
and
destroyed
them
and
made
all
their
memory
to
perish
thou
hast
increased
the
nation
o
lord
thou
hast
increased
the
nation
thou
art
glorified
thou
hadst
removed
it
far
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
lord
in
trouble
have
they
visited
thee
they
poured
out
a
prayer
when
thy
chastening
was
upon
them
like
as
a
woman
with
child
that
draweth
near
the
time
of
her
delivery
is
in
pain
and
crieth
out
in
her
pangs
so
have
we
been
in
thy
sight
o
lord
we
have
been
with
child
we
have
been
in
pain
we
have
as
it
were
brought
forth
wind
we
have
not
wrought
any
deliverance
in
the
earth
neither
have
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
fallen
thy
dead
men
shall
live
together
with
my
dead
body
shall
they
arise
awake
and
sing
ye
that
dwell
in
dust
for
thy
dew
is
as
the
dew
of
herbs
and
the
earth
shall
cast
out
the
dead
come
my
people
enter
thou
into
thy
chambers
and
shut
thy
doors
about
thee
hide
thyself
as
it
were
for
a
little
moment
until
the
indignation
be
overpast
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
out
of
his
place
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
their
iniquity
the
earth
also
shall
disclose
her
blood
and
shall
no
more
cover
her
slain
in
that
day
the
lord
with
his
sore
and
great
and
strong
sword
shall
punish
leviathan
the
piercing
serpent
even
leviathan
that
crooked
serpent
and
he
shall
slay
the
dragon
that
is
in
the
sea
in
that
day
sing
ye
unto
her
a
vineyard
of
red
wine
i
the
lord
do
keep
it
i
will
water
it
every
moment
lest
any
hurt
it
i
will
keep
it
night
and
day
fury
is
not
in
me
who
would
set
the
briers
and
thorns
against
me
in
battle
i
would
go
through
them
i
would
burn
them
together
or
let
him
take
hold
of
my
strength
that
he
may
make
peace
with
me
and
he
shall
make
peace
with
me
he
shall
cause
them
that
come
of
jacob
to
take
root
israel
shall
blossom
and
bud
and
fill
the
face
of
the
world
with
fruit
hath
he
smitten
him
as
he
smote
those
that
smote
him
or
is
he
slain
according
to
the
slaughter
of
them
that
are
slain
by
him
in
measure
when
it
shooteth
forth
thou
wilt
debate
with
it
he
stayeth
his
rough
wind
in
the
day
of
the
east
wind
by
this
therefore
shall
the
iniquity
of
jacob
be
purged
and
this
is
all
the
fruit
to
take
away
his
sin
when
he
maketh
all
the
stones
of
the
altar
as
chalkstones
that
are
beaten
in
sunder
the
groves
and
images
shall
not
stand
up
yet
the
defenced
city
shall
be
desolate
and
the
habitation
forsaken
and
left
like
a
wilderness
there
shall
the
calf
feed
and
there
shall
he
lie
down
and
consume
the
branches
thereof
when
the
boughs
thereof
are
withered
they
shall
be
broken
off
the
women
come
and
set
them
on
fire
for
it
is
a
people
of
no
understanding
therefore
he
that
made
them
will
not
have
mercy
on
them
and
he
that
formed
them
will
shew
them
no
favour
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
beat
off
from
the
channel
of
the
river
unto
the
stream
of
egypt
and
ye
shall
be
gathered
one
by
one
o
ye
children
of
israel
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
great
trumpet
shall
be
blown
and
they
shall
come
which
were
ready
to
perish
in
the
land
of
assyria
and
the
outcasts
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
shall
worship
the
lord
in
the
holy
mount
at
jerusalem
woe
to
the
crown
of
pride
to
the
drunkards
of
ephraim
whose
glorious
beauty
is
a
fading
flower
which
are
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valleys
of
them
that
are
overcome
with
wine
behold
the
lord
hath
a
mighty
and
strong
one
which
as
a
tempest
of
hail
and
a
destroying
storm
as
a
flood
of
mighty
waters
overflowing
shall
cast
down
to
the
earth
with
the
hand
the
crown
of
pride
the
drunkards
of
ephraim
shall
be
trodden
under
feet
and
the
glorious
beauty
which
is
on
the
head
of
the
fat
valley
shall
be
a
fading
flower
and
as
the
hasty
fruit
before
the
summer
which
when
he
that
looketh
upon
it
seeth
while
it
is
yet
in
his
hand
he
eateth
it
up
in
that
day
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
be
for
a
crown
of
glory
and
for
a
diadem
of
beauty
unto
the
residue
of
his
people
and
for
a
spirit
of
judgment
to
him
that
sitteth
in
judgment
and
for
strength
to
them
that
turn
the
battle
to
the
gate
but
they
also
have
erred
through
wine
and
through
strong
drink
are
out
of
the
way
the
priest
and
the
prophet
have
erred
through
strong
drink
they
are
swallowed
up
of
wine
they
are
out
of
the
way
through
strong
drink
they
err
in
vision
they
stumble
in
judgment
for
all
tables
are
full
of
vomit
and
filthiness
so
that
there
is
no
place
clean
whom
shall
he
teach
knowledge
and
whom
shall
he
make
to
understand
doctrine
them
that
are
weaned
from
the
milk
and
drawn
from
the
breasts
for
precept
must
be
upon
precept
precept
upon
precept
line
upon
line
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
for
with
stammering
lips
and
another
tongue
will
he
speak
to
this
people
to
whom
he
said
this
is
the
rest
wherewith
ye
may
cause
the
weary
to
rest
and
this
is
the
refreshing
yet
they
would
not
hear
but
the
word
of
the
lord
was
unto
them
precept
upon
precept
precept
upon
precept
line
upon
line
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
that
they
might
go
and
fall
backward
and
be
broken
and
snared
and
taken
wherefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
scornful
men
that
rule
this
people
which
is
in
jerusalem
because
ye
have
said
we
have
made
a
covenant
with
death
and
with
hell
are
we
at
agreement
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through
it
shall
not
come
unto
us
for
we
have
made
lies
our
refuge
and
under
falsehood
have
we
hid
ourselves
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
lay
in
zion
for
a
foundation
a
stone
a
tried
stone
a
precious
corner
stone
a
sure
foundation
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste
judgment
also
will
i
lay
to
the
line
and
righteousness
to
the
plummet
and
the
hail
shall
sweep
away
the
refuge
of
lies
and
the
waters
shall
overflow
the
hiding
place
and
your
covenant
with
death
shall
be
disannulled
and
your
agreement
with
hell
shall
not
stand
when
the
overflowing
scourge
shall
pass
through
then
ye
shall
be
trodden
down
by
it
from
the
time
that
it
goeth
forth
it
shall
take
you
for
morning
by
morning
shall
it
pass
over
by
day
and
by
night
and
it
shall
be
a
vexation
only
to
understand
the
report
for
the
bed
is
shorter
than
that
a
man
can
stretch
himself
on
it
and
the
covering
narrower
than
that
he
can
wrap
himself
in
it
for
the
lord
shall
rise
up
as
in
mount
perazim
he
shall
be
wroth
as
in
the
valley
of
gibeon
that
he
may
do
his
work
his
strange
work
and
bring
to
pass
his
act
his
strange
act
now
therefore
be
ye
not
mockers
lest
your
bands
be
made
strong
for
i
have
heard
from
the
lord
god
of
hosts
a
consumption
even
determined
upon
the
whole
earth
give
ye
ear
and
hear
my
voice
hearken
and
hear
my
speech
doth
the
plowman
plow
all
day
to
sow
doth
he
open
and
break
the
clods
of
his
ground
when
he
hath
made
plain
the
face
thereof
doth
he
not
cast
abroad
the
fitches
and
scatter
the
cummin
and
cast
in
the
principal
wheat
and
the
appointed
barley
and
the
rie
in
their
place
for
his
god
doth
instruct
him
to
discretion
and
doth
teach
him
for
the
fitches
are
not
threshed
with
a
threshing
instrument
neither
is
a
cart
wheel
turned
about
upon
the
cummin
but
the
fitches
are
beaten
out
with
a
staff
and
the
cummin
with
a
rod
bread
corn
is
bruised
because
he
will
not
ever
be
threshing
it
nor
break
it
with
the
wheel
of
his
cart
nor
bruise
it
with
his
horsemen
this
also
cometh
forth
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
is
wonderful
in
counsel
and
excellent
in
working
woe
to
ariel
to
ariel
the
city
where
david
dwelt
add
ye
year
to
year
let
them
kill
sacrifices
yet
i
will
distress
ariel
and
there
shall
be
heaviness
and
sorrow
and
it
shall
be
unto
me
as
ariel
and
i
will
camp
against
thee
round
about
and
will
lay
siege
against
thee
with
a
mount
and
i
will
raise
forts
against
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
and
shalt
speak
out
of
the
ground
and
thy
speech
shall
be
low
out
of
the
dust
and
thy
voice
shall
be
as
of
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
out
of
the
ground
and
thy
speech
shall
whisper
out
of
the
dust
moreover
the
multitude
of
thy
strangers
shall
be
like
small
dust
and
the
multitude
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
away
yea
it
shall
be
at
an
instant
suddenly
thou
shalt
be
visited
of
the
lord
of
hosts
with
thunder
and
with
earthquake
and
great
noise
with
storm
and
tempest
and
the
flame
of
devouring
fire
and
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
that
fight
against
ariel
even
all
that
fight
against
her
and
her
munition
and
that
distress
her
shall
be
as
a
dream
of
a
night
vision
it
shall
even
be
as
when
an
hungry
man
dreameth
and
behold
he
eateth
but
he
awaketh
and
his
soul
is
empty
or
as
when
a
thirsty
man
dreameth
and
behold
he
drinketh
but
he
awaketh
and
behold
he
is
faint
and
his
soul
hath
appetite
so
shall
the
multitude
of
all
the
nations
be
that
fight
against
mount
zion
stay
yourselves
and
wonder
cry
ye
out
and
cry
they
are
drunken
but
not
with
wine
they
stagger
but
not
with
strong
drink
for
the
lord
hath
poured
out
upon
you
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep
and
hath
closed
your
eyes
the
prophets
and
your
rulers
the
seers
hath
he
covered
and
the
vision
of
all
is
become
unto
you
as
the
words
of
a
book
that
is
sealed
which
men
deliver
to
one
that
is
learned
saying
read
this
i
pray
thee
and
he
saith
i
cannot
for
it
is
sealed
and
the
book
is
delivered
to
him
that
is
not
learned
saying
read
this
i
pray
thee
and
he
saith
i
am
not
learned
wherefore
the
lord
said
forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
me
with
their
mouth
and
with
their
lips
do
honour
me
but
have
removed
their
heart
far
from
me
and
their
fear
toward
me
is
taught
by
the
precept
of
men
therefore
behold
i
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvellous
work
among
this
people
even
a
marvellous
work
and
a
wonder
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
men
shall
perish
and
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
men
shall
be
hid
woe
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
lord
and
their
works
are
in
the
dark
and
they
say
who
seeth
us
and
who
knoweth
us
surely
your
turning
of
things
upside
down
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
potter's
clay
for
shall
the
work
say
of
him
that
made
it
he
made
me
not
or
shall
the
thing
framed
say
of
him
that
framed
it
he
had
no
understanding
is
it
not
yet
a
very
little
while
and
lebanon
shall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
be
esteemed
as
a
forest
and
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
the
words
of
the
book
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness
the
meek
also
shall
increase
their
joy
in
the
lord
and
the
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
the
terrible
one
is
brought
to
nought
and
the
scorner
is
consumed
and
all
that
watch
for
iniquity
are
cut
off
that
make
a
man
an
offender
for
a
word
and
lay
a
snare
for
him
that
reproveth
in
the
gate
and
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thing
of
nought
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
who
redeemed
abraham
concerning
the
house
of
jacob
jacob
shall
not
now
be
ashamed
neither
shall
his
face
now
wax
pale
but
when
he
seeth
his
children
the
work
of
mine
hands
in
the
midst
of
him
they
shall
sanctify
my
name
and
sanctify
the
holy
one
of
jacob
and
shall
fear
the
god
of
israel
they
also
that
erred
in
spirit
shall
come
to
understanding
and
they
that
murmured
shall
learn
doctrine
woe
to
the
rebellious
children
saith
the
lord
that
take
counsel
but
not
of
me
and
that
cover
with
a
covering
but
not
of
my
spirit
that
they
may
add
sin
to
sin
that
walk
to
go
down
into
egypt
and
have
not
asked
at
my
mouth
to
strengthen
themselves
in
the
strength
of
pharaoh
and
to
trust
in
the
shadow
of
egypt
therefore
shall
the
strength
of
pharaoh
be
your
shame
and
the
trust
in
the
shadow
of
egypt
your
confusion
for
his
princes
were
at
zoan
and
his
ambassadors
came
to
hanes
they
were
all
ashamed
of
a
people
that
could
not
profit
them
nor
be
an
help
nor
profit
but
a
shame
and
also
a
reproach
the
burden
of
the
beasts
of
the
south
into
the
land
of
trouble
and
anguish
from
whence
come
the
young
and
old
lion
the
viper
and
fiery
flying
serpent
they
will
carry
their
riches
upon
the
shoulders
of
young
asses
and
their
treasures
upon
the
bunches
of
camels
to
a
people
that
shall
not
profit
them
for
the
egyptians
shall
help
in
vain
and
to
no
purpose
therefore
have
i
cried
concerning
this
their
strength
is
to
sit
still
now
go
write
it
before
them
in
a
table
and
note
it
in
a
book
that
it
may
be
for
the
time
to
come
for
ever
and
ever
that
this
is
a
rebellious
people
lying
children
children
that
will
not
hear
the
law
of
the
lord
which
say
to
the
seers
see
not
and
to
the
prophets
prophesy
not
unto
us
right
things
speak
unto
us
smooth
things
prophesy
deceits
get
you
out
of
the
way
turn
aside
out
of
the
path
cause
the
holy
one
of
israel
to
cease
from
before
us
wherefore
thus
saith
the
holy
one
of
israel
because
ye
despise
this
word
and
trust
in
oppression
and
perverseness
and
stay
thereon
therefore
this
iniquity
shall
be
to
you
as
a
breach
ready
to
fall
swelling
out
in
a
high
wall
whose
breaking
cometh
suddenly
at
an
instant
and
he
shall
break
it
as
the
breaking
of
the
potters
vessel
that
is
broken
in
pieces
he
shall
not
spare
so
that
there
shall
not
be
found
in
the
bursting
of
it
a
sherd
to
take
fire
from
the
hearth
or
to
take
water
withal
out
of
the
pit
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
returning
and
rest
shall
ye
be
saved
in
quietness
and
in
confidence
shall
be
your
strength
and
ye
would
not
but
ye
said
no
for
we
will
flee
upon
horses
therefore
shall
ye
flee
and
we
will
ride
upon
the
swift
therefore
shall
they
that
pursue
you
be
swift
one
thousand
shall
flee
at
the
rebuke
of
one
at
the
rebuke
of
five
shall
ye
flee
till
ye
be
left
as
a
beacon
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
as
an
ensign
on
an
hill
and
therefore
will
the
lord
wait
that
he
may
be
gracious
unto
you
and
therefore
will
he
be
exalted
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
you
for
the
lord
is
a
god
of
judgment
blessed
are
all
they
that
wait
for
him
for
the
people
shall
dwell
in
zion
at
jerusalem
thou
shalt
weep
no
more
he
will
be
very
gracious
unto
thee
at
the
voice
of
thy
cry
when
he
shall
hear
it
he
will
answer
thee
and
though
the
lord
give
you
the
bread
of
adversity
and
the
water
of
affliction
yet
shall
not
thy
teachers
be
removed
into
a
corner
any
more
but
thine
eyes
shall
see
thy
teachers
and
thine
ears
shall
hear
a
word
behind
thee
saying
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
when
ye
turn
to
the
right
hand
and
when
ye
turn
to
the
left
ye
shall
defile
also
the
covering
of
thy
graven
images
of
silver
and
the
ornament
of
thy
molten
images
of
gold
thou
shalt
cast
them
away
as
a
menstruous
cloth
thou
shalt
say
unto
it
get
thee
hence
then
shall
he
give
the
rain
of
thy
seed
that
thou
shalt
sow
the
ground
withal
and
bread
of
the
increase
of
the
earth
and
it
shall
be
fat
and
plenteous
in
that
day
shall
thy
cattle
feed
in
large
pastures
the
oxen
likewise
and
the
young
asses
that
ear
the
ground
shall
eat
clean
provender
which
hath
been
winnowed
with
the
shovel
and
with
the
fan
and
there
shall
be
upon
every
high
mountain
and
upon
every
high
hill
rivers
and
streams
of
waters
in
the
day
of
the
great
slaughter
when
the
towers
fall
moreover
the
light
of
the
moon
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
light
of
the
sun
shall
be
sevenfold
as
the
light
of
seven
days
in
the
day
that
the
lord
bindeth
up
the
breach
of
his
people
and
healeth
the
stroke
of
their
wound
behold
the
name
of
the
lord
cometh
from
far
burning
with
his
anger
and
the
burden
thereof
is
heavy
his
lips
are
full
of
indignation
and
his
tongue
as
a
devouring
fire
and
his
breath
as
an
overflowing
stream
shall
reach
to
the
midst
of
the
neck
to
sift
the
nations
with
the
sieve
of
vanity
and
there
shall
be
a
bridle
in
the
jaws
of
the
people
causing
them
to
err
ye
shall
have
a
song
as
in
the
night
when
a
holy
solemnity
is
kept
and
gladness
of
heart
as
when
one
goeth
with
a
pipe
to
come
into
the
mountain
of
the
lord
to
the
mighty
one
of
israel
and
the
lord
shall
cause
his
glorious
voice
to
be
heard
and
shall
shew
the
lighting
down
of
his
arm
with
the
indignation
of
his
anger
and
with
the
flame
of
a
devouring
fire
with
scattering
and
tempest
and
hailstones
for
through
the
voice
of
the
lord
shall
the
assyrian
be
beaten
down
which
smote
with
a
rod
and
in
every
place
where
the
grounded
staff
shall
pass
which
the
lord
shall
lay
upon
him
it
shall
be
with
tabrets
and
harps
and
in
battles
of
shaking
will
he
fight
with
it
for
tophet
is
ordained
of
old
yea
for
the
king
it
is
prepared
he
hath
made
it
deep
and
large
the
pile
thereof
is
fire
and
much
wood
the
breath
of
the
lord
like
a
stream
of
brimstone
doth
kindle
it
woe
to
them
that
go
down
to
egypt
for
help
and
stay
on
horses
and
trust
in
chariots
because
they
are
many
and
in
horsemen
because
they
are
very
strong
but
they
look
not
unto
the
holy
one
of
israel
neither
seek
the
lord
yet
he
also
is
wise
and
will
bring
evil
and
will
not
call
back
his
words
but
will
arise
against
the
house
of
the
evildoers
and
against
the
help
of
them
that
work
iniquity
now
the
egyptians
are
men
and
not
god
and
their
horses
flesh
and
not
spirit
when
the
lord
shall
stretch
out
his
hand
both
he
that
helpeth
shall
fall
and
he
that
is
holpen
shall
fall
down
and
they
all
shall
fail
together
for
thus
hath
the
lord
spoken
unto
me
like
as
the
lion
and
the
young
lion
roaring
on
his
prey
when
a
multitude
of
shepherds
is
called
forth
against
him
he
will
not
be
afraid
of
their
voice
nor
abase
himself
for
the
noise
of
them
so
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
come
down
to
fight
for
mount
zion
and
for
the
hill
thereof
as
birds
flying
so
will
the
lord
of
hosts
defend
jerusalem
defending
also
he
will
deliver
it
and
passing
over
he
will
preserve
it
turn
ye
unto
him
from
whom
the
children
of
israel
have
deeply
revolted
for
in
that
day
every
man
shall
cast
away
his
idols
of
silver
and
his
idols
of
gold
which
your
own
hands
have
made
unto
you
for
a
sin
then
shall
the
assyrian
fall
with
the
sword
not
of
a
mighty
man
and
the
sword
not
of
a
mean
man
shall
devour
him
but
he
shall
flee
from
the
sword
and
his
young
men
shall
be
discomfited
and
he
shall
pass
over
to
his
strong
hold
for
fear
and
his
princes
shall
be
afraid
of
the
ensign
saith
the
lord
whose
fire
is
in
zion
and
his
furnace
in
jerusalem
behold
a
king
shall
reign
in
righteousness
and
princes
shall
rule
in
judgment
and
a
man
shall
be
as
an
hiding
place
from
the
wind
and
a
covert
from
the
tempest
as
rivers
of
water
in
a
dry
place
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
and
the
eyes
of
them
that
see
shall
not
be
dim
and
the
ears
of
them
that
hear
shall
hearken
the
heart
also
of
the
rash
shall
understand
knowledge
and
the
tongue
of
the
stammerers
shall
be
ready
to
speak
plainly
the
vile
person
shall
be
no
more
called
liberal
nor
the
churl
said
to
be
bountiful
for
the
vile
person
will
speak
villany
and
his
heart
will
work
iniquity
to
practise
hypocrisy
and
to
utter
error
against
the
lord
to
make
empty
the
soul
of
the
hungry
and
he
will
cause
the
drink
of
the
thirsty
to
fail
the
instruments
also
of
the
churl
are
evil
he
deviseth
wicked
devices
to
destroy
the
poor
with
lying
words
even
when
the
needy
speaketh
right
but
the
liberal
deviseth
liberal
things
and
by
liberal
things
shall
he
stand
rise
up
ye
women
that
are
at
ease
hear
my
voice
ye
careless
daughters
give
ear
unto
my
speech
many
days
and
years
shall
ye
be
troubled
ye
careless
women
for
the
vintage
shall
fail
the
gathering
shall
not
come
tremble
ye
women
that
are
at
ease
be
troubled
ye
careless
ones
strip
you
and
make
you
bare
and
gird
sackcloth
upon
your
loins
they
shall
lament
for
the
teats
for
the
pleasant
fields
for
the
fruitful
vine
upon
the
land
of
my
people
shall
come
up
thorns
and
briers
yea
upon
all
the
houses
of
joy
in
the
joyous
city
because
the
palaces
shall
be
forsaken
the
multitude
of
the
city
shall
be
left
the
forts
and
towers
shall
be
for
dens
for
ever
a
joy
of
wild
asses
a
pasture
of
flocks
until
the
spirit
be
poured
upon
us
from
on
high
and
the
wilderness
be
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
field
be
counted
for
a
forest
then
judgment
shall
dwell
in
the
wilderness
and
righteousness
remain
in
the
fruitful
field
and
the
work
of
righteousness
shall
be
peace
and
the
effect
of
righteousness
quietness
and
assurance
for
ever
and
my
people
shall
dwell
in
a
peaceable
habitation
and
in
sure
dwellings
and
in
quiet
resting
places
when
it
shall
hail
coming
down
on
the
forest
and
the
city
shall
be
low
in
a
low
place
blessed
are
ye
that
sow
beside
all
waters
that
send
forth
thither
the
feet
of
the
ox
and
the
ass
woe
to
thee
that
spoilest
and
thou
wast
not
spoiled
and

treacherously
and
they
dealt
not
treacherously
with
thee
when
thou

cease
to
spoil
thou
shalt
be
spoiled
and
when
thou
shalt
make
an
end
to
deal
treacherously
they
shall
deal
treacherously
with
thee
o

us
we
have
waited
for
thee

every
morning
our
salvation

in
the
time
of
trouble
at
the
noise
of
the
tumult
the
people
fled
at
the
lifting
up
of
thyself
the
nations
were
scattered
and
your
spoil
shall
be
gathered
like
the
gathering
of
the
caterpiller
as
the
running
to

fro
of
locusts
shall
he
run
upon
them
the

dwelleth
on
high
he
hath
filled
zion
with
judgment
and
righteousness
and

the
stability
of
thy
times
and
strength
of
salvation
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
his
treasure
behold
their
valiant
ones
shall
cry
without
the
ambassadors
of

shall
weep
bitterly
the
highways
lie
waste
the
wayfaring
man

he

broken
the

despised
the

the

lebanon

myself
ye

the
hypocrites
who

with
the
devouring
fire
who
among

with
everlasting
burnings
he
that

uprightly
he
that
despiseth
the
gain
of
oppressions
that
shaketh
his
hands
from
holding
of

receiver
where
is
he
that
counted
the
towers
thou
shalt
not
see
a
fierce
people

ever
be
removed
neither

there
the
glorious

be
unto
us
a
place
of
broad
rivers
and
streams
wherein

go
no
galley
with
oars
neither

filled
with
blood

made
fat
with
fatness
and
with
the
blood
of
lambs

goats
with
the
fat
of

a
sacrifice
in

the
bullocks
with

bulls
and
their
land

soaked
with
blood

dust
made
fat
with
fatness
for
it

the
day
of
the
lord's
vengeance

the
year
of
recompences
for
the

wilderness
shall
waters
break

be
there
and
a
way
and
it
shall
be
called
the
way
of
holiness
the
unclean
shall
not
pass
over
it
but
it
shall
be
for
those
the
wayfaring
men
though
fools
shall
not
err
therein
no
lion
shall
be
there
nor
any
ravenous
beast
shall
go
up
thereon
it
shall
not
be
found
there
but
the
redeemed
shall
walk
there
and
the
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
to
zion
with
songs
and
everlasting
joy
upon
their
heads
they
shall
obtain
joy
and
gladness
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
hezekiah
that
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
came
up
against
all
the
defenced
cities
of
judah
and
took
them
and
the
king
of
assyria
sent
rabshakeh
from
lachish
to
jerusalem
unto
king
hezekiah
with
a
great
army
and
he
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field
then
came
forth
unto
him
eliakim
hilkiah's
son
which
was
over
the
house
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
asaph's
son
the
recorder
and
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
say
ye
now
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
what
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest
i
say
sayest
thou
but
they
are
but
vain
words
i
have
counsel
and
strength
for
war
now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
rebellest
against
me
lo
thou
trustest
in
the
staff
of
this
broken
reed
on
egypt
whereon
if
a
man
lean
it
will
go
into
his
hand
and
pierce
it
so
is
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
to
all
that
trust
in
him
but
if
thou
say
to
me
we
trust
in
the
lord
our
god
is
it
not
he
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
hezekiah
hath
taken
away
and
said
to
judah
and
to
jerusalem
ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar
now
therefore
give
pledges
i
pray
thee
to
my
master
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
give
thee
two
thousand
horses
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them
how
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master's
servants
and
put
thy
trust
on
egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
and
am
i
now
come
up
without
the
lord
against
this
land
to
destroy
it
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
then
said
eliakim
and
shebna
and
joah
unto
rabshakeh
speak
i
pray
thee
unto
thy
servants
in
the
syrian
language
for
we
understand
it
and
speak
not
to
us
in
the
jews
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall
but
rabshakeh
said
hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master
and
to
thee
to
speak
these
words
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
that
sit
upon
the
wall
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you
then
rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews
language
and
said
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
thus
saith
the
king
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
neither
let
hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
lord
saying
the
lord
will
surely
deliver
us
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
hearken
not
to
hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
assyria
make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present
and
come
out
to
me
and
eat
ye
every
one
of
his
vine
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
own
cistern
until
i
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
beware
lest
hezekiah
persuade
you
saying
the
lord
will
deliver
us
hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
where
are
the
gods
of
hamath
and
arphad
where
are
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
and
have
they
delivered
samaria
out
of
my
hand
who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
these
lands
that
have
delivered
their
land
out
of
my
hand
that
the
lord
should
deliver
jerusalem
out
of
my
hand
but
they
held
their
peace
and
answered
him
not
a
word
for
the
king's
commandment
was
saying
answer
him
not
then
came
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
that
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
to
hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent
and
told
him
the
words
of
rabshakeh
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
hezekiah
heard
it
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
sent
eliakim
who
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
unto
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
and
they
said
unto
him
thus
saith
hezekiah
this
day
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
rebuke
and
of
blasphemy
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth
it
may
be
the
lord
thy
god
will
hear
the
words
of
rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
and
will
reprove
the
words
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
heard
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
is
left
so
the
servants
of
king
hezekiah
came
to
isaiah
and
isaiah
said
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
your
master
thus
saith
the
lord
be
not
afraid
of
the
words
that
thou
hast
heard
wherewith
the
servants
of
the
king
of
assyria
have
blasphemed
me
behold
i
will
send
a
blast
upon
him
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour
and
return
to
his
own
land
and
i
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
so
rabshakeh
returned
and
found
the
king
of
assyria
warring
against
libnah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
lachish
and
he
heard
say
concerning
tirhakah
king
of
ethiopia
he
is
come
forth
to
make
war
with
thee
and
when
he
heard
it
he
sent
messengers
to
hezekiah
saying
thus
shall
ye
speak
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
saying
let
not
thy
god
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
jerusalem
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered
have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed
as
gozan
and
haran
and
rezeph
and
the
children
of
eden
which
were
in
telassar
where
is
the
king
of
hamath
and
the
king
of
arphad
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
sepharvaim
hena
and
ivah
and
hezekiah
received
the
letter
from
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
it
and
hezekiah
went
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
spread
it
before
the
lord
and
hezekiah
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
of
hosts
god
of
israel
that
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
thou
art
the
god
even
thou
alone
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
incline
thine
ear
o
lord
and
hear
open
thine
eyes
o
lord
and
see
and
hear
all
the
words
of
sennacherib
which
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
of
a
truth
lord
the
kings
of
assyria
have
laid
waste
all
the
nations
and
their
countries
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
no
gods
but
the
work
of
men's
hands
wood
and
stone
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
now
therefore
o
lord
our
god
save
us
from
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
even
thou
only
then
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
sent
unto
hezekiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
whereas
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
this
is
the
word
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
him
the
virgin
the
daughter
of
zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee
whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high
even
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
by
thy
servants
hast
thou
reproached
the
lord
and
hast
said
by
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
am
i
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains
to
the
sides
of
lebanon
and
i
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedars
thereof
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof
and
i
will
enter
into
the
height
of
his
border
and
the
forest
of
his
carmel
i
have
digged
and
drunk
water
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
i
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
the
besieged
places
hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago
how
i
have
done
it
and
of
ancient
times
that
i
have
formed
it
now
have
i
brought
it
to
pass
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
defenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps
therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field
and
as
the
green
herb
as
the
grass
on
the
housetops
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up
but
i
know
thy
abode
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
thy
rage
against
me
because
thy
rage
against
me
and
thy
tumult
is
come
up
into
mine
ears
therefore
will
i
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
as
groweth
of
itself
and
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye
and
reap
and
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
judah
shall
again
take
root
downward
and
bear
fruit
upward
for
out
of
jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
zion
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
do
this
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
king
of
assyria
he
shall
not
come
into
this
city
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there
nor
come
before
it
with
shields
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it
by
the
way
that
he
came
by
the
same
shall
he
return
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david's
sake
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
forth
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
a
hundred
and
fourscore
and
five
thousand
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
they
were
all
dead
corpses
so
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
departed
and
went
and
returned
and
dwelt
at
nineveh
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
nisroch
his
god
that
adrammelech
and
sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
armenia
and
esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
those
days
was
hezekiah
sick
unto
death
and
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
came
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
set
thine
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
live
then
hezekiah
turned
his
face
toward
the
wall
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
said
remember
now
o
lord
i
beseech
thee
how
i
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight
and
hezekiah
wept
sore
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
to
isaiah
saying
go
and
say
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
defend
this
city
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
from
the
lord
that
the
lord
will
do
this
thing
that
he
hath
spoken
behold
i
will
bring
again
the
shadow
of
the
degrees
which
is
gone
down
in
the
sun
dial
of
ahaz
ten
degrees
backward
so
the
sun
returned
ten
degrees
by
which
degrees
it
was
gone
down
the
writing
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
when
he
had
been
sick
and
was
recovered
of
his
sickness
i
said
in
the
cutting
off
of
my
days
i
shall
go
to
the
gates
of
the
grave
i
am
deprived
of
the
residue
of
my
years
i
said
i
shall
not
see
the
lord
even
the
lord
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
shall
behold
man
no
more
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
mine
age
is
departed
and
is
removed
from
me
as
a
shepherd's
tent
i
have
cut
off
like
a
weaver
my
life
he
will
cut
me
off
with
pining
sickness
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me
i
reckoned
till
morning
that
as
a
lion
so
will
he
break
all
my
bones
from
day
even
to
night
wilt
thou
make
an
end
of
me
like
a
crane
or
a
swallow
so
did
i
chatter
i
did
mourn
as
a
dove
mine
eyes
fail
with
looking
upward
o
lord
i
am
oppressed
undertake
for
me
what
shall
i
say
he
hath
both
spoken
unto
me
and
himself
hath
done
it
i
shall
go
softly
all
my
years
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
o
lord
by
these
things
men
live
and
in
all
these
things
is
the
life
of
my
spirit
so
wilt
thou
recover
me
and
make
me
to
live
behold
for
peace
i
had
great
bitterness
but
thou
hast
in
love
to
my
soul
delivered
it
from
the
pit
of
corruption
for
thou
hast
cast
all
my
sins
behind
thy
back
for
the
grave
cannot
praise
thee
death
can
not
celebrate
thee
they
that
go
down
into
the
pit
cannot
hope
for
thy
truth
the
living
the
living
he
shall
praise
thee
as
i
do
this
day
the
father
to
the
children
shall
make
known
thy
truth
the
lord
was
ready
to
save
me
therefore
we
will
sing
my
songs
to
the
stringed
instruments
all
the
days
of
our
life
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
isaiah
had
said
let
them
take
a
lump
of
figs
and
lay
it
for
a
plaister
upon
the
boil
and
he
shall
recover
hezekiah
also
had
said
what
is
the
sign
that
i
shall
go
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
at
that
time
merodachbaladan
the
son
of
baladan
king
of
babylon
sent
letters
and
a
present
to
hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick
and
was
recovered
and
hezekiah
was
glad
of
them
and
shewed
them
the
house
of
his
precious
things
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
spices
and
the
precious
ointment
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
nor
in
all
his
dominion
that
hezekiah
shewed
them
not
then
came
isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
what
said
these
men
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee
and
hezekiah
said
they
are
come
from
a
far
country
unto
me
even
from
babylon
then
said
he
what
have
they
seen
in
thine
house
and
hezekiah
answered
all
that
is
in
mine
house
have
they
seen
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
i
have
not
shewed
them
then
said
isaiah
to
hezekiah
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
the
days
come
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
until
this
day
shall
be
carried
to
babylon
nothing
shall
be
left
saith
the
lord
and
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee
which
thou
shalt
beget
shall
they
take
away
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
babylon
then
said
hezekiah
to
isaiah
good
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
thou
hast
spoken
he
said
moreover
for
there
shall
be
peace
and
truth
in
my
days

my
people

your
god

comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord's
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
the
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness
prepare

the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
the
voice
said
cry
and
he
said
what
shall
i
cry
all
flesh
is
grass
and
all
the
goodliness
thereof
is
as
the
flower
of
the
field
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
because
the
spirit
of
the
lord
bloweth
upon
it
surely
the
people
is
grass
the
grass
withereth
the
flower
fadeth
but
the
word
of
our
god
shall
stand
for
ever
o
zion
that
bringest
good
tidings
get
thee
up
into
the
high
mountain
o
jerusalem
that
bringest
good
tidings
lift
up
thy
voice
with
strength
lift
it
up
be
not
afraid
say
unto
the
cities
of
judah
behold
your
god
behold
the
lord
god
will
come
with
strong
hand
and
his
arm
shall
rule
for
him
behold
his
reward
is
with
him
and
his
work
before
him
he
shall
feed
his
flock
like
a
shepherd
he
shall
gather
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom
and
shall
gently
lead
those
that
are
with
young
who
hath
measured
the
waters
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
meted
out
heaven
with
the
span
and
comprehended
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
a
measure
and
weighed
the
mountains
in
scales
and
the
hills
in
a
balance
who
hath
directed
the
spirit
of
the
lord
or
being
his
counsellor
hath
taught
him
with
whom
took
he
counsel
and
who
instructed
him
and
taught
him
in
the
path
of
judgment
and
taught
him
knowledge
and
shewed
to
him
the
way
of
understanding
behold
the
nations
are
as
a
drop
of
a
bucket
and
are
counted
as
the
small
dust
of
the
balance
behold
he
taketh
up
the
isles
as
a
very
little
thing
and
lebanon
is
not
sufficient
to
burn
nor
the
beasts
thereof
sufficient
for
a
burnt
offering
all
nations
before
him
are
as
nothing
and
they
are
counted
to
him
less
than
nothing
and
vanity
to
whom
then
will
ye
liken
god
or
what
likeness
will
ye
compare
unto
him
the
workman
melteth
a
graven
image
and
the
goldsmith
spreadeth
it
over
with
gold
and
casteth
silver
chains
he
that
is
so
impoverished
that
he
hath
no
oblation
chooseth
a
tree
that

not
rot
he
seeketh
unto
him
a
cunning
workman
to
prepare
a
graven
image
that

moved
have
ye
not
known
have
ye
not
heard
hath
it
not
been
told
you
from
the
beginning
have
ye
not
understood
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth
it
is
he
that
sitteth
upon
the
circle
of
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
are
as
grasshoppers
that
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
as
a
curtain
and
spreadeth
them
out
as
a
tent
to
dwell
in
that
bringeth
the
princes
to
nothing
he
maketh
the
judges
of
the
earth
as
vanity
yea
they
shall
not
be
planted
yea
they
shall
not
be
sown
yea
their
stock
shall
not
take
root
in
the
earth
and
he
shall
also
blow
upon
them
and
they
shall
wither
and
the
whirlwind
shall
take
them
away
as
stubble
to
whom
then
will
ye
liken
me
or
shall
i
be
equal
saith
the
holy
one
lift
up
your
eyes
on
high
and
behold
who
hath
created
these
things
that
bringeth
out
their
host
by
number
he
calleth
them
all
by
names
by
the
greatness
of
his
might
for
that
he
is
strong
in
power
not
one
faileth
why
sayest
thou
o
jacob
and
speakest
o
israel
my
way
is
hid
from
the
lord
and
my
judgment
is
passed
over
from
my
god
hast
thou
not
known
hast
thou
not
heard
that
the
everlasting
god
the
lord
the
creator
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
fainteth
not
neither
is
weary
there
is
no
searching
of
his
understanding
he
giveth
power
to
the
faint
and
to
them
that
have
no
might
he
increaseth
strength
even
the
youths
shall
faint
and
be
weary
and
the
young
men
shall
utterly
fall
but
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
they
shall
mount
up
with
wings
as
eagles
they
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
and
they
shall
walk
and
not
faint
keep
silence
before
me
o
islands
and
let
the
people
renew
their
strength
let
them
come
near
then
let
them
speak
let
us
come
near
together
to
judgment
who
raised
up
the
righteous
man
from
the
east
called
him
to
his
foot
gave
the
nations
before
him
and
made
him
rule
over
kings
he
gave
them
as
the
dust
to
his
sword
and
as
driven
stubble
to
his
bow
he
pursued
them
and
passed
safely
even
by
the
way
that
he
had
not
gone
with
his
feet
who
hath
wrought
and
done
it
calling
the
generations
from

helped
every
one
his
neighbour
and
every
one

hammer
him
that

the
anvil
saying
it

a
travailing
woman
i
will
destroy
and

once
i
will
make

mountains
and
hills
and
dry
up
all
their
herbs
and
i
will
make
the
rivers
islands
and
i
will
dry
up
the
pools
and
i
will
bring
the
blind
by
a
way
that
they
knew
not
i
will
lead
them
in
paths
that
they
have
not
known
i
will
make
darkness
light
before
them
and
crooked
things
straight
these
things
will
i
do
unto
them
and
not
forsake
them
they
shall
be
turned
back
they
shall
be
greatly
ashamed
that
trust
in
graven
images
that

to
the
molten
images
ye
are
our
gods
hear
ye
deaf
and
look
ye
blind
that
ye
may
see
who
is
blind
but
my
servant
or
deaf
as
my
messenger
that
i
sent
who
is
blind
as
he
that
is
perfect
and
blind
as
the
lord's
servant
seeing
many
things
but
thou
observest
not
opening
the
ears
but
he
heareth
not
the
lord
is
well
pleased
for
his
righteousness
sake
he
will
magnify
the
law
and
make
it
honourable
but
this
is
a
people
robbed
and
spoiled
they
are
all
of
them
snared
in
holes
and
they
are
hid
in
prison
houses
they
are
for
a
prey
and
none
delivereth
for
a
spoil
and
none
saith
restore
who
among
you
will
give
ear
to
this
who
will
hearken
and
hear
for
the
time
to
come
who
gave
jacob
for
a
spoil
and
israel
to
the
robbers
did
not
the
lord
he
against
whom
we
have
sinned
for
they
would
not
walk
in
his
ways
neither
were
they
obedient
unto
his
law
therefore
he
hath
poured
upon
him
the
fury
of
his
anger
and
the
strength
of
battle
and
it
hath
set
him
on
fire
round
about
yet
he
knew
not
and
it
burned
him
yet
he
laid
it
not
to
heart
but
now
thus
saith
the
lord
that
created
thee
o
jacob
and
he
that
formed
thee
o
israel
fear
not
for
i
have
redeemed
thee
i
have
called
thee
by
thy
name
thou
art
mine
when
thou
passest
through
the
waters
i
will
be
with
thee
and
through
the
rivers
they
shall
not
overflow
thee
when
thou
walkest
through
the
fire
thou
shalt
not
be
burned
neither
shall
the
flame
kindle
upon
thee
for
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
thy
saviour
i
gave
egypt
for
thy
ransom
ethiopia
and
seba
for
thee
since
thou
wast
precious
in
my
sight
thou
hast
been
honourable
and
i
have
loved
thee
therefore
will
i
give
men
for
thee
and
people
for
thy
life
fear
not
for
i
am
with
thee
i
will
bring
thy
seed
from
the
east
and
gather
thee
from
the
west
i
will
say
to
the
north
give
up
and
to
the
south
keep
not
back
bring
my
sons
from
far
and
my
daughters
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
even
every
one
that
is
called
by
my
name
for
i
have
created
him
for
my
glory
i
have
formed
him
yea
i
have
made
him
bring
forth
the
blind
people
that
have
eyes
and
the
deaf
that
have
ears
let
all
the
nations
be
gathered
together
and
let
the
people
be
assembled
who
among
them
can
declare
this
and
shew
us
former
things
let
them
bring
forth
their
witnesses
that
they
may
be
justified
or
let
them
hear
and
say
it
is
truth
ye
are
my
witnesses
saith
the
lord
and
my
servant
whom
i
have
chosen
that
ye
may

shall
spring
forth
shall
ye
not
know
it
i
will
even
make
a
way
in
the
wilderness
and
rivers
in
the
desert
the
beast
of
the
field
shall
honour
me
the
dragons
and

because
i
give
waters
in
the
wilderness
and
rivers
in

desert
to
give
drink
to
my
people
my
chosen
this
people
have
i
formed
for
myself
they
shall
shew
forth
my
praise
but
thou
hast
not
called
upon
me
o
jacob
but
thou
hast
been
weary
of
me
o
israel
thou
hast
not
brought
me
the
small
cattle
of
thy
burnt
offerings
neither
hast
thou
honoured
me
with
thy
sacrifices
i
have
not
caused
thee
to
serve
with
an
offering
nor
wearied
thee
with
incense
thou
hast
bought
me
no
sweet
cane
with
money
neither
hast
thou
filled
me
with
the
fat
of
thy
sacrifices
but
thou
hast
made
me
to
serve
with
thy
sins
thou
hast
wearied
me
with
thine
iniquities
i
even
i
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
sake
and
will
not
remember
thy
sins
put
me
in
remembrance
let
us
plead
together
declare
thou
that
thou
mayest
be
justified
thy
first
father
hath
sinned
and
thy
teachers
have
transgressed
against
me
therefore
i
have
profaned
the
princes
of
the
sanctuary
and
have
given
jacob
to
the
curse
and
israel
to
reproaches
yet
now

jesurun
whom
i
have
chosen
for
i
will
pour
water
upon
him
that

thirsty
and
floods
upon
the
dry
ground
i
will
pour
my
spirit
upon
thy
seed
and
my
blessing
upon
thine
offspring
and
they
shall
spring
up
as
among
the
grass
as
willows
by
the
water
courses
one
shall
say
i
am
the
lord's
and
another
shall
call
himself
by
the
name
of
jacob
and
another
shall
subscribe
with
his
hand
unto
the
lord
and
surname
himself
by
the
name
of
israel

lord
of

am
the
first
and

sit
thou
silent
and

thee
into
darkness
o
daughter
of
the
chaldeans
for
thou
shalt
no
more
be
called
the
lady
of
kingdoms
i
was
wroth
with
my
people
i
have
polluted
mine
inheritance
and
given
them
into
thine
hand
thou
didst
shew
them
no
mercy
upon
the
ancient
hast
thou
very
heavily
laid
thy
yoke
and
thou
saidst
i
shall
be
a
lady
for
ever
so
that
thou
didst
not
lay
these
things
to
thy
heart
neither
didst
remember
the
latter
end
of
it
therefore
hear
now
this
thou
that
art
given
to
pleasures
that
dwellest
carelessly
that
sayest
in
thine
heart
i
am
and
none
else
beside
me
i
shall
not
sit
as
a
widow
neither
shall
i
know
the
loss
of
children
but
these
two
things
shall
come
to
thee
in
a
moment
in
one
day
the
loss
of
children
and
widowhood
they
shall
come
upon

trusted
in
thy
wickedness
thou

said
in
thine

evil
come
upon

thou
mayest
prevail
thou

swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
and
make
mention
of
the
god
of
israel
but
not
in
truth
nor
in
righteousness
for

call
themselves
of
the
holy
city
and
stay
themselves
upon
the
god
of
israel
the
lord
of
hosts

his
name

declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
i
shewed
them

did
them
suddenly
and
they
came
to

knew
that
thou
art
obstinate
and
thy
neck
is
an
iron
sinew
and
thy
brow
brass

have
even
from
the
beginning
declared
it
to
thee

shewed
it
thee
lest
thou
shouldest
say
mine
idol
hath
done
them
and
my
graven
image
and
my
molten
image
hath
commanded
them
thou
hast
heard
see
all
this
and
will
not
ye
declare
it
i
have
shewed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
even
hidden
things
and
thou
didst
not
know
them
they
are
created
now
and
not
from
the
beginning
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
lest
thou
shouldest
say

knew
them
yea

heardest
not
yea

knewest
not
yea

that
time
that
thine
ear
was
not
opened

knew
that
thou
wouldest
deal
very
treacherously
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb
for
my
name's
sake
will
i
defer
mine
anger
and
for
my
praise
will
i
refrain
for
thee
that
i
cut
thee
not
off
behold
i
have
refined
thee
but
not
with
silver
i
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
for
mine
own
sake
even
for
mine
own
sake
will
i
do
it
for
how
should
my
name
be
polluted
and
i
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another
hearken
unto
me
o
jacob
and
israel
my
called
i
am
he
i
am
the
first
i
also
am
the
last
mine
hand
also
hath
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and

right
hand

arm
shall
be
on
the
chaldeans

even
i
have
spoken
yea

have
called
him

have
brought
him
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous
come
ye
near
unto
me

ye
this
i
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from

the
time

and
now
the
lord

and
his
spirit
hath
sent
me
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
teacheth
thee
to
profit
which
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
that
thou
shouldest
go
o
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandments
then
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
and
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me
go
ye
forth
of
babylon

from
the
chaldeans
with

voice
of
singing

this
utter
it
even
to
the
end
of
the
earth
say
ye
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
jacob
and
they
thirsted
not
when
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
he
clave
the
rock
also
and
the
waters
gushed
out
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
unto
the
wicked
listen
o
isles
unto
me
and
hearken
ye
people
from
far
the
lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name
and
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me
and
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
servant
o
israel
in
whom
i
will
be
glorified
then
i
said
i
have
laboured
in
vain
i
have
spent
my
strength
for
nought
and
in
vain
yet
surely
my
judgment
is
with
the
lord
and
my
work
with
my
god
and
now
saith
the
lord
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
to
be
his
servant
to
bring
jacob
again
to
him
though
israel
be
not
gathered
yet
shall
i
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
my
god
shall
be
my
strength
and
he
said
it
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldest
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
jacob
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
israel
i
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
gentiles
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
end
of
the
earth
thus
saith
the
lord
the
redeemer
of
israel
and
his
holy
one
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth
to
a
servant
of
rulers
kings
shall
see
and
arise
princes
also
shall
worship
because
of
the
lord
that
is
faithful
and
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
he
shall
choose
thee
thus
saith
the
lord
in
an
acceptable
time
have
i
heard
thee
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
have
i
helped
thee
and
i
will
preserve
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
to
establish
the
earth
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages
that
thou
mayest

the
prisoners

in
darkness

shall
feed
in
the
ways
and
their
pastures
shall
be
in
all
high
places
they
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
sun
smite
them
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them
and
i
will
make
all
my
mountains
a
way
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted
behold
these
shall
come
from
far
and
lo
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
and
these
from
the
land
of
sinim
sing
o
heavens
and
be
joyful
o
earth
and
break
forth
into
singing
o
mountains
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted
but
zion
said
the
lord
hath
forsaken
me
and
my
lord
hath
forgotten
me
can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
yea
they
may
forget
yet
will
i
not
forget
thee
behold
i
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
thy
children
shall
make
haste
thy
destroyers
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
shall
go
forth
of
thee
lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
behold
all
these
gather
themselves
together
and
come
to
thee
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
as
with
an
ornament
and
bind
them
on
thee
as
a
bride
doeth
for
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
shall
be
far
away
the
children
which
thou
shalt
have
after
thou
hast
lost
the
other
shall
say
again
in
thine
ears
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
give
place
to
me
that
i
may
dwell
then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
seeing
i
have
lost
my
children
and
am
desolate
a
captive
and
removing
to
and
fro
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
behold
i
was
left
alone
these
where
had
they
been
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
and
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
toward
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
lawful
captive
delivered
but
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
for
i
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee
and
i
will
save
thy
children
and
i
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
as
with
sweet
wine
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
am
thy
saviour
and
thy
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
jacob
thus
saith
the
lord
where
is
the
bill
of
your
mother's
divorcement

of
my
creditors

have
sold
you

your
iniquities

ye
sold
yourselves

wherefore
when

there
no
man

called

there
none
to
answer

my
hand
shortened
at
all

hath
brought
up
these
two
things
are
come
unto
thee
who
shall
be
sorry
for
thee
desolation
and
destruction
and
the
famine
and
the
sword
by
whom
shall
i
comfort
thee
thy
sons
have
fainted
they
lie
at
the
head
of
all
the
streets
as
a
wild
bull
in
a
net
they
are
full
of
the
fury
of
the
lord
the
rebuke
of
thy
god
therefore
hear
now
this
thou
afflicted
and
drunken
but
not
with
wine
thus
saith
thy
lord
the
lord
and
thy
god
that
pleadeth
the
cause
of
his
people
behold
i
have
taken
out
of
thine
hand
the
cup
of
trembling
even
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
my
fury
thou
shalt
no
more
drink
it
again
but
i
will
put
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
afflict
thee
which
have
said
to
thy
soul
bow
down
that
we
may
go
over
and
thou
hast
laid
thy
body
as
the
ground
and
as
the
street
to
them
that
went
over
awake
awake
put
on
thy
strength
o
zion
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
o
jerusalem
the
holy
city
for
henceforth
there
shall
no
more
come
into
thee
the
uncircumcised
and
the
unclean
shake
thyself
from
the
dust
arise
and
sit
down
o
jerusalem
loose
thyself
from
the
bands
of
thy
neck
o
captive
daughter
of
zion
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
sold
yourselves
for
nought
and
ye
shall
be
redeemed
without
money
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
my
people
went
down
aforetime
into
egypt
to
sojourn
there
and
the
assyrian
oppressed
them
without
cause
now
therefore
what
have
i
here
saith
the
lord
that
my
people
is
taken
away
for
nought
they
that
rule
over
them
make
them
to
howl
saith
the
lord
and
my
name
continually
every
day
is
blasphemed
therefore
my
people
shall
know
my
name
therefore
they
shall
know
in
that
day
that
i
am
he
that
doth
speak
behold
it
is
i
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
publisheth
peace
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good
that
publisheth
salvation
that
saith
unto
zion
thy
god
reigneth
thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
when
the
lord
shall
bring
again
zion
break
forth
into
joy
sing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem
the
lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
god
depart
ye
depart
ye
go
ye
out
from
thence
touch
no
unclean
thing
go
ye
out
of
the
midst
of
her
be
ye
clean
that
bear
the
vessels
of
the
lord
for
ye
shall
not
go
out
with
haste
nor
go
by
flight
for
the
lord
will
go
before
you
and
the
god
of
israel
will
be
your
rereward
behold
my
servant
shall
deal
prudently
he
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled
and
be
very
high
as
many
were
astonied
at
thee
his
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of
men
so
shall
he
sprinkle
many
nations
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him
for
that
which
had
not
been
told
them
shall
they
see
and
that
which
they
had
not
heard
shall
they
consider
who
hath
believed
our
report
and
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
lord
revealed
for
he
shall
grow
up
before
him
as
a
tender
plant
and
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
and
when
we
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
he
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
he
was
despised
and
we
esteemed
him
not
surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
smitten
of
god
and
afflicted
but
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
he
was
oppressed
and
he
was
afflicted
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
he
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
stricken
and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
in
his
death
because
he
had
done
no
violence
neither
was
any
deceit
in
his
mouth
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
he
hath
put
him
to
grief
when
thou
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offering
for
sin
he
shall
see
his
seed
he
shall
prolong
his
days
and
the
pleasure
of
the
lord
shall
prosper
in
his
hand
he
shall
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
shall
be
satisfied
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
for
he
shall
bear
their
iniquities
therefore
will
i
divide
him
a
portion
with
the
great
and
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong
because
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
and
he
bare
the
sin
of
many
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
sing
o
barren
thou
that
didst
not
bear
break
forth
into
singing
and
cry
aloud
thou
that
didst
not
travail
with
child
for
more
are
the
children
of
the
desolate
than
the
children
of
the
married
wife
saith
the
lord
enlarge
the
place
of
thy
tent
and
let
them
stretch
forth
the
curtains
of
thine
habitations
spare
not
lengthen
thy
cords
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
for
thou
shalt
break
forth
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
and
thy
seed
shall
inherit
the
gentiles
and
make
the
desolate
cities
to
be
inhabited
fear
not
for
thou
shalt
not
be
ashamed
neither
be
thou
confounded
for
thou
shalt
not
be
put
to
shame
for
thou
shalt
forget
the
shame
of
thy
youth
and
shalt
not
remember
the
reproach
of
thy
widowhood
any
more
for
thy
maker
is
thine
husband
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
and
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
shall
he
be
called
for
the
lord
hath
called
thee
as
a
woman
forsaken
and
grieved
in
spirit
and
a
wife
of
youth
when
thou
wast
refused
saith
thy
god
for
a
small
moment
have
i
forsaken
thee
but
with
great
mercies
will
i
gather
thee
in
a
little
wrath
i
hid
my
face
from
thee
for
a
moment
but
with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
on
thee
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
for
this
is
as
the
waters
of
noah
unto
me
for
as
i
have
sworn
that
the
waters
of
noah
should
no
more
go
over
the
earth
so
have
i
sworn
that
i
would
not
be
wroth
with
thee
nor
rebuke
thee
for
the
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
removed
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed
saith
the
lord
that
hath
mercy
on
thee
o
thou
afflicted
tossed
with
tempest
and
not
comforted
behold
i
will
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colours
and
lay
thy
foundations
with
sapphires
and
i
will
make
thy
windows
of
agates
and
thy
gates
of
carbuncles
and
all
thy
borders
of
pleasant
stones
and
all
thy
children
shall
be
taught
of
the
lord
and
great
shall
be
the
peace
of
thy
children
in
righteousness
shalt
thou
be
established
thou
shalt
be
far
from
oppression
for
thou
shalt
not
fear
and
from
terror
for
it
shall
not
come
near
thee
behold
they
shall
surely
gather
together
but
not
by
me
whosoever
shall
gather
together
against
thee
shall
fall
for
thy
sake
behold
i
have
created
the
smith
that
bloweth
the
coals
in
the
fire
and
that
bringeth
forth
an
instrument
for
his
work
and
i
have
created
the
waster
to
destroy
no
weapon
that
is
formed
against
thee
shall
prosper
and
every
tongue
that
shall
rise
against
thee
in
judgment
thou
shalt
condemn
this
is
the
heritage
of
the
servants
of
the
lord
and
their
righteousness
is
of
me
saith
the
lord
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
waters
and
he
that
hath
no
money
come
ye
buy
and
eat
yea
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price
wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
your
labour
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
hearken
diligently
unto
me
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
fatness
incline
your
ear
and
come
unto
me
hear
and
your
soul
shall
live
and
i
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
you
even
the
sure
mercies
of
david
behold
i
have
given
him
for
a
witness
to
the
people
a
leader
and
commander
to
the
people
behold
thou
shalt
call
a
nation
that
thou
knowest
not
and
nations
that
knew
not
thee
shall
run
unto
thee
because
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
for
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
he
hath
glorified
thee
seek
ye
the
lord
while
he
may
be
found
call
ye
upon
him
while
he
is
near
let
the
wicked
forsake
his
way
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts
and
let
him
return
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
him
and
to
our
god
for
he
will
abundantly
pardon
for
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
neither
are
your
ways
my
ways
saith
the
lord
for
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
so
are
my
ways
higher
than
your
ways
and
my
thoughts
than
your
thoughts
for
as
the
rain
cometh
down
and
the
snow
from
heaven
and
returneth
not
thither
but
watereth
the
earth
and
maketh
it
bring
forth
and
bud
that
it
may
give
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
to
the
eater
so
shall
my
word
be
that
goeth
forth
out
of
my
mouth
it
shall
not
return
unto
me
void
but
it
shall
accomplish
that
which
i
please
and
it
shall
prosper
in
the
thing
whereto
i
sent
it
for
ye
shall
go
out
with
joy
and
be
led
forth
with
peace
the
mountains
and
the
hills
shall
break
forth
before
you
into
singing
and
all
the
trees
of
the
field
shall
clap
their
hands
instead
of
the
thorn
shall
come
up
the
fir
tree
and
instead
of
the
brier
shall
come
up
the
myrtle
tree
and
it
shall
be
to
the
lord
for
a
name
for
an
everlasting
sign
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
thus
saith
the
lord
keep
ye
judgment
and
do
justice
for
my
salvation
is
near
to
come
and
my
righteousness
to
be
revealed
blessed
is
the
man
that
doeth
this
and
the
son
of
man
that
layeth
hold
on
it
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
keepeth
his
hand
from
doing
any
evil
neither
let
the
son
of
the
stranger
that
hath
joined
himself
to
the
lord
speak
saying
the
lord
hath
utterly
separated
me
from
his
people
neither
let
the
eunuch
say
behold
i
am
a
dry
tree
for
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
the
eunuchs
that
keep
my
sabbaths
and
choose
the
things
that
please
me
and
take
hold
of
my
covenant
even
unto
them
will
i
give
in
mine
house
and
within
my
walls
a
place
and
a
name
better
than
of
sons
and
of
daughters
i
will
give
them
an
everlasting
name
that
shall
not
be
cut
off
also
the
sons
of
the
stranger
that
join
themselves
to
the
lord
to
serve
him
and
to
love
the
name
of
the
lord
to
be
his
servants
every
one
that
keepeth
the
sabbath
from
polluting
it
and
taketh
hold
of
my
covenant
even
them
will
i
bring
to
my
holy
mountain
and
make
them
joyful
in
my
house
of
prayer
their
burnt
offerings
and
their
sacrifices
shall
be
accepted
upon
mine
altar
for
mine
house
shall
be
called
an
house
of
prayer
for
all
people
the
lord
god
which
gathereth
the
outcasts
of
israel
saith
yet
will
i
gather
others
to
him
beside
those
that
are
gathered
unto
him
all
ye
beasts
of
the
field
come
to
devour
yea
all
ye
beasts
in
the
forest
his
watchmen
are
blind
they
are
all
ignorant
they
are
all
dumb
dogs
they
cannot
bark
sleeping
lying
down
loving
to
slumber
yea
they
are
greedy
dogs
which
can
never
have
enough
and
they
are
shepherds
that
cannot
understand
they
all
look
to
their
own
way
every
one
for
his
gain
from
his
quarter
come
ye
say
they
i
will
fetch
wine
and
we
will
fill
ourselves
with
strong
drink
and
to
morrow
shall
be
as
this
day
and
much
more
abundant
the
righteous
perisheth
and
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart
and
merciful
men
are
taken
away
none

that
the
righteous
is
taken
away
from

enter
into
peace
they

walking
in
his
uprightness

sorceress
the
seed
of
the
adulterer
and
the
whore
against
whom
do
ye
sport
yourselves
against
whom
make
ye
a
wide
mouth
and
draw
out
the
tongue
are
ye
not
children
of
transgression
a
seed
of
falsehood
enflaming
yourselves
with
idols
under
every
green
tree
slaying
the
children
in
the
valleys
under
the
clifts
of
the
rocks
among
the
smooth
stones
of
the
stream
is
thy
portion
they
they
are
thy
lot
even
to
them
hast
thou
poured
a
drink
offering
thou
hast
offered
a
meat
offering
should
i
receive
comfort
in
these
upon
a
lofty
and
high
mountain
hast
thou
set
thy
bed
even
thither
wentest
thou
up
to
offer
sacrifice
behind
the
doors
also
and
the
posts
hast
thou
set
up
thy
remembrance
for
thou
hast
discovered
thyself
to
another
than
me
and
art
gone
up
thou
hast
enlarged
thy
bed
and
made
thee
a
covenant
with
them
thou
lovedst
their
bed
where
thou
sawest
it
and
thou
wentest
to
the
king
with
ointment
and
didst
increase
thy
perfumes
and
didst
send
thy
messengers
far
off
and
didst
debase
thyself
even
unto
hell
thou
art
wearied
in
the
greatness
of
thy
way
yet
saidst
thou
not
there
is
no
hope
thou
hast
found
the
life
of
thine
hand
therefore
thou
wast
not
grieved
and
of
whom
hast
thou
been
afraid
or
feared
that
thou
hast
lied
and
hast
not
remembered
me
nor
laid
it
to
thy
heart
have
not
i
held
my
peace
even
of
old
and
thou
fearest
me
not
i
will
declare
thy
righteousness
and
thy
works
for
they
shall
not
profit
thee
when
thou
criest
let
thy
companies
deliver
thee
but
the
wind
shall
carry
them
all
away
vanity
shall
take
them
but
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
me
shall
possess
the
land
and
shall
inherit
my
holy
mountain
and
shall
say
cast
ye
up
cast
ye
up
prepare
the
way
take
up
the
stumblingblock
out
of
the
way
of
my
people
for
thus

the
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
whose
name
is
holy
i
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place
with
him

contrite
and
humble
spirit
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
ones
for
i
will
not
contend
for
ever
neither
will
i
be
always
wroth
for
the
spirit
should
fail
before
me
and
the
souls
which
i
have
made
for
the
iniquity
of
his
covetousness
was
i
wroth
and
smote
him
i
hid
me
and
was
wroth
and
he
went
on
frowardly
in
the
way
of
his
heart
i
have
seen
his
ways
and
will
heal
him
i
will
lead
him
also
and
restore
comforts
unto
him
and
to
his
mourners
i
create
the
fruit
of
the
lips
peace
peace
to
him
that
is
far
off
and
to
him
that
is
near
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
heal
him
but
the
wicked
are
like
the
troubled
sea
when
it
cannot
rest
whose
waters
cast
up
mire
and
dirt
there
is
no
peace
saith
my
god
to
the
wicked
cry
aloud
spare
not
lift
up
thy
voice
like
a
trumpet
and
shew
my
people
their
transgression
and
the
house
of
jacob
their
sins
yet
they
seek
me
daily
and
delight
to
know
my
ways
as
a
nation
that
did
righteousness
and
forsook
not
the
ordinance
of
their
god
they
ask
of
me
the
ordinances
of
justice
they
take
delight
in
approaching
to
god
wherefore
have
we
fasted
say
they
and
thou
seest
not
wherefore
have
we
afflicted
our
soul
and
thou
takest
no
knowledge
behold
in
the
day
of
your
fast
ye
find
pleasure
and
exact
all
your
labours
behold
ye
fast
for
strife
and
debate
and
to
smite
with
the
fist
of
wickedness
ye
shall
not
fast
as
ye
do
this
day
to
make
your
voice
to
be
heard
on
high
is
it
such
a
fast
that
i
have
chosen
a
day
for
a
man
to
afflict
his
soul
is
it
to
bow
down
his
head
as
a
bulrush
and
to
spread
sackcloth
and
ashes
under
him
wilt
thou
call
this
a
fast
and
an
acceptable
day
to
the
lord
is
not
this
the
fast
that
i
have
chosen
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
that
ye
break
every
yoke
is
it
not
to
deal
thy
bread
to
the
hungry
and
that
thou
bring
the
poor
that
are
cast
out
to
thy
house
when
thou
seest
the
naked
that
thou
cover
him
and
that
thou
hide
not
thyself
from
thine
own
flesh
then
shall
thy
light
break
forth
as
the
morning
and
thine
health
shall
spring
forth
speedily
and
thy
righteousness
shall
go
before
thee
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
thy
rereward
then
shalt
thou
call
and
the
lord
shall
answer
thou
shalt
cry
and
he
shall
say
here
i
am
if
thou
take
away
from
the
midst
of
thee
the
yoke
the
putting
forth
of
the
finger
and
speaking
vanity
and
if
thou
draw
out
thy
soul
to
the
hungry
and
satisfy
the
afflicted
soul
then
shall
thy
light
rise
in
obscurity
and
thy
darkness
be
as
the
noon
day
and
the
lord
shall
guide
thee
continually
and
satisfy
thy
soul
in
drought
and
make
fat
thy
bones
and
thou
shalt
be
like
a
watered
garden
and
like
a
spring
of
water
whose
waters
fail
not
and
they
that
shall
be
of
thee
shall
build
the
old
waste
places
thou
shalt
raise
up
the
foundations
of
many
generations
and
thou
shalt
be
called
the
repairer
of
the
breach
the
restorer
of
paths
to
dwell
in
if
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
the
sabbath
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight
the
holy
of
the
lord
honourable
and
shalt
honour
him
not
doing
thine
own
ways
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure
nor
speaking
thine
own
words
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
i
will
cause
thee
to
ride
upon
the
high
places
of
the
earth
and
feed
thee
with
the
heritage
of
jacob
thy
father
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
behold
the
lord's
hand
is
not
shortened
that
it
cannot
save
neither
his
ear
heavy
that
it
cannot
hear
but
your
iniquities
have
separated
between
you
and
your
god
and
your
sins
have
hid
his
face
from
you
that
he
will
not
hear
for
your
hands
are
defiled
with
blood
and
your
fingers
with
iniquity
your
lips
have
spoken
lies
your
tongue
hath
muttered
perverseness
none
calleth
for
justice
nor
any
pleadeth
for
truth
they
trust
in
vanity
and
speak
lies
they
conceive
mischief
and
bring
forth
iniquity
they
hatch
cockatrice
eggs
and
weave
the
spider's
web
he
that
eateth
of
their
eggs
dieth
and
that
which
is
crushed
breaketh
out
into
a
viper
their
webs
shall
not
become
garments
neither
shall
they
cover
themselves
with
their
works
their
works
are
works
of
iniquity
and
the
act
of
violence
is
in
their
hands
their
feet
run
to
evil
and
they
make
haste
to
shed
innocent
blood
their
thoughts
are
thoughts
of
iniquity
wasting
and
destruction
are
in
their
paths
the
way
of
peace
they
know
not
and
there
is
no
judgment
in
their
goings
they
have
made
them
crooked
paths
whosoever
goeth
therein
shall
not
know
peace
therefore
is
judgment
far
from
us
neither
doth
justice
overtake
us
we
wait
for
light
but
behold
obscurity
for
brightness
but
we
walk
in
darkness
we
grope
for
the
wall
like
the
blind
and
we
grope
as
if
we
had
no
eyes
we
stumble
at
noon
day
as
in
the
night
we
are
in
desolate
places
as
dead
men
we
roar
all
like
bears
and
mourn
sore
like
doves
we
look
for
judgment
but
there
is
none
for
salvation
but
it
is
far
off
from
us
for
our
transgressions
are
multiplied
before
thee
and
our
sins
testify
against
us
for
our
transgressions
are
with
us
and
as
for
our
iniquities
we
know
them
in
transgressing
and
lying
against
the
lord
and
departing
away
from
our
god
speaking
oppression
and
revolt
conceiving
and
uttering
from
the
heart
words
of
falsehood
and
judgment
is
turned
away
backward
and
justice
standeth
afar
off
for
truth
is
fallen
in
the
street
and
equity
cannot
enter
yea
truth
faileth
and
he
that
departeth
from
evil
maketh
himself
a
prey
and
the
lord
saw
it
and
it
displeased
him
that
there
was
no
judgment
and
he
saw
that
there
was
no
man
and
wondered
that
there
was
no
intercessor
therefore
his
arm
brought
salvation
unto
him
and
his
righteousness
it
sustained
him
for
he
put
on
righteousness
as
a
breastplate
and
an
helmet
of
salvation
upon
his
head
and
he
put
on
the
garments
of
vengeance
for
clothing
and
was
clad
with
zeal
as
a
cloak
according
to
their
deeds
accordingly
he
will
repay
fury
to
his
adversaries
recompence
to
his
enemies
to
the
islands
he
will
repay
recompence
so
shall
they
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
from
the
west
and
his
glory
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
the
enemy
shall
come
in
like
a
flood
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
lift
up
a
standard
against
him
and
the
redeemer
shall
come
to
zion
and
unto
them
that
turn
from
transgression
in
jacob
saith
the
lord
as
for
me
this
is
my
covenant
with
them
saith
the
lord
my
spirit
that
is
upon
thee
and
my
words
which
i
have
put
in
thy
mouth
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed's
seed
saith
the
lord
from
henceforth
and
for
ever
arise

for
thy
light
is
come
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
is
risen
upon
thee
for
behold
the
darkness
shall
cover
the
earth
and
gross
darkness
the
people
but
the
lord
shall
arise
upon
thee
and
his
glory
shall
be
seen
upon
thee
and
the
gentiles
shall
come
to
thy
light
and

to
the
brightness
of
thy
rising

up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
see
all
they
gather
themselves
together
they
come
to
thee
thy
sons
shall
come
from
far
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
nursed
at
thy
side
then
thou
shalt
see
and
flow
together
and
thine
heart
shall
fear
and
be
enlarged
because
the
abundance
of
the
sea
shall
be
converted
unto
thee
the
forces
of
the
gentiles

come
unto
thee
the
multitude
of
camels

cover
thee

forth
the
praises

be
gathered
together
unto
thee

minister
unto
thee

shall
come
up
with
acceptance
on
mine
altar
and
i
will
glorify
the
house
of
my
glory
who
are
these
that
fly
as
a
cloud
and
as
the
doves
to
their
windows
surely
the
isles
shall
wait
for
me
and
the
ships
of
tarshish
first
to
bring
thy
sons
from
far
their
silver
and
their
gold
with
them
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
to
the
holy
one
of
israel
because
he
hath
glorified
thee
and
the
sons
of
strangers
shall
build
up
thy
walls
and
their
kings
shall
minister
unto
thee
for
in
my
wrath
i
smote
thee
but
in
my
favour
have
i
had
mercy
on
thee
therefore
thy
gates
shall
be
open
continually
they
shall
not
be
shut
day
nor
night
that
men
may
bring
unto
thee
the
forces

her
bud
and
as

garden
causeth
the

anger
and
trample
them
in
my
fury
and
their
blood
shall
be
sprinkled
upon
my
garments
and
i
will
stain
all
my
raiment
for
the
day
of
vengeance
is
in
mine
heart
and
the
year
of
my
redeemed
is
come
and
i
looked
and
there
was
none
to
help
and
i
wondered
that
there
was
none
to
uphold
therefore
mine
own
arm
brought
salvation
unto
me
and
my
fury
it
upheld
me
and
i
will
tread
down
the
people
in
mine
anger
and
make
them
drunk
in
my
fury
and
i
will
bring
down
their
strength
to
the
earth
i
will
mention
the
lovingkindnesses
of
the
lord
and
the
praises
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
the
lord
hath
bestowed
on
us
and
the
great
goodness
toward
the
house
of
israel
which
he
hath
bestowed
on
them
according
to
his
mercies
and
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
lovingkindnesses
for
he
said
surely
they
are
my
people
children
that
will
not
lie
so
he
was
their
saviour
in
all
their
affliction
he
was
afflicted
and
the
angel
of
his
presence
saved
them
in
his
love
and
in
his
pity
he
redeemed
them
and
he
bare
them
and
carried
them
all
the
days
of
old
but
they
rebelled
and
vexed
his
holy
spirit
therefore
he
was
turned
to
be
their
enemy
and
he
fought
against
them
then
he
remembered
the
days
of
old
moses
and
his
people
saying
where
is
he
that
brought
them
up
out
of
the
sea
with
the
shepherd
of
his
flock
where
is
he
that
put
his
holy
spirit
within
him
that
led
them
by
the
right
hand
of
moses
with
his
glorious
arm
dividing
the
water
before
them
to
make
himself
an
everlasting
name
that
led
them
through
the
deep
as
an
horse
in
the
wilderness
that
they
should
not
stumble
as
a
beast
goeth
down
into
the
valley
the
spirit
of
the
lord
caused
him
to
rest
so
didst
thou
lead
thy
people
to
make
thyself
a
glorious
name
look
down
from
heaven
and
behold
from
the
habitation
of
thy
holiness
and
of
thy
glory
where
is
thy
zeal
and
thy
strength
the
sounding
of
thy
bowels
and
of
thy
mercies
toward
me
are
they
restrained
doubtless
thou
art
our
father
though
abraham
be
ignorant
of
us
and
israel
acknowledge
us
not
thou
o
lord
art
our
father
our
redeemer
thy
name
is
from
everlasting
o
lord
why
hast
thou
made
us
to
err
from
thy
ways
and
hardened
our
heart
from
thy
fear
return
for
thy
servants
sake
the
tribes
of
thine
inheritance
the
people
of
thy
holiness
have
possessed
it
but
a
little
while
our
adversaries
have
trodden
down
thy
sanctuary
we
are
thine
thou
never
barest
rule
over
them
they
were
not
called
by
thy
name
oh
that
thou
wouldest
rend
the
heavens
that
thou
wouldest
come
down
that
the
mountains
might
flow
down
at
thy
presence
as
when
the
melting
fire
burneth
the
fire
causeth
the
waters
to
boil
to
make
thy
name
known
to
thine
adversaries
that
the
nations
may
tremble
at
thy
presence
when
thou
didst
terrible
things
which
we
looked
not
for
thou
camest
down
the
mountains
flowed
down
at
thy
presence
for
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
men
have
not
heard
nor
perceived
by
the
ear
neither
hath
the
eye
seen
o
god
beside
thee
what
he
hath
prepared
for
him
that
waiteth
for
him
thou
meetest
him
that
rejoiceth
and
worketh
righteousness
those
that
remember
thee
in
thy
ways
behold
thou
art
wroth
for
we
have
sinned
in
those
is
continuance
and
we
shall
be
saved
but
we
are
all
as
an
unclean
thing
and
all
our
righteousnesses
are
as
filthy
rags
and
we
all
do
fade
as
a
leaf
and
our
iniquities
like
the
wind
have
taken
us
away
and
there
is
none
that
calleth
upon
thy
name
that
stirreth
up
himself
to
take
hold
of
thee
for
thou
hast
hid
thy
face
from
us
and
hast
consumed
us
because
of
our
iniquities
but
now
o
lord
thou
art
our
father
we
are
the
clay
and
thou
our
potter
and
we
all
are
the
work
of
thy
hand
be
not
wroth
very
sore
o
lord
neither
remember
iniquity
for
ever
behold
see
we
beseech
thee
we
are
all
thy
people
thy
holy
cities
are
a
wilderness
zion
is
a
wilderness
jerusalem
a
desolation
our
holy
and
our
beautiful
house
where
our
fathers
praised
thee
is
burned
up
with
fire
and
all
our
pleasant
things
are
laid
waste
wilt
thou
refrain
thyself
for
these
things
o
lord
wilt
thou
hold
thy
peace
and
afflict
us
very
sore
i
am
sought
of
them
that
asked
not
for
me
i
am
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not
i
said
behold
me
behold
me
unto
a
nation
that
was
not
called
by
my
name
i
have
spread
out
my
hands
all
the
day
unto
a
rebellious
people
which
walketh
in
a
way
that
was
not
good
after
their
own
thoughts
a
people
that
provoketh
me
to
anger
continually
to
my
face
that
sacrificeth
in
gardens
and
burneth
incense
upon
altars
of
brick
which
remain
among
the
graves
and
lodge
in
the
monuments
which
eat
swine's
flesh
and
broth
of
abominable
things
is
in
their
vessels
which
say
stand
by
thyself
come
not
near
to
me
for
i
am
holier
than
thou
these
are
a
smoke
in
my
nose
a
fire
that
burneth
all
the
day
behold
it
is
written
before
me
i
will
not
keep
silence
but
will
recompense
even
recompense
into
their
bosom
your
iniquities
and
the
iniquities
of
your
fathers
together
saith
the
lord
which
have
burned
incense
upon
the
mountains
and
blasphemed
me
upon
the
hills
therefore
will
i
measure
their
former
work
into
their
bosom
thus
saith
the
lord
as
the
new
wine
is
found
in
the
cluster
and
one
saith
destroy
it
not
for
a
blessing
is
in
it
so
will
i
do
for
my
servants
sakes
that
i
may
not
destroy
them
all
and
i
will
bring
forth
a
seed
out
of
jacob
and
out
of
judah
an
inheritor
of
my
mountains
and
mine
elect
shall
inherit
it
and
my
servants
shall
dwell
there
and
sharon
shall
be
a
fold
of
flocks
and
the
valley
of
achor
a
place
for
the
herds
to
lie
down
in
for
my
people
that
have
sought
me
but
ye
are
they
that
forsake
the
lord
that
forget
my
holy
mountain
that
prepare
a
table
for
that
troop
and
that
furnish
the
drink
offering
unto
that
number
therefore
will
i
number
you
to
the
sword
and
ye
shall
all
bow
down
to
the
slaughter
because
when
i
called
ye
did
not
answer
when
i
spake
ye
did
not
hear
but
did
evil
before
mine
eyes
and
did
choose
that
wherein
i
delighted
not
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
my
servants
shall
eat
but
ye
shall
be
hungry
behold
my
servants
shall
drink
but
ye
shall
be
thirsty
behold
my
servants
shall
rejoice
but
ye
shall
be
ashamed
behold
my
servants
shall
sing
for
joy
of
heart
but
ye
shall
cry
for
sorrow
of
heart
and
shall
howl
for
vexation
of
spirit
and
ye
shall
leave
your
name
for
a
curse
unto
my
chosen
for
the
lord
god
shall
slay
thee
and
call
his
servants
by
another
name
that
he
who
blesseth
himself
in
the
earth
shall
bless
himself
in
the
god
of
truth
and
he
that
sweareth
in
the
earth
shall
swear
by
the
god
of
truth
because
the
former
troubles
are
forgotten
and
because
they
are
hid
from
mine
eyes
for
behold
i
create
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
and
the
former
shall
not
be
remembered
nor
come
into
mind
but
be
ye
glad
and
rejoice
for
ever
in
that
which
i
create
for
behold
i
create
jerusalem
a
rejoicing
and
her
people
a
joy
and
i
will
rejoice
in
jerusalem
and
joy
in
my
people
and
the
voice
of
weeping
shall
be
no
more
heard
in
her
nor
the
voice
of
crying
there
shall
be
no
more
thence
an
infant
of
days
nor
an
old
man
that
hath
not
filled
his
days
for
the
child
shall
die
an
hundred
years
old
but
the
sinner
being
an
hundred
years
old
shall
be
accursed
and
they
shall
build
houses
and
inhabit
them
and
they
shall
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
they
shall
not
build
and
another
inhabit
they
shall
not
plant
and
another
eat
for
as
the
days
of
a
tree
are
the
days
of
my
people
and
mine
elect
shall
long
enjoy
the
work
of
their
hands
they
shall
not
labour
in
vain
nor
bring
forth
for
trouble
for
they
are
the
seed
of
the
blessed
of
the
lord
and
their
offspring
with
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
feed
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
bullock
and
dust
shall
be
the
serpent's
meat
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
the
heaven
is
my
throne
and
the
earth
is
my
footstool
where
is
the
house
that
ye
build
unto
me
and
where
is
the
place
of
my
rest
for
all
those
things
hath
mine
hand
made
and
all
those
things
have
been
saith
the
lord
but
to
this
man
will
i
look
even
to
him
that
is
poor
and
of
a
contrite
spirit
and
trembleth
at
my
word
he
that
killeth
an
ox
is
as
if
he
slew
a
man
he
that
sacrificeth
a
lamb
as
if
he
cut
off
a
dog's
neck
he
that
offereth
an
oblation
as
if
he
offered
swine's
blood
he
that
burneth
incense
as
if
he
blessed
an
idol
yea
they
have
chosen
their
own
ways
and
their
soul
delighteth
in
their
abominations
i
also
will
choose
their
delusions
and
will
bring
their
fears
upon
them
because
when
i
called
none
did
answer
when
i
spake
they
did
not
hear
but
they
did
evil
before
mine
eyes
and
chose
that
in
which
i
delighted
not
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
that
tremble
at
his
word
your
brethren
that
hated
you
that
cast
you
out
for
my
name's
sake
said
let
the
lord
be
glorified
but
he
shall
appear
to
your
joy
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
a
voice
of
noise
from
the
city
a
voice
from
the
temple
a
voice
of
the
lord
that
rendereth
recompence
to
his
enemies
before
she
travailed
she
brought
forth
before
her
pain
came
she
was
delivered
of
a
man
child
who
hath
heard
such
a
thing
who
hath
seen
such
things
shall
the
earth
be
made
to
bring
forth
in
one
day
or
shall
a
nation
be
born
at
once
for
as
soon
as
zion
travailed
she
brought
forth
her
children
shall
i
bring
to
the
birth
and
not
cause
to
bring
forth
saith
the
lord
shall
i
cause
to
bring
forth
and
shut
the
womb
saith
thy
god
rejoice
ye
with
jerusalem
and
be
glad
with
her
all
ye
that
love
her
rejoice
for
joy
with
her
all
ye
that
mourn
for
her
that
ye
may
suck
and
be
satisfied
with
the
breasts
of
her
consolations
that
ye
may
milk
out
and
be
delighted
with
the
abundance
of
her
glory
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
extend
peace
to
her
like
a
river
and
the
glory
of
the
gentiles
like
a
flowing
stream
then
shall
ye
suck
ye
shall
be
borne
upon
her
sides
and
be
dandled
upon
her
knees
as
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
so
will
i
comfort
you
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
in
jerusalem
and
when
ye
see
this
your
heart
shall
rejoice
and
your
bones
shall
flourish
like
an
herb
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
shall
be
known
toward
his
servants
and
his
indignation
toward
his
enemies
for
behold
the
lord
will
come
with
fire
and
with
his
chariots
like
a
whirlwind
to
render
his
anger
with
fury
and
his
rebuke
with
flames
of
fire
for
by
fire
and
by
his
sword
will
the
lord
plead
with
all
flesh
and
the
slain
of
the
lord
shall
be
many
they
that
sanctify
themselves
and
purify
themselves
in
the
gardens
behind
one
tree
in
the
midst
eating
swine's
flesh
and
the
abomination
and
the
mouse
shall
be
consumed
together
saith
the
lord
for
i
know
their
works
and
their
thoughts
it
shall
come
that
i
will
gather
all
nations
and
tongues
and
they
shall
come
and
see
my
glory
and
i
will
set
a
sign
among
them
and
i
will
send
those
that
escape
of
them
unto
the
nations
to
tarshish
pul
and
lud
that
draw
the
bow
to
tubal
and
javan
to
the
isles
afar
off
that
have
not
heard
my
fame
neither
have
seen
my
glory
and
they
shall
declare
my
glory
among
the
gentiles
and
they
shall
bring
all
your
brethren
for
an
offering
unto
the
lord
out
of
all
nations
upon
horses
and
in
chariots
and
in
litters
and
upon
mules
and
upon
swift
beasts
to
my
holy
mountain
jerusalem
saith
the
lord
as
the
children
of
israel
bring
an
offering
in
a
clean
vessel
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
i
will
also
take
of
them
for
priests
and
for
levites
saith
the
lord
for
as
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
which
i
will
make
shall
remain
before
me
saith
the
lord
so
shall
your
seed
and
your
name
remain
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
from
one
new
moon
to
another
and
from
one
sabbath
to
another
shall
all
flesh
come
to
worship
before
me
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
go
forth
and
look
upon
the
carcases
of
the
men
that
have
transgressed
against
me
for
their
worm
shall
not
die
neither
shall
their
fire
be
quenched
and
they
shall
be
an
abhorring
unto
all
flesh
the
book
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
the
words
of
jeremiah
the
son
of
hilkiah
of
the
priests
that
were
in
anathoth
in
the
land
of
benjamin
to
whom
the
word
of
the
lord
came
in
the
days
of
josiah
the
son
of
amon
king
of
judah
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
his
reign
it
came
also
in
the
days
of
jehoiakim
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
unto
the
end
of
the
eleventh
year
of
zedekiah
the
son
of
josiah
king
of
judah
unto
the
carrying
away
of
jerusalem
captive
in
the
fifth
month
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
before
i
formed
thee
in
the
belly
i
knew
thee
and
before
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
womb
i
sanctified
thee
and
i
ordained
thee
a
prophet
unto
the
nations
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
i
cannot
speak
for
i
am
a
child
but
the
lord
said
unto
me
say
not
i
am
a
child
for
thou
shalt
go
to
all
that
i
shall
send
thee
and
whatsoever
i
command
thee
thou
shalt
speak
be
not
afraid
of
their
faces
for
i
am
with
thee
to
deliver
thee
saith
the
lord
then
the
lord
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
my
mouth
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
behold
i
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth
see
i
have
this
day
set
thee
over
the
nations
and
over
the
kingdoms
to
root
out
and
to
pull
down
and
to
destroy
and
to
throw
down
to
build
and
to
plant
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
jeremiah
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
i
see
a
rod
of
an
almond
tree
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
thou
hast
well
seen
for
i
will
hasten
my
word
to
perform
it
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
the
second
time
saying
what
seest
thou
and
i
said
i
see
a
seething
pot
and
the
face
thereof
is
toward
the
north
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
out
of
the
north
an
evil
shall
break
forth
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
for
lo
i
will
call
all
the
families
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
north
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
come
and
they
shall
set
every
one
his
throne
at
the
entering
of
the
gates
of
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
walls
thereof
round
about
and
against
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
i
will
utter
my
judgments
against
them
touching
all
their
wickedness
who
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
and
worshipped
the
works
of
their
own
hands
thou
therefore
gird
up
thy
loins
and
arise
and
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
command
thee
be
not
dismayed
at
their
faces
lest
i
confound
thee
before
them
for
behold
i
have
made
thee
this
day
a
defenced
city
and
an
iron
pillar
and
brasen
walls
against
the
whole
land
against
the
kings
of
judah
against
the
princes
thereof
against
the
priests
thereof
and
against
the
people
of
the
land
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
i
am
with
thee
saith
the
lord
to
deliver
thee
moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
go
and
cry
in
the
ears
of
jerusalem
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
remember
thee
the
kindness
of
thy
youth
the
love
of
thine
espousals
when
thou
wentest
after
me
in
the
wilderness
in
a
land
that
was
not
sown
israel
was
holiness
unto
the
lord
and
the
firstfruits
of
his
increase
all
that
devour
him
shall
offend
evil
shall
come
upon
them
saith
the
lord
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
o
house
of
jacob
and
all
the
families
of
the
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
what
iniquity
have
your
fathers
found
in
me
that
they
are
gone
far
from
me
and
have
walked
after
vanity
and
are
become
vain
neither
said
they
where
is
the
lord
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
that
led
us
through
the
wilderness
through
a
land
of
deserts
and
of
pits
through
a
land
of
drought
and
of
the
shadow
of
death
through
a
land
that
no
man
passed
through
and
where
no
man
dwelt
and
i
brought
you
into
a
plentiful
country
to
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
goodness
thereof
but
when
ye
entered
ye
defiled
my
land
and
made
mine
heritage
an
abomination
the
priests
said
not
where
is
the
lord
and
they
that
handle
the
law
knew
me
not
the
pastors
also
transgressed
against
me
and
the
prophets
prophesied
by
baal
and
walked
after
things
that
do
not
profit
wherefore
i
will
yet
plead
with
you
saith
the
lord
and
with
your
children's
children
will
i
plead
for
pass
over
the
isles
of
chittim
and
see
and
send
unto
kedar
and
consider
diligently
and
see
if
there
be
such
a
thing
hath
a
nation
changed
their
gods
which
are
yet
no
gods
but
my
people
have
changed
their
glory
for
that
which
doth
not
profit
be
astonished
o
ye
heavens
at
this
and
be
horribly
afraid
be
ye
very
desolate
saith
the
lord
for
my
people
have
committed
two
evils
they
have
forsaken
me
the
fountain
of
living
waters
and
hewed
them
out
cisterns
broken
cisterns
that
can
hold
no
water
is
israel
a
servant
is
he
a
homeborn
slave
why
is
he
spoiled
the
young
lions
roared
upon
him
and
yelled
and
they
made
his
land
waste
his
cities
are
burned
without
inhabitant
also
the
children
of
noph
and
tahapanes
have
broken
the
crown
of
thy
head
hast
thou
not
procured
this
unto
thyself
in
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
when
he
led
thee
by
the
way
and
now
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
egypt
to
drink
the
waters
of
sihor
or
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
assyria
to
drink
the
waters
of
the
river
thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee
know
therefore
and
see
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
and
bitter
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
and
that
my
fear
is
not
in
thee
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
of
old
time
i
have
broken
thy
yoke
and
burst
thy
bands
and
thou
saidst
i
will
not
transgress
when
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
thou
wanderest
playing
the
harlot
yet
i
had
planted
thee
a
noble
vine
wholly
a
right
seed
how
then
art
thou
turned
into
the
degenerate
plant
of
a
strange
vine
unto
me
for
though
thou
wash
thee
with
nitre
and
take
thee
much
soap
yet
thine
iniquity
is
marked
before
me
saith
the
lord
god
how
canst
thou
say
i
am
not
polluted
i
have
not
gone
after
baalim
see
thy
way
in
the
valley
know
what
thou
hast
done
thou
art
a
swift
dromedary
traversing
her
ways
a
wild
ass
used
to
the
wilderness
that
snuffeth
up
the
wind
at
her
pleasure
in
her
occasion
who
can
turn
her
away
all
they
that
seek
her
will
not
weary
themselves
in
her
month
they
shall
find
her
withhold
thy
foot
from
being
unshod
and
thy
throat
from
thirst
but
thou
saidst
there
is
no
hope
no
for
i
have
loved
strangers
and
after
them
will
i
go
as
the
thief
is
ashamed
when
he
is
found
so
is
the
house
of
israel
ashamed
they
their
kings
their
princes
and
their
priests
and
their
prophets
saying
to
a
stock
thou
art
my
father
and
to
a
stone
thou
hast
brought
me
forth
for
they
have
turned
their
back
unto
me
and
not
their
face
but
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
they
will
say
arise
and
save
us
but
where
are
thy
gods
that
thou
hast
made
thee
let
them
arise
if
they
can
save
thee
in
the
time
of
thy
trouble
for
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
are
thy
gods
o
judah
wherefore
will
ye
plead
with
me
ye
all
have
transgressed
against
me
saith
the
lord
in
vain
have
i
smitten
your
children
they
received
no
correction
your
own
sword
hath
devoured
your
prophets
like
a
destroying
lion
o
generation
see
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
have
i
been
a
wilderness
unto
israel
a
land
of
darkness
wherefore
say
my
people
we
are
lords
we
will
come
no
more
unto
thee
can
a
maid
forget
her
ornaments
or
a
bride
her
attire
yet
my
people
have
forgotten
me
days
without
number
why
trimmest
thou
thy
way
to
seek
love
therefore
hast
thou
also
taught
the
wicked
ones
thy
ways
also
in
thy
skirts
is
found
the
blood
of
the
souls
of
the
poor
innocents
i
have
not
found
it
by
secret
search
but
upon
all
these
yet
thou
sayest
because
i
am
innocent
surely
his
anger
shall
turn
from
me
behold
i
will
plead
with
thee
because
thou
sayest
i
have
not
sinned
why
gaddest
thou
about
so
much
to
change
thy
way
thou
also
shalt
be
ashamed
of
egypt
as
thou
wast
ashamed
of
assyria
yea
thou
shalt
go
forth
from
him
and
thine
hands
upon
thine
head
for
the
lord
hath
rejected
thy
confidences
and
thou
shalt
not
prosper
in
them
they
say
if
a
man
put
away
his
wife
and
she
go
from
him
and
become
another
man's
shall
he
return
unto
her
again
shall
not
that
land
be
greatly
polluted
but
thou
hast
played
the
harlot
with
many
lovers
yet
return
again
to
me
saith
the
lord
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
the
high
places
and
see
where
thou
hast
not
been
lien
with
in
the
ways
hast
thou
sat
for
them
as
the
arabian
in
the
wilderness
and
thou
hast
polluted
the
land
with
thy
whoredoms
and
with
thy
wickedness
therefore
the
showers
have
been
withholden
and
there
hath
been
no
latter
rain
and
thou
hadst
a
whore's
forehead
thou
refusedst
to
be
ashamed
wilt
thou
not
from
this
time
cry
unto
me
my
father
thou
art
the
guide
of
my
youth
will
he
reserve
his
anger
for
ever
will
he
keep
it
to
the
end
behold
thou
hast
spoken
and
done
evil
things
as
thou
couldest
the
lord
said
also
unto
me
in
the
days
of
josiah
the
king
hast
thou
seen
that
which
backsliding
israel
hath
done
she
is
gone
up
upon
every
high
mountain
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
hath
played
the
harlot
and
i
said
after
she
had
done
all
these
things
turn
thou
unto
me
but
she
returned
not
and
her
treacherous
sister
judah
saw
it
and
i
saw
when
for
all
the
causes
whereby
backsliding
israel
committed
adultery
i
had
put
her
away
and
given
her
a
bill
of
divorce
yet
her
treacherous
sister
judah
feared
not
but
went
and
played
the
harlot
also
and
it
came
to
pass
through
the
lightness
of
her
whoredom
that
she
defiled
the
land
and
committed
adultery
with
stones
and
with
stocks
and
yet
for
all
this
her
treacherous
sister
judah
hath
not
turned
unto
me
with
her
whole
heart
but
feignedly
saith
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
the
backsliding
israel
hath
justified
herself
more
than
treacherous
judah
go
and
proclaim
these
words
toward
the
north
and
say
return
thou
backsliding
israel
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
not
cause
mine
anger
to
fall
upon
you
for
i
am
merciful
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
not
keep
anger
for
ever
only
acknowledge
thine
iniquity
that
thou
hast
transgressed
against
the
lord
thy
god
and
hast
scattered
thy
ways
to
the
strangers
under
every
green
tree
and
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
saith
the
lord
turn
o
backsliding
children
saith
the
lord
for
i
am
married
unto
you
and
i
will
take
you
one
of
a
city
and
two
of
a
family
and
i
will
bring
you
to
zion
and
i
will
give
you
pastors
according
to
mine
heart
which
shall
feed
you
with
knowledge
and
understanding
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
ye
be
multiplied
and
increased
in
the
land
in
those
days
saith
the
lord
they
shall
say
no
more
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
neither
shall
it
come
to
mind
neither
shall
they
remember
it
neither
shall
they
visit
it
neither
shall
that
be
done
any
more
at
that
time
they
shall
call
jerusalem
the
throne
of
the
lord
and
all
the
nations
shall
be
gathered
unto
it
to
the
name
of
the
lord
to
jerusalem
neither
shall
they
walk
any
more
after
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
in
those
days
the
house
of
judah
shall
walk
with
the
house
of
israel
and
they
shall
come
together
out
of
the
land
of
the
north
to
the
land
that
i
have
given
for
an
inheritance
unto
your
fathers
but
i
said
how
shall
i
put
thee
among
the
children
and
give
thee
a
pleasant
land
a
goodly
heritage
of
the
hosts
of
nations
and
i
said
thou
shalt
call
me
my
father
and
shalt
not
turn
away
from
me
surely
as
a
wife
treacherously
departeth
from
her
husband
so
have
ye
dealt
treacherously
with
me
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
a
voice
was
heard
upon
the
high
places
weeping
and
supplications
of
the
children
of
israel
for
they
have
perverted
their
way
and
they
have
forgotten
the
lord
their
god
return
ye
backsliding
children
and
i
will
heal
your
backslidings
behold
we
come
unto
thee
for
thou
art
the
lord
our
god
truly
in
vain
is
salvation
hoped
for
from
the
hills
and
from
the
multitude
of
mountains
truly
in
the
lord
our
god
is
the
salvation
of
israel
for
shame
hath
devoured
the
labour
of
our
fathers
from
our
youth
their
flocks
and
their
herds
their
sons
and
their
daughters
we
lie
down
in
our
shame
and
our
confusion
covereth
us
for
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
our
god
we
and
our
fathers
from
our
youth
even
unto
this
day
and
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
if
thou
wilt
return
o
israel
saith
the
lord
return
unto
me
and
if
thou
wilt
put
away
thine
abominations
out
of
my
sight
then
shalt
thou
not
remove
and
thou
shalt
swear
the
lord
liveth
in
truth
in
judgment
and
in
righteousness
and
the
nations
shall
bless
themselves
in
him
and
in
him
shall
they
glory
for
thus
saith
the
lord
to
the
men
of
judah
and
jerusalem
break
up
your
fallow
ground
and
sow
not
among
thorns
circumcise
yourselves
to
the
lord
and
take
away
the
foreskins
of
your
heart
ye
men
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
lest
my
fury
come
forth
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
declare
ye
in
judah
and
publish
in
jerusalem
and
say
blow
ye
the
trumpet
in
the
land
cry
gather
together
and
say
assemble
yourselves
and
let
us
go
into
the
defenced
cities
set
up
the
standard
toward
zion
retire
stay
not
for
i
will
bring
evil
from
the
north
and
a
great
destruction
the
lion
is
come
up
from
his
thicket
and
the
destroyer
of
the
gentiles
is
on
his
way
he
is
gone
forth
from
his
place
to
make
thy
land
desolate
and
thy
cities
shall
be
laid
waste
without
an
inhabitant
for
this
gird
you
with
sackcloth
lament
and
howl
for
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
is
not
turned
back
from
us
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
at
that
day
saith
the
lord
that
the
heart
of
the
king
shall
perish
and
the
heart
of
the
princes
and
the
priests
shall
be
astonished
and
the
prophets
shall
wonder
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
surely
thou
hast
greatly
deceived
this
people
and
jerusalem
saying
ye
shall
have
peace
whereas
the
sword
reacheth
unto
the
soul
at
that
time
shall
it
be
said
to
this
people
and
to
jerusalem
a
dry
wind
of
the
high
places
in
the
wilderness
toward
the
daughter
of
my
people
not
to
fan
nor
to
cleanse
even
a
full
wind
from
those
places
shall
come
unto
me
now
also
will
i
give
sentence
against
them
behold
he
shall
come
up
as
clouds
and
his
chariots
shall
be
as
a
whirlwind
his
horses
are
swifter
than
eagles
woe
unto
us
for
we
are
spoiled
o
jerusalem
wash
thine
heart
from
wickedness
that
thou
mayest
be
saved
how
long
shall
thy
vain
thoughts
lodge
within
thee
for
a
voice
declareth
from
dan
and
publisheth
affliction
from
mount
ephraim
make
ye
mention
to
the
nations
behold
publish
against
jerusalem
that
watchers
come
from
a
far
country
and
give
out
their
voice
against
the
cities
of
judah
as
keepers
of
a
field
are
they
against
her
round
about
because
she
hath
been
rebellious
against
me
saith
the
lord
thy
way
and
thy
doings
have
procured
these
things
unto
thee
this
is
thy
wickedness
because
it
is
bitter
because
it
reacheth
unto
thine
heart
my
bowels
my
bowels
i
am
pained
at
my
very
heart
my
heart
maketh
a
noise
in
me
i
cannot
hold
my
peace
because
thou
hast
heard
o
my
soul
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
alarm
of
war
destruction
upon
destruction
is
cried
for
the
whole
land
is
spoiled
suddenly
are
my
tents
spoiled
and
my
curtains
in
a
moment
how
long
shall
i
see
the
standard
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
for
my
people
is
foolish
they
have
not
known
me
they
are
sottish
children
and
they
have
none
understanding
they
are
wise
to
do
evil
but
to
do
good
they
have
no
knowledge
i
beheld
the
earth
and
lo
it
was
without
form
and
void
and
the
heavens
and
they
had
no
light
i
beheld
the
mountains
and
lo
they
trembled
and
all
the
hills
moved
lightly
i
beheld
and
lo
there
was
no
man
and
all
the
birds
of
the
heavens
were
fled
i
beheld
and
lo
the
fruitful
place
was
a
wilderness
and
all
the
cities
thereof
were
broken
down
at
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
by
his
fierce
anger
for
thus
hath
the
lord
said
the
whole
land
shall
be
desolate
yet
will
i
not
make
a
full
end
for
this
shall
the
earth
mourn
and
the
heavens
above
be
black
because
i
have
spoken
it
i
have
purposed
it
and
will
not
repent
neither
will
i
turn
back
from
it
the
whole
city
shall
flee
for
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
and
bowmen
they
shall
go
into
thickets
and
climb
up
upon
the
rocks
every
city
shall
be
forsaken
and
not
a
man
dwell
therein
and
when
thou
art
spoiled
what
wilt
thou
do
though
thou
clothest
thyself
with
crimson
though
thou
deckest
thee
with
ornaments
of
gold
though
thou
rentest
thy
face
with
painting
in
vain
shalt
thou
make
thyself
fair
thy
lovers
will
despise
thee
they
will
seek
thy
life
for
i
have
heard
a
voice
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
and
the
anguish
as
of
her
that
bringeth
forth
her
first
child
the
voice
of
the
daughter
of
zion
that
bewaileth
herself
that
spreadeth
her
hands
saying
woe
is
me
now
for
my
soul
is
wearied
because
of
murderers
run
ye
to
and
fro
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
see
now
and
know
and
seek
in
the
broad
places
thereof
if
ye
can
find
a
man
if
there
be
any
that
executeth
judgment
that
seeketh
the
truth
and
i
will
pardon
it
and
though
they
say
the
lord
liveth
surely
they
swear
falsely
o
lord
are
not
thine
eyes
upon
the
truth
thou
hast
stricken
them
but
they
have
not
grieved
thou
hast
consumed
them
but
they
have
refused
to
receive
correction
they
have
made
their
faces
harder
than
a
rock
they
have
refused
to
return
therefore
i
said
surely
these
are
poor
they
are
foolish
for
they
know
not
the
way
of
the
lord
nor
the
judgment
of
their
god
i
will
get
me
unto
the
great
men
and
will
speak
unto
them
for
they
have
known
the
way
of
the
lord
and
the
judgment
of
their
god
but
these
have
altogether
broken
the
yoke
and
burst
the
bonds
wherefore
a
lion
out
of
the
forest
shall
slay
them
and
a
wolf
of
the
evenings
shall
spoil
them
a
leopard
shall
watch
over
their
cities
every
one
that
goeth
out
thence
shall
be
torn
in
pieces
because
their
transgressions
are
many
and
their
backslidings
are
increased
how
shall
i
pardon
thee
for
this
thy
children
have
forsaken
me
and
sworn
by
them
that
are
no
gods
when
i
had
fed
them
to
the
full
they
then
committed
adultery
and
assembled
themselves
by
troops
in
the
harlots
houses
they
were
as
fed
horses
in
the
morning
every
one
neighed
after
his
neighbour's
wife
shall
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
and
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
go
ye
up
upon
her
walls
and
destroy
but
make
not
a
full
end
take
away
her
battlements
for
they
are
not
the
lord's
for
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
have
dealt
very
treacherously
against
me
saith
the
lord
they
have
belied
the
lord
and
said
it
is
not
he
neither
shall
evil
come
upon
us
neither
shall
we
see
sword
nor
famine
and
the
prophets
shall
become
wind
and
the
word
is
not
in
them
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
them
wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
because
ye
speak
this
word
behold
i
will
make
my
words
in
thy
mouth
fire
and
this
people
wood
and
it
shall
devour
them
lo
i
will
bring
a
nation
upon
you
from
far
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord
it
is
a
mighty
nation
it
is
an
ancient
nation
a
nation
whose
language
thou
knowest
not
neither
understandest
what
they
say
their
quiver
is
as
an
open
sepulchre
they
are
all
mighty
men
and
they
shall
eat
up
thine
harvest
and
thy
bread
which
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
should
eat
they
shall
eat
up
thy
flocks
and
thine
herds
they
shall
eat
up
thy
vines
and
thy
fig
trees
they
shall
impoverish
thy
fenced
cities
wherein
thou
trustedst
with
the
sword
nevertheless
in
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
make
a
full
end
with
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
ye
shall
say
wherefore
doeth
the
lord
our
god
all
these
things
unto
us
then
shalt
thou
answer
them
like
as
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
served
strange
gods
in
your
land
so
shall
ye
serve
strangers
in
a
land
that
is
not
your's
declare
this
in
the
house
of
jacob
and
publish
it
in
judah
saying
hear
now
this
o
foolish
people
and
without
understanding
which
have
eyes
and
see
not
which
have
ears
and
hear
not
fear
ye
not
me
saith
the
lord
will
ye
not
tremble
at
my
presence
which
have
placed
the
sand
for
the
bound
of
the
sea
by
a
perpetual
decree
that
it
cannot
pass
it
and
though
the
waves
thereof
toss
themselves
yet
can
they
not
prevail
though
they
roar
yet
can
they
not
pass
over
it
but
this
people
hath
a
revolting
and
a
rebellious
heart
they
are
revolted
and
gone
neither
say
they
in
their
heart
let
us
now
fear
the
lord
our
god
that
giveth
rain
both
the
former
and
the
latter
in
his
season
he
reserveth
unto
us
the
appointed
weeks
of
the
harvest
your
iniquities
have
turned
away
these
things
and
your
sins
have
withholden
good
things
from
you
for
among
my
people
are
found
wicked
men
they
lay
wait
as
he
that
setteth
snares
they
set
a
trap
they
catch
men
as
a
cage
is
full
of
birds
so
are
their
houses
full
of
deceit
therefore
they
are
become
great
and
waxen
rich
they
are
waxen
fat
they
shine
yea
they
overpass
the
deeds
of
the
wicked
they
judge
not
the
cause
the
cause
of
the
fatherless
yet
they
prosper
and
the
right
of
the
needy
do
they
not
judge
shall
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
a
wonderful
and
horrible
thing
is
committed
in
the
land
the
prophets
prophesy
falsely
and
the
priests
bear
rule
by
their
means
and
my
people
love
to
have
it
so
and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
end
thereof
o
ye
children
of
benjamin
gather
yourselves
to
flee
out
of
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
blow
the
trumpet
in
tekoa
and
set
up
a
sign
of
fire
in
bethhaccerem
for
evil
appeareth
out
of
the
north
and
great
destruction
i
have
likened
the
daughter
of
zion
to
a
comely
and
delicate
woman
the
shepherds
with
their
flocks
shall
come
unto
her
they
shall
pitch
their
tents
against
her
round
about
they
shall
feed
every
one
in
his
place
prepare
ye
war
against
her
arise
and
let
us
go
up
at
noon
woe
unto
us
for
the
day
goeth
away
for
the
shadows
of
the
evening
are
stretched
out
arise
and
let
us
go
by
night
and
let
us
destroy
her
palaces
for
thus
hath
the
lord
of
hosts
said
hew
ye
down
trees
and
cast
a
mount
against
jerusalem
this
is
the
city
to
be
visited
she
is
wholly
oppression
in
the
midst
of
her
as
a
fountain
casteth
out
her
waters
so
she
casteth
out
her
wickedness
violence
and
spoil
is
heard
in
her
before
me
continually
is
grief
and
wounds
be
thou
instructed
o
jerusalem
lest
my
soul
depart
from
thee
lest
i
make
thee
desolate
a
land
not
inhabited
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
they
shall
throughly
glean
the
remnant
of
israel
as
a
vine
turn
back
thine
hand
as
a
grapegatherer
into
the
baskets
to
whom
shall
i
speak
and
give
warning
that
they
may
hear
behold
their
ear
is
uncircumcised
and
they
cannot
hearken
behold
the
word
of
the
lord
is
unto
them
a
reproach
they
have
no
delight
in
it
therefore
i
am
full
of
the
fury
of
the
lord
i
am
weary
with
holding
in
i
will
pour
it
out
upon
the
children
abroad
and
upon
the
assembly
of
young
men
together
for
even
the
husband
with
the
wife
shall
be
taken
the
aged
with
him
that
is
full
of
days
and
their
houses
shall
be
turned
unto
others
with
their
fields
and
wives
together
for
i
will
stretch
out
my
hand
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
saith
the
lord
for
from
the
least
of
them
even
unto
the
greatest
of
them
every
one
is
given
to
covetousness
and
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely
they
have
healed
also
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly
saying
peace
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination
nay
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed
neither
could
they
blush
therefore
they
shall
fall
among
them
that
fall
at
the
time
that
i
visit
them
they
shall
be
cast
down
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
stand
ye
in
the
ways
and
see
and
ask
for
the
old
paths
where
is
the
good
way
and
walk
therein
and
ye
shall
find
rest
for
your
souls
but
they
said
we
will
not
walk
therein
also
i
set
watchmen
over
you
saying
hearken
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
but
they
said
we
will
not
hearken
therefore
hear
ye
nations
and
know
o
congregation
what
is
among
them
hear
o
earth
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
people
even
the
fruit
of
their
thoughts
because
they
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
words
nor
to
my
law
but
rejected
it
to
what
purpose
cometh
there
to
me
incense
from
sheba
and
the
sweet
cane
from
a
far
country
your
burnt
offerings
are
not
acceptable
nor
your
sacrifices
sweet
unto
me
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
lay
stumblingblocks
before
this
people
and
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together
shall
fall
upon
them
the
neighbour
and
his
friend
shall
perish
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
a
people
cometh
from
the
north
country
and
a
great
nation
shall
be
raised
from
the
sides
of
the
earth
they
shall
lay
hold
on
bow
and
spear
they
are
cruel
and
have
no
mercy
their
voice
roareth
like
the
sea
and
they
ride
upon
horses
set
in
array
as
men
for
war
against
thee
o
daughter
of
zion
we
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
our
hands
wax
feeble
anguish
hath
taken
hold
of
us
and
pain
as
of
a
woman
in
travail
go
not
forth
into
the
field
nor
walk
by
the
way
for
the
sword
of
the
enemy
and
fear
is
on
every
side
o
daughter
of
my
people
gird
thee
with
sackcloth
and
wallow
thyself
in
ashes
make
thee
mourning
as
for
an
only
son
most
bitter
lamentation
for
the
spoiler
shall
suddenly
come
upon
us
i
have
set
thee
for
a
tower
and
a
fortress
among
my
people
that
thou
mayest
know
and
try
their
way
they
are
all
grievous
revolters
walking
with
slanders
they
are
brass
and
iron
they
are
all
corrupters
the
bellows
are
burned
the
lead
is
consumed
of
the
fire
the
founder
melteth
in
vain
for
the
wicked
are
not
plucked
away
reprobate
silver
shall
men
call
them
because
the
lord
hath
rejected
them
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
lord's
house
and
proclaim
there
this
word
and
say
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
all
ye
of
judah
that
enter
in
at
these
gates
to
worship
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
and
i
will
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place
trust
ye
not
in
lying
words
saying
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
are
these
for
if
ye
throughly
amend
your
ways
and
your
doings
if
ye
throughly
execute
judgment
between
a
man
and
his
neighbour
if
ye
oppress
not
the
stranger
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
and
shed
not
innocent
blood
in
this
place
neither
walk
after
other
gods
to
your
hurt
then
will
i
cause
you
to
dwell
in
this
place
in
the
land
that
i
gave
to
your
fathers
for
ever
and
ever
behold
ye
trust
in
lying
words
that
cannot
profit
will
ye
steal
murder
and
commit
adultery
and
swear
falsely
and
burn
incense
unto
baal
and
walk
after
other
gods
whom
ye
know
not
and
come
and
stand
before
me
in
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
and
say
we
are
delivered
to
do
all
these
abominations
is
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
become
a
den
of
robbers
in
your
eyes
behold
even
i
have
seen
it
saith
the
lord
but
go
ye
now
unto
my
place
which
was
in
shiloh
where
i
set
my
name
at
the
first
and
see
what
i
did
to
it
for
the
wickedness
of
my
people
israel
and
now
because
ye
have
done
all
these
works
saith
the
lord
and
i
spake
unto
you
rising
up
early
and
speaking
but
ye
heard
not
and
i
called
you
but
ye
answered
not
therefore
will
i
do
unto
this
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
wherein
ye
trust
and
unto
the
place
which
i
gave
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
as
i
have
done
to
shiloh
and
i
will
cast
you
out
of
my
sight
as
i
have
cast
out
all
your
brethren
even
the
whole
seed
of
ephraim
therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
up
cry
nor
prayer
for
them
neither
make
intercession
to
me
for
i
will
not
hear
thee
seest
thou
not
what
they
do
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
the
children
gather
wood
and
the
fathers
kindle
the
fire
and
the
women
knead
their
dough
to
make
cakes
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
unto
other
gods
that
they
may
provoke
me
to
anger
do
they
provoke
me
to
anger
saith
the
lord
do
they
not
provoke
themselves
to
the
confusion
of
their
own
faces
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
mine
anger
and
my
fury
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place
upon
man
and
upon
beast
and
upon
the
trees
of
the
field
and
upon
the
fruit
of
the
ground
and
it
shall
burn
and
shall
not
be
quenched
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
put
your
burnt
offerings
unto
your
sacrifices
and
eat
flesh
for
i
spake
not
unto
your
fathers
nor
commanded
them
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
concerning
burnt
offerings
or
sacrifices
but
this
thing
commanded
i
them
saying
obey
my
voice
and
i
will
be
your
god
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
walk
ye
in
all
the
ways
that
i
have
commanded
you
that
it
may
be
well
unto
you
but
they
hearkened
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
in
the
counsels
and
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
and
went
backward
and
not
forward
since
the
day
that
your
fathers
came
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
unto
this
day
i
have
even
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
daily
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
yet
they
hearkened
not
unto
me
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
hardened
their
neck
they
did
worse
than
their
fathers
therefore
thou
shalt
speak
all
these
words
unto
them
but
they
will
not
hearken
to
thee
thou
shalt
also
call
unto
them
but
they
will
not
answer
thee
but
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
this
is
a
nation
that
obeyeth
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
nor
receiveth
correction
truth
is
perished
and
is
cut
off
from
their
mouth
cut
off
thine
hair
o
jerusalem
and
cast
it
away
and
take
up
a
lamentation
on
high
places
for
the
lord
hath
rejected
and
forsaken
the
generation
of
his
wrath
for
the
children
of
judah
have
done
evil
in
my
sight
saith
the
lord
they
have
set
their
abominations
in
the
house
which
is
called
by
my
name
to
pollute
it
and
they
have
built
the
high
places
of
tophet
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
to
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
fire
which
i
commanded
them
not
neither
came
it
into
my
heart
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
it
shall
no
more
be
called
tophet
nor
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
but
the
valley
of
slaughter
for
they
shall
bury
in
tophet
till
there
be
no
place
and
the
carcases
of
this
people
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
none
shall
fray
them
away
then
will
i
cause
to
cease
from
the
cities
of
judah
and
from
the
streets
of
jerusalem
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
for
the
land
shall
be
desolate
at
that
time
saith
the
lord
they
shall
bring
out
the
bones
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
the
bones
of
his
princes
and
the
bones
of
the
priests
and
the
bones
of
the
prophets
and
the
bones
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
out
of
their
graves
and
they
shall
spread
them
before
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
whom
they
have
loved
and
whom
they
have
served
and
after
whom
they
have
walked
and
whom
they
have
sought
and
whom
they
have
worshipped
they
shall
not
be
gathered
nor
be
buried
they
shall
be
for
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
death
shall
be
chosen
rather
than
life
by
all
the
residue
of
them
that
remain
of
this
evil
family
which
remain
in
all
the
places
whither
i
have
driven
them
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
moreover
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
shall
they
fall
and
not
arise
shall
he
turn
away
and
not
return
why
then
is
this
people
of
jerusalem
slidden
back
by
a
perpetual
backsliding
they
hold
fast
deceit
they
refuse
to
return
i
hearkened
and
heard
but
they
spake
not
aright
no
man
repented
him
of
his
wickedness
saying
what
have
i
done
every
one
turned
to
his
course
as
the
horse
rusheth
into
the
battle
yea
the
stork
in
the
heaven
knoweth
her
appointed
times
and
the
turtle
and
the
crane
and
the
swallow
observe
the
time
of
their
coming
but
my
people
know
not
the
judgment
of
the
lord
how
do
ye
say
we
are
wise
and
the
law
of
the
lord
is
with
us
lo
certainly
in
vain
made
he
it
the
pen
of
the
scribes
is
in
vain
the
wise
men
are
ashamed
they
are
dismayed
and
taken
lo
they
have
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
and
what
wisdom
is
in
them
therefore
will
i
give
their
wives
unto
others
and
their
fields
to
them
that
shall
inherit
them
for
every
one
from
the
least
even
unto
the
greatest
is
given
to
covetousness
from
the
prophet
even
unto
the
priest
every
one
dealeth
falsely
for
they
have
healed
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
slightly
saying
peace
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
were
they
ashamed
when
they
had
committed
abomination
nay
they
were
not
at
all
ashamed
neither
could
they
blush
therefore
shall
they
fall
among
them
that
fall
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
be
cast
down
saith
the
lord
i
will
surely
consume
them
saith
the
lord
there
shall
be
no
grapes
on
the
vine
nor
figs
on
the
fig
tree
and
the
leaf
shall
fade
and
the
things
that
i
have
given
them
shall
pass
away
from
them
why
do
we
sit
still
assemble
yourselves
and
let
us
enter
into
the
defenced
cities
and
let
us
be
silent
there
for
the
lord
our
god
hath
put
us
to
silence
and
given
us
water
of
gall
to
drink
because
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
we
looked
for
peace
but
no
good
came
and
for
a
time
of
health
and
behold
trouble
the
snorting
of
his
horses
was
heard
from
dan
the
whole
land
trembled
at
the
sound
of
the
neighing
of
his
strong
ones
for
they
are
come
and
have
devoured
the
land
and
all
that
is
in
it
the
city
and
those
that
dwell
therein
for
behold
i
will
send
serpents
cockatrices
among
you
which
will
not
be
charmed
and
they
shall
bite
you
saith
the
lord
when
i
would
comfort
myself
against
sorrow
my
heart
is
faint
in
me
behold
the
voice
of
the
cry
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
because
of
them
that
dwell
in
a
far
country
is
not
the
lord
in
zion
is
not
her
king
in
her
why
have
they
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
graven
images
and
with
strange
vanities
the
harvest
is
past
the
summer
is
ended
and
we
are
not
saved
for
the
hurt
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
am
i
hurt
i
am
black
astonishment
hath
taken
hold
on
me
is
there
no
balm
in
gilead
is
there
no
physician
there
why
then
is
not
the
health
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
recovered
oh
that
my
head
were
waters
and
mine
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears
that
i
might
weep
day
and
night
for
the
slain
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
oh
that
i
had
in
the
wilderness
a
lodging
place
of
wayfaring
men
that
i
might
leave
my
people
and
go
from
them
for
they
be
all
adulterers
an
assembly
of
treacherous
men
and
they
bend
their
tongues
like
their
bow
for
lies
but
they
are
not
valiant
for
the
truth
upon
the
earth
for
they
proceed
from
evil
to
evil
and
they
know
not
me
saith
the
lord
take
ye
heed
every
one
of
his
neighbour
and
trust
ye
not
in
any
brother
for
every
brother
will
utterly
supplant
and
every
neighbour
will
walk
with
slanders
and
they
will
deceive
every
one
his
neighbour
and
will
not
speak
the
truth
they
have
taught
their
tongue
to
speak
lies
and
weary
themselves
to
commit
iniquity
thine
habitation
is
in
the
midst
of
deceit
through
deceit
they
refuse
to
know
me
saith
the
lord
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
melt
them
and
try
them
for
how
shall
i
do
for
the
daughter
of
my
people
their
tongue
is
as
an
arrow
shot
out
it
speaketh
deceit
one
speaketh
peaceably
to
his
neighbour
with
his
mouth
but
in
heart
he
layeth
his
wait
shall
i
not
visit
them
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
for
the
mountains
will
i
take
up
a
weeping
and
wailing
and
for
the
habitations
of
the
wilderness
a
lamentation
because
they
are
burned
up
so
that
none
can
pass
through
them
neither
can
men
hear
the
voice
of
the
cattle
both
the
fowl
of
the
heavens
and
the
beast
are
fled
they
are
gone
and
i
will
make
jerusalem
heaps
and
a
den
of
dragons
and
i
will
make
the
cities
of
judah
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
who
is
the
wise
man
that
may
understand
this
and
who
is
he
to
whom
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
that
he
may
declare
it
for
what
the
land
perisheth
and
is
burned
up
like
a
wilderness
that
none
passeth
through
and
the
lord
saith
because
they
have
forsaken
my
law
which
i
set
before
them
and
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
neither
walked
therein
but
have
walked
after
the
imagination
of
their
own
heart
and
after
baalim
which
their
fathers
taught
them
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
feed
them
even
this
people
with
wormwood
and
give
them
water
of
gall
to
drink
i
will
scatter
them
also
among
the
heathen
whom
neither
they
nor
their
fathers
have
known
and
i
will
send
a
sword
after
them
till
i
have
consumed
them
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
consider
ye
and
call
for
the
mourning
women
that
they
may
come
and
send
for
cunning
women
that
they
may
come
and
let
them
make
haste
and
take
up
a
wailing
for
us
that
our
eyes
may
run
down
with
tears
and
our
eyelids
gush
out
with
waters
for
a
voice
of
wailing
is
heard
out
of
zion
how
are
we
spoiled
we
are
greatly
confounded
because
we
have
forsaken
the
land
because
our
dwellings
have
cast
us
out
yet
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
o
ye
women
and
let
your
ear
receive
the
word
of
his
mouth
and
teach
your
daughters
wailing
and
every
one
her
neighbour
lamentation
for
death
is
come
up
into
our
windows
and
is
entered
into
our
palaces
to
cut
off
the
children
from
without
and
the
young
men
from
the
streets
speak
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
carcases
of
men
shall
fall
as
dung
upon
the
open
field
and
as
the
handful
after
the
harvestman
and
none
shall
gather
them
thus
saith
the
lord
let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches
but
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me
that
i
am
the
lord
which
exercise
lovingkindness
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
earth
for
in
these
things
i
delight
saith
the
lord
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
punish
all
them
which
are
circumcised
with
the
uncircumcised
egypt
and
judah
and
edom
and
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
and
all
that
are
in
the
utmost
corners
that
dwell
in
the
wilderness
for
all
these
nations
are
uncircumcised
and
all
the
house
of
israel
are
uncircumcised
in
the
heart
hear
ye
the
word
which
the
lord
speaketh
unto
you
o
house
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
learn
not
the
way
of
the
heathen
and
be
not
dismayed
at
the
signs
of
heaven
for
the
heathen
are
dismayed
at
them
for
the
customs
of
the
people
are
vain
for
one
cutteth
a
tree
out
of
the
forest
the
work
of
the
hands
of
the
workman
with
the
axe
they
deck
it
with
silver
and
with
gold
they
fasten
it
with
nails
and
with
hammers
that
it
move
not
they
are
upright
as
the
palm
tree
but
speak
not
they
must
needs
be
borne
because
they
cannot
go
be
not
afraid
of
them
for
they
cannot
do
evil
neither
also
is
it
in
them
to
do
good
forasmuch
as
there
is
none
like
unto
thee
o
lord
thou
art
great
and
thy
name
is
great
in
might
who
would
not
fear
thee
o
king
of
nations
for
to
thee
doth
it
appertain
forasmuch
as
among
all
the
wise
men
of
the
nations
and
in
all
their
kingdoms
there
is
none
like
unto
thee
but
they
are
altogether
brutish
and
foolish
the
stock
is
a
doctrine
of
vanities
silver
spread
into
plates
is
brought
from
tarshish
and
gold
from
uphaz
the
work
of
the
workman
and
of
the
hands
of
the
founder
blue
and
purple
is
their
clothing
they
are
all
the
work
of
cunning
men
but
the
lord
is
the
true
god
he
is
the
living
god
and
an
everlasting
king
at
his
wrath
the
earth
shall
tremble
and
the
nations
shall
not
be
able
to
abide
his
indignation
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
them
the
gods
that
have
not
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
even
they
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
from
under
these
heavens
he
hath
made
the
earth
by
his
power
he
hath
established
the
world
by
his
wisdom
and
hath
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
his
discretion
when
he
uttereth
his
voice
there
is
a
multitude
of
waters
in
the
heavens
and
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain
and
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures
every
man
is
brutish
in
his
knowledge
every
founder
is
confounded
by
the
graven
image
for
his
molten
image
is
falsehood
and
there
is
no
breath
in
them
they
are
vanity
and
the
work
of
errors
in
the
time
of
their
visitation
they
shall
perish
the
portion
of
jacob
is
not
like
them
for
he
is
the
former
of
all
things
and
israel
is
the
rod
of
his
inheritance
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
gather
up
thy
wares
out
of
the
land
o
inhabitant
of
the
fortress
for
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
sling
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
at
this
once
and
will
distress
them
that
they
may
find
it
so
woe
is
me
for
my
hurt
my
wound
is
grievous
but
i
said
truly
this
is
a
grief
and
i
must
bear
it
my
tabernacle
is
spoiled
and
all
my
cords
are
broken
my
children
are
gone
forth
of
me
and
they
are
not
there
is
none
to
stretch
forth
my
tent
any
more
and
to
set
up
my
curtains
for
the
pastors
are
become
brutish
and
have
not
sought
the
lord
therefore
they
shall
not
prosper
and
all
their
flocks
shall
be
scattered
behold
the
noise
of
the
bruit
is
come
and
a
great
commotion
out
of
the
north
country
to
make
the
cities
of
judah
desolate
and
a
den
of
dragons
o
lord
i
know
that
the
way
of
man
is
not
in
himself
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
steps
o
lord
correct
me
but
with
judgment
not
in
thine
anger
lest
thou
bring
me
to
nothing
pour
out
thy
fury
upon
the
heathen
that
know
thee
not
and
upon
the
families
that
call
not
on
thy
name
for
they
have
eaten
up
jacob
and
devoured
him
and
consumed
him
and
have
made
his
habitation
desolate
the
word
that
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
speak
unto
the
men
of
judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
say
thou
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
cursed
be
the
man
that
obeyeth
not
the
words
of
this
covenant
which
i
commanded
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
iron
furnace
saying
obey
my
voice
and
do
them
according
to
all
which
i
command
you
so
shall
ye
be
my
people
and
i
will
be
your
god
that
i
may
perform
the
oath
which
i
have
sworn
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
as
it
is
this
day
then
answered
i
and
said
so
be
it
o
lord
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
proclaim
all
these
words
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
do
them
for
i
earnestly
protested
unto
your
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
rising
early
and
protesting
saying
obey
my
voice
yet
they
obeyed
not
nor
inclined
their
ear
but
walked
every
one
in
the
imagination
of
their
evil
heart
therefore
i
will
bring
upon
them
all
the
words
of
this
covenant
which
i
commanded
them
to
do
but
they
did
them
not
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
a
conspiracy
is
found
among
the
men
of
judah
and
among
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
they
are
turned
back
to
the
iniquities
of
their
forefathers
which
refused
to
hear
my
words
and
they
went
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
the
house
of
israel
and
the
house
of
judah
have
broken
my
covenant
which
i
made
with
their
fathers
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
them
which
they
shall
not
be
able
to
escape
and
though
they
shall
cry
unto
me
i
will
not
hearken
unto
them
then
shall
the
cities
of
judah
and
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
unto
whom
they
offer
incense
but
they
shall
not
save
them
at
all
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
for
according
to
the
number
of
thy
cities
were
thy
gods
o
judah
and
according
to
the
number
of
the
streets
of
jerusalem
have
ye
set
up
altars
to
that
shameful
thing
even
altars
to
burn
incense
unto
baal
therefore
pray
not
thou
for
this
people
neither
lift
up
a
cry
or
prayer
for
them
for
i
will
not
hear
them
in
the
time
that
they
cry
unto
me
for
their
trouble
what
hath
my
beloved
to
do
in
mine
house
seeing
she
hath
wrought
lewdness
with
many
and
the
holy
flesh
is
passed
from
thee
when
thou
doest
evil
then
thou
rejoicest
the
lord
called
thy
name
a
green
olive
tree
fair
and
of
goodly
fruit
with
the
noise
of
a
great
tumult
he
hath
kindled
fire
upon
it
and
the
branches
of
it
are
broken
for
the
lord
of
hosts
that
planted
thee
hath
pronounced
evil
against
thee
for
the
evil
of
the
house
of
israel
and
of
the
house
of
judah
which
they
have
done
against
themselves
to
provoke
me
to
anger
in
offering
incense
unto
baal
and
the
lord
hath
given
me
knowledge
of
it
and
i
know
it
then
thou
shewedst
me
their
doings
but
i
was
like
a
lamb
or
an
ox
that
is
brought
to
the
slaughter
and
i
knew
not
that
they
had
devised
devices
against
me
saying
let
us
destroy
the
tree
with
the
fruit
thereof
and
let
us
cut
him
off
from
the
land
of
the
living
that
his
name
may
be
no
more
remembered
but
o
lord
of
hosts
that
judgest
righteously
that
triest
the
reins
and
the
heart
let
me
see
thy
vengeance
on
them
for
unto
thee
have
i
revealed
my
cause
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
the
men
of
anathoth
that
seek
thy
life
saying
prophesy
not
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
thou
die
not
by
our
hand
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
behold
i
will
punish
them
the
young
men
shall
die
by
the
sword
their
sons
and
their
daughters
shall
die
by
famine
and
there
shall
be
no
remnant
of
them
for
i
will
bring
evil
upon
the
men
of
anathoth
even
the
year
of
their
visitation
righteous
art
thou
o
lord
when
i
plead
with
thee
yet
let
me
talk
with
thee
of
thy
judgments
wherefore
doth
the
way
of
the
wicked
prosper
wherefore
are
all
they
happy
that
deal
very
treacherously
thou
hast
planted
them
yea
they
have
taken
root
they
grow
yea
they
bring
forth
fruit
thou
art
near
in
their
mouth
and
far
from
their
reins
but
thou
o
lord
knowest
me
thou
hast
seen
me
and
tried
mine
heart
toward
thee
pull
them
out
like
sheep
for
the
slaughter
and
prepare
them
for
the
day
of
slaughter
how
long
shall
the
land
mourn
and
the
herbs
of
every
field
wither
for
the
wickedness
of
them
that
dwell
therein
the
beasts
are
consumed
and
the
birds
because
they
said
he
shall
not
see
our
last
end
if
thou
hast
run
with
the
footmen
and
they
have
wearied
thee
then
how
canst
thou
contend
with
horses
and
if
in
the
land
of
peace
wherein
thou
trustedst
they
wearied
thee
then
how
wilt
thou
do
in
the
swelling
of
jordan
for
even
thy
brethren
and
the
house
of
thy
father
even
they
have
dealt
treacherously
with
thee
yea
they
have
called
a
multitude
after
thee
believe
them
not
though
they
speak
fair
words
unto
thee
i
have
forsaken
mine
house
i
have
left
mine
heritage
i
have
given
the
dearly
beloved
of
my
soul
into
the
hand
of
her
enemies
mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
lion
in
the
forest
it
crieth
out
against
me
therefore
have
i
hated
it
mine
heritage
is
unto
me
as
a
speckled
bird
the
birds
round
about
are
against
her
come
ye
assemble
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
come
to
devour
many
pastors
have
destroyed
my
vineyard
they
have
trodden
my
portion
under
foot
they
have
made
my
pleasant
portion
a
desolate
wilderness
they
have
made
it
desolate
and
being
desolate
it
mourneth
unto
me
the
whole
land
is
made
desolate
because
no
man
layeth
it
to
heart
the
spoilers
are
come
upon
all
high
places
through
the
wilderness
for
the
sword
of
the
lord
shall
devour
from
the
one
end
of
the
land
even
to
the
other
end
of
the
land
no
flesh
shall
have
peace
they
have
sown
wheat
but
shall
reap
thorns
they
have
put
themselves
to
pain
but
shall
not
profit
and
they
shall
be
ashamed
of
your
revenues
because
of
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
against
all
mine
evil
neighbours
that
touch
the
inheritance
which
i
have
caused
my
people
israel
to
inherit
behold
i
will
pluck
them
out
of
their
land
and
pluck
out
the
house
of
judah
from
among
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
after
that
i
have
plucked
them
out
i
will
return
and
have
compassion
on
them
and
will
bring
them
again
every
man
to
his
heritage
and
every
man
to
his
land
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
to
swear
by
my
name
the
lord
liveth
as
they
taught
my
people
to
swear
by
baal
then
shall
they
be
built
in
the
midst
of
my
people
but
if
they
will
not
obey
i
will
utterly
pluck
up
and
destroy
that
nation
saith
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
me
go
and
get
thee
a
linen
girdle
and
put
it
upon
thy
loins
and
put
it
not
in
water
so
i
got
a
girdle
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
put
it
on
my
loins
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
the
second
time
saying
take
the
girdle
that
thou
hast
got
which
is
upon
thy
loins
and
arise
go
to
euphrates
and
hide
it
there
in
a
hole
of
the
rock
so
i
went
and
hid
it
by
euphrates
as
the
lord
commanded
me
and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
go
to
euphrates
and
take
the
girdle
from
thence
which
i
commanded
thee
to
hide
there
then
i
went
to
euphrates
and
digged
and
took
the
girdle
from
the
place
where
i
had
hid
it
and
behold
the
girdle
was
marred
it
was
profitable
for
nothing
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
after
this
manner
will
i
mar
the
pride
of
judah
and
the
great
pride
of
jerusalem
this
evil
people
which
refuse
to
hear
my
words
which
walk
in
the
imagination
of
their
heart
and
walk
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
worship
them
shall
even
be
as
this
girdle
which
is
good
for
nothing
for
as
the
girdle
cleaveth
to
the
loins
of
a
man
so
have
i
caused
to
cleave
unto
me
the
whole
house
of
israel
and
the
whole
house
of
judah
saith
the
lord
that
they
might
be
unto
me
for
a
people
and
for
a
name
and
for
a
praise
and
for
a
glory
but
they
would
not
hear
therefore
thou
shalt
speak
unto
them
this
word
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
do
we
not
certainly
know
that
every
bottle
shall
be
filled
with
wine
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
fill
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
even
the
kings
that
sit
upon
david's
throne
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
with
drunkenness
and
i
will
dash
them
one
against
another
even
the
fathers
and
the
sons
together
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
pity
nor
spare
nor
have
mercy
but
destroy
them
hear
ye
and
give
ear
be
not
proud
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
give
glory
to
the
lord
your
god
before
he
cause
darkness
and
before
your
feet
stumble
upon
the
dark
mountains
and
while
ye
look
for
light
he
turn
it
into
the
shadow
of
death
and
make
it
gross
darkness
but
if
ye
will
not
hear
it
my
soul
shall
weep
in
secret
places
for
your
pride
and
mine
eye
shall
weep
sore
and
run
down
with
tears
because
the
lord's
flock
is
carried
away
captive
say
unto
the
king
and
to
the
queen
humble
yourselves
sit
down
for
your
principalities
shall
come
down
even
the
crown
of
your
glory
the
cities
of
the
south
shall
be
shut
up
and
none
shall
open
them
judah
shall
be
carried
away
captive
all
of
it
it
shall
be
wholly
carried
away
captive
lift
up
your
eyes
and
behold
them
that
come
from
the
north
where
is
the
flock
that
was
given
thee
thy
beautiful
flock
what
wilt
thou
say
when
he
shall
punish
thee
for
thou
hast
taught
them
to
be
captains
and
as
chief
over
thee
shall
not
sorrows
take
thee
as
a
woman
in
travail
and
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart
wherefore
come
these
things
upon
me
for
the
greatness
of
thine
iniquity
are
thy
skirts
discovered
and
thy
heels
made
bare
can
the
ethiopian
change
his
skin
or
the
leopard
his
spots
then
may
ye
also
do
good
that
are
accustomed
to
do
evil
therefore
will
i
scatter
them
as
the
stubble
that
passeth
away
by
the
wind
of
the
wilderness
this
is
thy
lot
the
portion
of
thy
measures
from
me
saith
the
lord
because
thou
hast
forgotten
me
and
trusted
in
falsehood
therefore
will
i
discover
thy
skirts
upon
thy
face
that
thy
shame
may
appear
i
have
seen
thine
adulteries
and
thy
neighings
the
lewdness
of
thy
whoredom
and
thine
abominations
on
the
hills
in
the
fields
woe
unto
thee
o
jerusalem
wilt
thou
not
be
made
clean
when
shall
it
once
be
the
word
of
the
lord
that
came
to
jeremiah
concerning
the
dearth
judah
mourneth
and
the
gates
thereof
languish
they
are
black
unto
the
ground
and
the
cry
of
jerusalem
is
gone
up
and
their
nobles
have
sent
their
little
ones
to
the
waters
they
came
to
the
pits
and
found
no
water
they
returned
with
their
vessels
empty
they
were
ashamed
and
confounded
and
covered
their
heads
because
the
ground
is
chapt
for
there
was
no
rain
in
the
earth
the
plowmen
were
ashamed
they
covered
their
heads
yea
the
hind
also
calved
in
the
field
and
forsook
it
because
there
was
no
grass
and
the
wild
asses
did
stand
in
the
high
places
they
snuffed
up
the
wind
like
dragons
their
eyes
did
fail
because
there
was
no
grass
o
lord
though
our
iniquities
testify
against
us
do
thou
it
for
thy
name's
sake
for
our
backslidings
are
many
we
have
sinned
against
thee
o
the
hope
of
israel
the
saviour
thereof
in
time
of
trouble
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
as
a
wayfaring
man
that
turneth
aside
to
tarry
for
a
night
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
man
astonied
as
a
mighty
man
that
cannot
save
yet
thou
o
lord
art
in
the
midst
of
us
and
we
are
called
by
thy
name
leave
us
not
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
this
people
thus
have
they
loved
to
wander
they
have
not
refrained
their
feet
therefore
the
lord
doth
not
accept
them
he
will
now
remember
their
iniquity
and
visit
their
sins
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
pray
not
for
this
people
for
their
good
when
they
fast
i
will
not
hear
their
cry
and
when
they
offer
burnt
offering
and
an
oblation
i
will
not
accept
them
but
i
will
consume
them
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
and
by
the
pestilence
then
said
i
ah
lord
god
behold
the
prophets
say
unto
them
ye
shall
not
see
the
sword
neither
shall
ye
have
famine
but
i
will
give
you
assured
peace
in
this
place
then
the
lord
said
unto
me
the
prophets
prophesy
lies
in
my
name
i
sent
them
not
neither
have
i
commanded
them
neither
spake
unto
them
they
prophesy
unto
you
a
false
vision
and
divination
and
a
thing
of
nought
and
the
deceit
of
their
heart
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
prophets
that
prophesy
in
my
name
and
i
sent
them
not
yet
they
say
sword
and
famine
shall
not
be
in
this
land
by
sword
and
famine
shall
those
prophets
be
consumed
and
the
people
to
whom
they
prophesy
shall
be
cast
out
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
because
of
the
famine
and
the
sword
and
they
shall
have
none
to
bury
them
them
their
wives
nor
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
for
i
will
pour
their
wickedness
upon
them
therefore
thou
shalt
say
this
word
unto
them
let
mine
eyes
run
down
with
tears
night
and
day
and
let
them
not
cease
for
the
virgin
daughter
of
my
people
is
broken
with
a
great
breach
with
a
very
grievous
blow
if
i
go
forth
into
the
field
then
behold
the
slain
with
the
sword
and
if
i
enter
into
the
city
then
behold
them
that
are
sick
with
famine
yea
both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
go
about
into
a
land
that
they
know
not
hast
thou
utterly
rejected
judah
hath
thy
soul
lothed
zion
why
hast
thou
smitten
us
and
there
is
no
healing
for
us
we
looked
for
peace
and
there
is
no
good
and
for
the
time
of
healing
and
behold
trouble
we
acknowledge
o
lord
our
wickedness
and
the
iniquity
of
our
fathers
for
we
have
sinned
against
thee
do
not
abhor
us
for
thy
name's
sake
do
not
disgrace
the
throne
of
thy
glory
remember
break
not
thy
covenant
with
us
are
there
any
among
the
vanities
of
the
gentiles
that
can
cause
rain
or
can
the
heavens
give
showers
art
not
thou
he
o
lord
our
god
therefore
we
will
wait
upon
thee
for
thou
hast
made
all
these
things
then
said
the
lord
unto
me
though
moses
and
samuel
stood
before
me
yet
my
mind
could
not
be
toward
this
people
cast
them
out
of
my
sight
and
let
them
go
forth
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
they
say
unto
thee
whither
shall
we
go
forth
then
thou
shalt
tell
them
thus
saith
the
lord
such
as
are
for
death
to
death
and
such
as
are
for
the
sword
to
the
sword
and
such
as
are
for
the
famine
to
the
famine
and
such
as
are
for
the
captivity
to
the
captivity
and
i
will
appoint
over
them
four
kinds
saith
the
lord
the
sword
to
slay
and
the
dogs
to
tear
and
the
fowls
of
the
heaven
and
the
beasts
of
the
earth
to
devour
and
destroy
and
i
will
cause
them
to
be
removed
into
all
kingdoms
of
the
earth
because
of
manasseh
the
son
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
for
that
which
he
did
in
jerusalem
for
who
shall
have
pity
upon
thee
o
jerusalem
or
who
shall
bemoan
thee
or
who
shall
go
aside
to
ask
how
thou
doest
thou
hast
forsaken
me
saith
the
lord
thou
art
gone
backward
therefore
will
i
stretch
out
my
hand
against
thee
and
destroy
thee
i
am
weary
with
repenting
and
i
will
fan
them
with
a
fan
in
the
gates
of
the
land
i
will
bereave
them
of
children
i
will
destroy
my
people
since
they
return
not
from
their
ways
their
widows
are
increased
to
me
above
the
sand
of
the
seas
i
have
brought
upon
them
against
the
mother
of
the
young
men
a
spoiler
at
noonday
i
have
caused
him
to
fall
upon
it
suddenly
and
terrors
upon
the
city
she
that
hath
borne
seven
languisheth
she
hath
given
up
the
ghost
her
sun
is
gone
down
while
it
was
yet
day
she
hath
been
ashamed
and
confounded
and
the
residue
of
them
will
i
deliver
to
the
sword
before
their
enemies
saith
the
lord
woe
is
me
my
mother
that
thou
hast
borne
me
a
man
of
strife
and
a
man
of
contention
to
the
whole
earth
i
have
neither
lent
on
usury
nor
men
have
lent
to
me
on
usury
yet
every
one
of
them
doth
curse
me
the
lord
said
verily
it
shall
be
well
with
thy
remnant
verily
i
will
cause
the
enemy
to
entreat
thee
well
in
the
time
of
evil
and
in
the
time
of
affliction
shall
iron
break
the
northern
iron
and
the
steel
thy
substance
and
thy
treasures
will
i
give
to
the
spoil
without
price
and
that
for
all
thy
sins
even
in
all
thy
borders
and
i
will
make
thee
to
pass
with
thine
enemies
into
a
land
which
thou
knowest
not
for
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger
which
shall
burn
upon
you
o
lord
thou
knowest
remember
me
and
visit
me
and
revenge
me
of
my
persecutors
take
me
not
away
in
thy
longsuffering
know
that
for
thy
sake
i
have
suffered
rebuke
thy
words
were
found
and
i
did
eat
them
and
thy
word
was
unto
me
the
joy
and
rejoicing
of
mine
heart
for
i
am
called
by
thy
name
o
lord
god
of
hosts
i
sat
not
in
the
assembly
of
the
mockers
nor
rejoiced
i
sat
alone
because
of
thy
hand
for
thou
hast
filled
me
with
indignation
why
is
my
pain
perpetual
and
my
wound
incurable
which
refuseth
to
be
healed
wilt
thou
be
altogether
unto
me
as
a
liar
and
as
waters
that
fail
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
if
thou
return
then
will
i
bring
thee
again
and
thou
shalt
stand
before
me
and
if
thou
take
forth
the
precious
from
the
vile
thou
shalt
be
as
my
mouth
let
them
return
unto
thee
but
return
not
thou
unto
them
and
i
will
make
thee
unto
this
people
a
fenced
brasen
wall
and
they
shall
fight
against
thee
but
they
shall
not
prevail
against
thee
for
i
am
with
thee
to
save
thee
and
to
deliver
thee
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
deliver
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
and
i
will
redeem
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
the
terrible
the
word
of
the
lord
came
also
unto
me
saying
thou
shalt
not
take
thee
a
wife
neither
shalt
thou
have
sons
or
daughters
in
this
place
for
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
sons
and
concerning
the
daughters
that
are
born
in
this
place
and
concerning
their
mothers
that
bare
them
and
concerning
their
fathers
that
begat
them
in
this
land
they
shall
die
of
grievous
deaths
they
shall
not
be
lamented
neither
shall
they
be
buried
but
they
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
shall
be
consumed
by
the
sword
and
by
famine
and
their
carcases
shall
be
meat
for
the
fowls
of
heaven
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
for
thus
saith
the
lord
enter
not
into
the
house
of
mourning
neither
go
to
lament
nor
bemoan
them
for
i
have
taken
away
my
peace
from
this
people
saith
the
lord
even
lovingkindness
and
mercies
both
the
great
and
the
small
shall
die
in
this
land
they
shall
not
be
buried
neither
shall
men
lament
for
them
nor
cut
themselves
nor
make
themselves
bald
for
them
neither
shall
men
tear
themselves
for
them
in
mourning
to
comfort
them
for
the
dead
neither
shall
men
give
them
the
cup
of
consolation
to
drink
for
their
father
or
for
their
mother
thou
shalt
not
also
go
into
the
house
of
feasting
to
sit
with
them
to
eat
and
to
drink
for
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
cause
to
cease
out
of
this
place
in
your
eyes
and
in
your
days
the
voice
of
mirth
and
the
voice
of
gladness
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
shalt
shew
this
people
all
these
words
and
they
shall
say
unto
thee
wherefore
hath
the
lord
pronounced
all
this
great
evil
against
us
or
what
is
our
iniquity
or
what
is
our
sin
that
we
have
committed
against
the
lord
our
god
then
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
because
your
fathers
have
forsaken
me
saith
the
lord
and
have
walked
after
other
gods
and
have
served
them
and
have
worshipped
them
and
have
forsaken
me
and
have
not
kept
my
law
and
ye
have
done
worse
than
your
fathers
for
behold
ye
walk
every
one
after
the
imagination
of
his
evil
heart
that
they
may
not
hearken
unto
me
therefore
will
i
cast
you
out
of
this
land
into
a
land
that
ye
know
not
neither
ye
nor
your
fathers
and
there
shall
ye
serve
other
gods
day
and
night
where
i
will
not
shew
you
favour
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
it
shall
no
more
be
said
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
from
the
land
of
the
north
and
from
all
the
lands
whither
he
had
driven
them
and
i
will
bring
them
again
into
their
land
that
i
gave
unto
their
fathers
