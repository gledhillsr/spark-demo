themselves
to

trumpet
then
the
princes
which

the
thousands
of

gather
themselves
unto
thee
when

blow
an
alarm

father
in
law
we

said
i
will
give
it
you
come
thou
with
us
and
we
will
do
thee
good
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
good
concerning

and
he
said
unto
him
i
will
not
go
but
i
will
depart
to
mine
own
land
and
to

kindred
and
he
said
leave
us
not
i
pray
thee
forasmuch
as
thou
knowest
how
we
are
to
encamp
in
the
wilderness
and
thou
mayest
be
to
us
instead
of
eyes
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
go
with
us
yea
it
shall
be
that
what
goodness
the
lord
shall
do
unto
us
the
same
will
we
do
unto
thee
and
they
departed
from
the
mount
of
the
lord
three
days
journey
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
went
before
them
in
the
three
days
journey
to
search
out
a
resting
place
for
them
and
the
cloud
of
the
lord
was
upon
them
by
day
when
they
went
out
of
the
camp
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
ark
set
forward
that
moses
said
rise
up
lord
and
let
thine
enemies
be
scattered
and
let
them
that
hate
thee
flee
before
thee
and
when
it
rested
he
said
return
o
lord
unto
the
many
thousands
of
israel
and
when
the
people
complained
it
displeased
the
lord
and
the
lord
heard
it
and
his
anger
was
kindled
and
the
fire
of
the
lord
burnt
among
them
and
consumed
them
that
were
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
camp
and
the
people
cried
unto
moses
and
when
moses
prayed
unto
the
lord
the
fire
was
quenched
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
taberah
because
the
fire
of
the
lord
burnt
among
them
and
the
mixt
multitude
that
was
among
them
fell
a
lusting
and
the
children
of
israel
also
wept
again
and
said
who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat
we
remember
the
fish
which
we
did
eat
in
egypt
freely
the
cucumbers
and
the
melons
and
the
leeks
and
the
onions
and
the
garlick
but
now
our
soul
is
dried
away
there
is
nothing
at
all
beside
this
manna
before
our
eyes
and
the
manna
was
as
coriander
seed
and
the
colour
thereof
as
the
colour
of
bdellium
and
the
people
went
about
and
gathered
it
and
ground
it
in
mills
or
beat
it
in
a
mortar
and
baked
it
in
pans
and
made
cakes
of
it
and
the
taste
of
it
was
as
the
taste
of
fresh
oil
and
when
the
dew
fell
upon
the
camp
in
the
night
the
manna
fell
upon
it
then
moses
heard
the
people
weep
throughout
their
families
every
man
in
the
door
of
his
tent
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
greatly
moses
also
was
displeased
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
wherefore
hast
thou
afflicted
thy
servant
and
wherefore
have
i
not
found
favour
in
thy
sight
that
thou
layest
the
burden
of
all
this
people
upon
me
have
i
conceived
all
this
people
have
i
begotten
them
that
thou
shouldest
say
unto
me
carry
them
in
thy
bosom
as
a
nursing
father
beareth
the
sucking
child
unto
the
land
which
thou
swarest
unto
their
fathers
whence
should
i
have
flesh
to
give
unto
all
this
people
for
they
weep
unto
me
saying
give
us
flesh
that
we
may
eat
i
am
not
able
to
bear
all
this
people
alone
because
it
is
too
heavy
for
me
and
if
thou
deal
thus
with
me
kill
me
i
pray
thee
out
of
hand
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
and
let
me
not
see
my
wretchedness
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
gather
unto
me
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
israel
whom
thou
knowest
to
be
the
elders
of
the
people
and
officers
over
them
and
bring
them
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
that
they
may
stand
there
with
thee
and
i
will
come
down
and
talk
with
thee
there
and
i
will
take
of
the
spirit
which
is
upon
thee
and
will
put
it
upon
them
and
they
shall
bear
the
burden
of
the
people
with
thee
that
thou
bear
it
not
thyself
alone
and
say
thou
unto
the
people
sanctify
yourselves
against
to
morrow
and
ye
shall
eat
flesh
for
ye
have
wept
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
saying
who
shall
give
us
flesh
to
eat
for
it
was
well
with
us
in
egypt
therefore
the
lord
will
give
you
flesh
and
ye
shall
eat
ye
shall
not
eat
one
day
nor
two
days
nor
five
days
neither
ten
days
nor
twenty
days
but
even
a
whole
month
until
it
come
out
at
your
nostrils
and
it
be
loathsome
unto
you
because
that
ye
have
despised
the
lord
which
is
among
you
and
have
wept
before
him
saying
why
came
we
forth
out
of
egypt
and
moses
said
the
people
among
whom
i
am
are
six
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
thou
hast
said
i
will
give
them
flesh
that
they
may
eat
a
whole
month
shall
the
flocks
and
the
herds
be
slain
for
them
to
suffice
them
or
shall
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
be
gathered
together
for
them
to
suffice
them
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
is
the
lord's
hand
waxed
short
thou
shalt
see
now
whether
my
word
shall
come
to
pass
unto
thee
or
not
and
moses
went
out
and
told
the
people
the
words
of
the
lord
and
gathered
the
seventy
men
of
the
elders
of
the
people
and
set
them
round
about
the
tabernacle
and
the
lord
came
down
in
a
cloud
and
spake
unto
him
and
took
of
the
spirit
that
was
upon
him
and
gave
it
unto
the
seventy
elders
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
spirit
rested
upon
them
they
prophesied
and
did
not
cease
but
there
remained
two
of
the
men
in
the
camp
the
name
of
the
one
was
eldad
and
the
name
of
the
other
medad
and
the
spirit
rested
upon
them
and
they
were
of
them
that
were
written
but
went
not
out
unto
the
tabernacle
and
they
prophesied
in
the
camp
and
there
ran
a
young
man
and
told
moses
and
said
eldad
and
medad
do
prophesy
in
the
camp
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
moses
one
of
his
young
men
answered
and
said
my
lord
moses
forbid
them
and
moses
said
unto
him
enviest
thou
for
my
sake
would
god
that
all
the
lord's
people
were
prophets
and
that
the
lord
would
put
his
spirit
upon
them
and
moses
gat
him
into
the
camp
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
there
went
forth
a
wind
from
the
lord
and
brought
quails
from
the
sea
and
let
them
fall
by
the
camp
as
it
were
a
day's
journey
on
this
side
and
as
it
were
a
day's
journey
on
the
other
side
round
about
the
camp
and
as
it
were
two
cubits
high
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
people
stood
up
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
and
they
gathered
the
quails
he
that
gathered
least
gathered
ten
homers
and
they
spread
them
all
abroad
for
themselves
round
about
the
camp
and
while
the
flesh
was
yet
between
their
teeth
ere
it
was
chewed
the
wrath
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
the
people
and
the
lord
smote
the
people
with
a
very
great
plague
and
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
kibrothhattaavah
because
there
they
buried
the
people
that
lusted
and
the
people
journeyed
from
kibrothhattaavah
unto
hazeroth
and
abode
at
hazeroth
and
miriam
and
aaron
spake
against
moses
because
of
the
ethiopian
woman
whom
he
had
married
for
he
had
married
an
ethiopian
woman
and
they
said
hath
the
lord
indeed
spoken
only
by
moses
hath
he
not
spoken
also
by
us
and
the
lord
heard
it
now
the
man
moses
was
very
meek
above
all
the
men
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
lord
spake
suddenly
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
and
unto
miriam
come
out
ye
three
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
three
came
out
and
the
lord
came
down
in
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
and
called
aaron
and
miriam
and
they
both
came
forth
and
he
said
hear
now
my
words
if
there
be
a
prophet
among
you
i
the
lord
will
make
myself
known
unto
him
in
a
vision
and
will
speak
unto
him
in
a
dream
my
servant
moses
is
not
so
who
is
faithful
in
all
mine
house
with
him
will
i
speak
mouth
to
mouth
even
apparently
and
not
in
dark
speeches
and
the
similitude
of
the
lord
shall
he
behold
wherefore
then
were
ye
not
afraid
to
speak
against
my
servant
moses
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
them
and
he
departed
and
the
cloud
departed
from
off
the
tabernacle
and
behold
miriam
became
leprous
white
as
snow
and
aaron
looked
upon
miriam
and
behold
she
was
leprous
and
aaron
said
unto
moses
alas
my
lord
i
beseech
thee
lay
not
the
sin
upon
us
wherein
we
have
done
foolishly
and
wherein
we
have
sinned
let
her
not
be
as
one
dead
of
whom
the
flesh
is
half
consumed
when
he
cometh
out
of
his
mother's
womb
and
moses
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
heal
her
now
o
god
i
beseech
thee
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
if
her
father
had
but
spit
in
her
face
should
she
not
be
ashamed
seven
days
let
her
be
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days
and
after
that
let
her
be
received
in
again
and
miriam
was
shut
out
from
the
camp
seven
days
and
the
people
journeyed
not
till
miriam
was
brought
in
again
and
afterward
the
people
removed
from
hazeroth
and
pitched
in
the
wilderness

unto

and
bring
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
now
the
time
was
the
time
of
the
firstripe
grapes
so
they
went
up
and
searched
the
land
from
the
wilderness
of
zin
unto
rehob
as
men
come
to
hamath
and
they
ascended
by
the
south
and
came
unto
hebron
where
ahiman
sheshai
and
talmai
the
children
of
anak
were
now
hebron
was
built
seven
years
before
zoan
in
egypt
and
they
came
unto
the
brook
of
eshcol
and
cut
down
from
thence
a
branch
with
one
cluster
of
grapes
and
they
bare
it
between
two
upon
a
staff
and
they
brought
of
the
pomegranates
and
of
the
figs
the
place
was
called
the
brook
eshcol
because
of
the
cluster
of
grapes
which
the
children
of
israel
cut
down
from
thence
and
they
returned
from
searching
of
the
land
after
forty
days
and
they
went
and
came
to
moses
and
to
aaron
and
to
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
unto
the
wilderness
of
paran
to
kadesh
and
brought
back
word
unto
them
and
unto
all
the
congregation
and
shewed
them
the
fruit
of
the
land
and
they
told
him
and
said
we
came
unto
the
land
whither
thou
sentest
us
and
surely
it
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
this
is
the
fruit
of
it
nevertheless
the
people
be
strong
that
dwell
in
the
land
and
the
cities
are
walled
and
very
great
and
moreover
we
saw
the
children
of
anak
there
the
amalekites
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
south
and
the
hittites
and
the
jebusites
and
the
amorites
dwell
in
the
mountains
and
the
canaanites
dwell
by
the
sea
and
by
the
coast
of
jordan
and
caleb
stilled
the
people
before
moses
and
said
let
us
go
up
at
once
and
possess
it
for
we
are
well
able
to
overcome
it
but
the
men
that
went
up
with
him
said
we
be
not
able
to
go
up
against
the
people
for
they
are
stronger
than
we
and
they
brought
up
an
evil
report
of
the
land
which
they
had
searched
unto
the
children
of
israel
saying
the
land
through
which
we
have
gone
to
search
it
is
a
land
that
eateth
up
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
all
the
people
that
we
saw
in
it
are
men
of
a
great
stature
and
there
we
saw
the
giants
the
sons
of
anak
which
come
of
the
giants
and
we
were
in
our
own
sight
as
grasshoppers
and
so
we
were
in
their
sight
and
all
the
congregation
lifted
up
their
voice
and
cried
and
the
people
wept
that
night
and
all
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
against
aaron
and
the
whole
congregation
said
unto
them
would
god
that
we
had
died
in
the
land
of
egypt
or
would
god
we
had
died
in
this
wilderness
and
wherefore
hath
the
lord
brought
us
unto
this
land
to
fall
by
the
sword
that
our
wives
and
our
children
should
be
a
prey
were
it
not
better
for
us
to
return
into
egypt
and
they
said
one
to
another
let
us
make
a
captain
and
let
us
return
into
egypt
then
moses
and
aaron
fell
on
their
faces
before
all
the
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
which
were
of
them
that
searched
the
land
rent
their
clothes
and
they
spake
unto
all
the
company
of
the
children
of
israel
saying
the
land
which
we
passed
through
to
search
it
is
an
exceeding
good
land
if
the
lord
delight
in
us
then
he
will
bring
us
into
this
land
and
give
it
us
a
land
which
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
only
rebel
not
ye
against
the
lord
neither
fear
ye
the
people
of
the
land
for
they
are
bread
for
us
their
defence
is
departed
from
them
and
the
lord
is
with
us
fear
them
not
but
all
the
congregation
bade
stone
them
with
stones
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
all
the
children
of
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
how
long
will
this
people
provoke
me
and
how
long
will
it
be
ere
they
believe
me
for
all
the
signs
which
i
have
shewed
among
them
i
will
smite
them
with
the
pestilence
and
disinherit
them
and
will
make
of
thee
a
greater
nation
and
mightier
than
they
and
moses
said
unto
the
lord
then
the
egyptians
shall
hear
it
for
thou
broughtest
up
this
people
in
thy
might
from
among
them
and
they
will
tell
it
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
for
they
have
heard
that
thou
lord
art
among
this
people
that
thou
lord
art
seen
face
to
face
and
that
thy
cloud
standeth
over
them
and
that
thou
goest
before
them
by
day
time
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud
and
in
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
now
if
thou
shalt
kill
all
this
people
as
one
man
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
of
thee
will
speak
saying
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
them
therefore
he
hath
slain
them
in
the
wilderness
and
now
i
beseech
thee
let
the
power
of
my
lord
be
great
according
as
thou
hast
spoken
saying
the
lord
is
longsuffering
and
of
great
mercy
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
by
no
means
clearing
the
guilty
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
pardon
i
beseech
thee
the
iniquity
of
this
people
according
unto
the
greatness
of
thy
mercy
and
as
thou
hast
forgiven
this
people
from
egypt
even
until
now
and
the
lord
said
i
have
pardoned
according
to
thy
word
but
as
truly
as
i
live
all
the
earth
shall
be
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
lord
because
all
those
men
which
have
seen
my
glory
and
my
miracles
which
i
did
in
egypt
and
in
the
wilderness
and
have
tempted
me
now
these
ten
times
and
have
not
hearkened
to
my
voice
surely
they
shall
not
see
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
neither
shall
any
of
them
that
provoked
me
see
it
but
my
servant
caleb
because
he
had
another
spirit
with
him
and
hath
followed
me
fully
him
will
i
bring
into
the
land
whereinto
he
went
and
his
seed
shall
possess
it
now
the
amalekites
and
the
canaanites
dwelt
in
the
valley
tomorrow
turn
you
and
get
you
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
how
long
shall
i
bear
with
this
evil
congregation
which
murmur
against
me
i
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
israel
which
they
murmur
against
me
say
unto
them
as
truly
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
as
ye
have
spoken
in
mine
ears
so
will
i
do
to
you
your
carcases
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness
and
all
that
were
numbered
of
you
according
to
your
whole
number
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
which
have
murmured
against
me
doubtless
ye
shall
not
come
into
the
land
concerning
which
i
sware
to
make
you
dwell
therein
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
but
your
little
ones
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey
them
will
i
bring
in
and
they
shall
know
the
land
which
ye
have
despised
but
as
for
you
your
carcases
they
shall
fall
in
this
wilderness
and
your
children
shall
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
and
bear
your
whoredoms
until
your
carcases
be
wasted
in
the
wilderness
after
the
number
of
the
days
in
which
ye
searched
the
land
even
forty
days
each
day
for
a
year
shall
ye
bear
your
iniquities
even
forty
years
and
ye
shall
know
my
breach
of
promise
i
the
lord
have
said
i
will
surely
do
it
unto
all
this
evil
congregation
that
are
gathered
together
against
me
in
this
wilderness
they
shall
be
consumed
and
there
they
shall
die
and
the
men
which
moses
sent
to
search
the
land
who
returned
and
made
all
the
congregation
to
murmur
against
him
by
bringing
up
a
slander
upon
the
land
even
those
men
that
did
bring
up
the
evil
report
upon
the
land
died
by
the
plague
before
the
lord
but
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
which
were
of
the
men
that
went
to
search
the
land
lived
still
and
moses
told
these
sayings
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
the
people
mourned
greatly
and
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
gat
them
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
saying
lo
we
be
here
and
will
go
up
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
hath
promised
for
we
have
sinned
and
moses
said
wherefore
now
do
ye
transgress
the
commandment
of
the
lord
but
it
shall
not
prosper
go
not
up
for
the
lord
is
not
among
you
that
ye
be
not
smitten
before
your
enemies
for
the
amalekites
and
the
canaanites
are
there
before
you
and
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword
because
ye
are
turned
away
from
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
will
not
be
with
you
but
they
presumed
to
go
up
unto
the
hill
top
nevertheless
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
moses
departed
not
out
of
the
camp
then
the
amalekites
came
down
and
the
canaanites
which
dwelt
in
that
hill
and
smote
them
and
discomfited
them
even
unto
hormah
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
be
come
into
the
land
of
your
habitations
which
i
give
unto
you
and
will
make
an
offering
by
fire
unto
the
lord
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow
or
in
a
freewill
offering
or
in
your
solemn
feasts
to
make
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
of
the
herd
or
of
the
flock
then
shall
he
that
offereth
his
offering
unto
the
lord
bring
a
meat
offering
of
a
tenth
deal
of

mingled
with

two
tenth

offering
thou
shalt
offer
the
third
part
of
an

of

for
a

unto
the

and
when
thou
preparest
a
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering
or
for
a
sacrifice
in
performing
a
vow
or
peace
offerings
unto
the

then

he
bring

offering
half
an

for
an

made
by

of

thus
shall
it
be
done
for
one
bullock
or
for
one
ram
or
for
a
lamb
or
a
kid
according
to
the
number
that
ye
shall
prepare
so
shall
ye
do
to
every

according
to
their
number
all
that
are
born
of
the
country
shall
do
these
things
after
this
manner
in
offering
an
offering
made
by

of
a
sweet

unto
the

and
if
a
stranger
sojourn
with
you
or
whosoever
be
among
you
in
your
generations
and
will
offer
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
as
ye
do
so
he
shall
do
one
ordinance
shall
be
both
for
you
of
the
congregation
and
also
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you
an
ordinance
for
ever
in
your
generations
as
ye
are
so
shall
the
stranger
be
before
the
lord
one
law
and
one
manner
shall
be
for
you
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
with
you
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
come
into
the
land
whither
i
bring
you
then

offering
unto

ye

offering
as
ye

so
shall
ye
heave
it
of
the
first
of
your
dough
ye
shall
give
unto
the
lord
an
heave
offering
in
your
generations
and
if
ye
have
erred
and
not
observed
all
these
commandments
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
unto
moses
even
all
that
the
lord
hath
commanded
you
by
the
hand
of
moses
from
the
day
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
henceforward
among
your
generations
then
it
shall
be
if
ought
be
committed
by
ignorance
without
the
knowledge
of
the
congregation
that
all
the
congregation
shall
offer
one
young
bullock
for
a
burnt
offering
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
lord
with
his
meat
offering
and
his
drink
offering
according

the
manner
and
one
kid
of
the
goats
for
a
sin
offering
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
them
for
it
is
ignorance

bring
their
offering
a

and
their
sin
offering
before
the
lord
for
their

and
it
shall
be
forgiven
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
and
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them
seeing
all
the
people
were
in
ignorance
and
if
any
soul
sin
through
ignorance
then
he
shall
bring
a
she
goat
of
the
first
year
for
a
sin
offering
and
the
priest
shall
make
an
atonement
for
the
soul
that
sinneth
ignorantly
when
he
sinneth
by
ignorance
before
the
lord
to
make
an
atonement
for
him
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
ye
shall
have
one
law
for
him
that
sinneth
through
ignorance
both
for
him
that
is
born
among
the
children
of
israel
and
for
the
stranger
that
sojourneth
among
them
but
the
soul
that
doeth
ought
presumptuously
whether
he
be
born
in
the
land
or
a
stranger
the
same
reproacheth
the
lord
and
that
soul
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
because
he
hath
despised
the
word
of
the
lord
and
hath
broken
his
commandment
that
soul
shall
utterly
be
cut
off
his
iniquity
shall
be
upon
him
and
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness
they
found
a
man
that
gathered
sticks
upon
the
sabbath
day
and
they
that
found
him
gathering
sticks
brought
him
unto
moses
and
aaron
and
unto
all
the
congregation
and
they
put
him
in
ward
because
it
was
not
declared
what
should
be
done
to
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
all
the
congregation
shall
stone
him
with
stones
without
the
camp
and
all
the
congregation
brought
him
without
the
camp
and
stoned
him
with
stones
and
he
died
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
bid
them
that
they
make
them
fringes
in
the
borders
of
their
garments
throughout
their
generations
and
that
they
put
upon
the
fringe
of
the
borders
a
ribband
of
blue
and
it
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
fringe
that
ye
may
look
upon
it
and
remember
all
the
commandments
of
the

much
upon

every
one
of

and
the

is
among

wherefore
then
lift
ye
up
yourselves
above
the
congregation
of
the
lord
and
when
moses
heard
it
he
fell
upon
his
face
and
he
spake
unto
korah
and
unto
all
his
company
saying
even
to

the
lord
will
shew
who
are
his
and
who
is

and
will
cause

that
the
man
whom
the
lord
doth
choose
he
shall
be
holy
ye
take
too
much
upon
you
ye
sons
of
levi
and
moses
said
unto
korah
hear
i
pray
you
ye
sons
of
levi
seemeth
it
but
a
small
thing
unto
you
that
the
god
of
israel
hath
separated
you
from
the
congregation
of
israel
to
bring
you
near
to
himself
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
to
stand
before
the
congregation
to
minister
unto
them
and
he
hath
brought
thee
near
to
him
and
all
thy
brethren
the
sons
of
levi
with
thee
and
seek
ye
the
priesthood
also
for
which
cause
both
thou
and
all
thy
company
are
gathered
together
against
the
lord
and
what
is
aaron
that
ye
murmur
against
him
and
moses
sent
to
call
dathan
and
abiram
the
sons
of
eliab
which
said
we
will
not
come
up
is
it
a
small
thing
that
thou
hast
brought
us
up
out
of
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
to
kill
us
in
the
wilderness
except
thou
make
thyself
altogether
a
prince
over
us
moreover
thou
hast
not
brought
us
into
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
or
given
us
inheritance
of
fields
and
vineyards
wilt
thou
put
out
the
eyes
of
these
men
we
will
not
come
up
and
moses
was
very
wroth
and
said
unto
the
lord
respect
not
thou
their
offering
i
have
not
taken
one
ass
from
them
neither
have
i
hurt
one
of
them
and
moses
said
unto
korah
be
thou
and
all
thy
company
before
the
lord
thou
and
they
and
aaron
to
morrow
and
take
every
man

thou
also

of
you
his

his
censer
and
put

in
them
and
laid

thereon
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
with
moses
and
aaron
and
korah
gathered
all
the
congregation
against
them
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
all
the
congregation
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
separate
yourselves
from
among
this
congregation
that
i
may
consume
them
in
a
moment
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
said
o
god
the
god
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh
shall
one
man
sin
and
wilt
thou
be
wroth
with
all
the
congregation
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
congregation
saying
get
you
up
from
about
the
tabernacle
of
korah
dathan
and
abiram
and
moses
rose
up
and
went
unto
dathan
and
abiram
and
the
elders
of
israel
followed
him
and
he
spake
unto
the
congregation
saying
depart
i
pray
you
from
the
tents
of
these
wicked
men
and
touch
nothing
of
their's
lest
ye
be
consumed
in
all
their
sins
so
they
gat
up
from
the
tabernacle
of
korah
dathan
and
abiram
on
every
side
and
dathan
and
abiram
came
out
and
stood
in
the
door
of
their
tents
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
little
children
and
moses
said
hereby
ye
shall
know
that
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
do
all
these
works
for
i
have
not
done
them
of
mine
own
mind
if
these
men
die
the
common
death
of
all
men
or
if
they
be
visited
after
the
visitation
of
all
men
then
the
lord
hath
not
sent
me
but
if
the
lord
make
a
new
thing
and
the
earth
open
her
mouth
and
swallow
them
up
with
all
that
appertain
unto
them
and
they
go
down
quick
into
the
pit
then
ye
shall
understand
that
these
men
have
provoked
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words
that
the
ground
clave
asunder
that
was
under
them
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
them
up
and
their
houses
and
all
the
men
that
appertained
unto
korah
and
all
their
goods
they
and
all
that
appertained
to
them
went
down
alive
into
the
pit
and
the
earth
closed
upon
them
and
they
perished
from
among
the
congregation
and
all
israel
that
were
round
about
them
fled
at
the
cry
of
them
for
they
said
lest
the
earth
swallow
us
up
also
and
there
came
out
a
fire
from
the
lord
and
consumed
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
that
offered
incense
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
the
priest
that
he
take
up
the
censers
out
of
the
burning
and
scatter
thou
the
fire
yonder
for
they
are
hallowed
the
censers
of
these
sinners
against
their
own
souls
let
them
make
them
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar
for
they
offered
them
before
the
lord
therefore
they
are
hallowed
and
they
shall
be
a
sign
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
eleazar
the
priest
took
the
brasen
censers
wherewith
they
that
were
burnt
had
offered
and
they
were
made
broad
plates
for
a
covering
of
the
altar
to
be
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
no
stranger
which
is
not
of
the
seed
of
aaron
come
near
to
offer
incense
before
the
lord
that
he
be
not
as
korah
and
as
his
company
as
the
lord
said
to
him
by
the
hand
of
moses
but
on
the
morrow
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
murmured
against
moses
and
against
aaron
saying
ye
have
killed
the
people
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
congregation
was
gathered
against
moses
and
against
aaron
that
they
looked
toward
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
behold
the
cloud
covered
it
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
and
moses
and
aaron
came
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
get
you
up
from
among
this
congregation
that
i
may
consume
them
as
in
a
moment
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
moses
said
unto
aaron
take
a
censer
and
put
fire
therein
from
off
the
altar
and
put
on
incense
and
go
quickly
unto
the
congregation
and
make
an
atonement
for
them
for
there
is
wrath
gone
out
from
the
lord
the
plague
is
begun
and
aaron
took
as
moses
commanded
and
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
behold
the
plague
was
begun
among
the
people
and
he
put
on
incense
and
made
an
atonement
for
the
people
and
he
stood
between
the
dead
and
the
living
and
the
plague
was
stayed
now
they
that
died
in
the
plague
were
fourteen
thousand
and
seven
hundred
beside
them
that
died
about
the
matter
of
korah
and
aaron
returned
unto
moses
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
plague
was
stayed
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
take
of
every
one
of
them
a
rod
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
of
all
their
princes
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
twelve
rods
write
thou
every
man's
name
upon
his
rod
and
thou
shalt
write
aaron's
name
upon
the
rod
of
levi
for
one
rod
shall
be
for
the
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
thou
shalt
lay
them
up
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
before
the
testimony
where
i
will
meet
with
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
man's
rod
whom
i
shall
choose
shall
blossom
and
i
will
make
to
cease
from
me
the
murmurings
of
the
children
of
israel
whereby
they
murmur
against
you
and
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
every
one
of
their
princes
gave
him
a
rod
apiece
for
each
prince
one
according
to
their
fathers
houses
even
twelve
rods
and
the
rod
of
aaron
was
among
their
rods
and
moses
laid
up
the
rods
before
the
lord
in
the
tabernacle
of
witness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
moses
went
into
the
tabernacle
of
witness
and
behold
the
rod
of
aaron
for
the
house
of
levi
was
budded
and
brought
forth
buds
and
bloomed
blossoms
and
yielded
almonds
and
moses
brought
out
all
the
rods
from
before
the
lord
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
they
looked
and
took
every
man
his
rod
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
bring
aaron's
rod
again
before
the
testimony
to
be
kept
for
a
token
against
the
rebels
and
thou
shalt
quite
take
away
their
murmurings
from
me
that
they
die
not
and
moses
did
so
as
the
lord
commanded
him
so
did
he
and
the
children
of
israel
spake
unto
moses
saying
behold
we
die
we
perish
we
all
perish
whosoever
cometh
any
thing
near
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
shall
die
shall
we
be
consumed
with
dying
and
the
lord
said
unto
aaron
thou
and
thy
sons
and
thy
father's
house
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
sanctuary
and
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
bear
the
iniquity
of
your
priesthood
and
thy
brethren
also
of
the
tribe
of
levi
the
tribe
of
thy
father
bring
thou
with
thee
that
they
may
be
joined
unto
thee
and
minister
unto
thee
but
thou
and
thy
sons
with
thee
shall
minister
before
the
tabernacle
of
witness
and
they
shall
keep
thy
charge
and
the
charge
of
all
the
tabernacle
only
they
shall
not
come
nigh
the
vessels
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
altar
that
neither
they
nor
ye
also
die
and
they
shall
be
joined
unto
thee
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
for
all
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
and
a
stranger
shall
not
come
nigh
unto
you
and
ye
shall
keep
the
charge
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
charge
of
the
altar
that
there
be
no
wrath
any
more
upon
the
children
of
israel
and
i
behold
i
have
taken
your
brethren
the
levites
from
among
the
children
of
israel
to
you
they
are
given
as
a
gift
for
the
lord
to
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
therefore
thou
and
thy
sons

thou

land
neither
shalt
thou
have
any
part
among
them
i
am
thy
part
and
thine
inheritance
among
the
children
of
israel
and
behold
i
have
given
the
children
of
levi
all
the
tenth
in
israel
for
an
inheritance
for
their
service
which
they
serve
even
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
neither
must
the
children
of
israel
henceforth
come
nigh
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
lest
they
bear
sin
and
die
but
the
levites
shall
do
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
it
shall
be
a
statute
for
ever
throughout
your
generations
that
among
the
children
of
israel
they
have
no
inheritance
but
the
tithes
of
the
children
of
israel
which
they
offer
as
an
heave
offering
unto
the
lord
i
have
given
to
the
levites
to
inherit
therefore
i
have
said
unto
them
among
the
children
of
israel
they
shall
have
no
inheritance
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
thus
speak
unto
the
levites
and
say
unto
them
when
ye
take
of
the
children
of
israel
the
tithes
which
i
have
given
you
from
them
for
your
inheritance
then
ye
shall
offer
up
an
heave
offering
of
it
for
the
lord
even
a
tenth
part
of
the
tithe
and
this
your
heave
offering
shall
be
reckoned
unto
you
as
though
it
were
the
corn
of
the
threshingfloor
and
as
the
fulness
of
the
winepress
thus
ye
also
shall
offer
an
heave
offering
unto
the
lord
of
all
your
tithes
which
ye
receive
of
the
children
of
israel
and
ye
shall
give
thereof
the
lord's
heave
offering
to
aaron
the
priest
out
of
all
your
gifts
ye
shall
offer
every
heave
offering
of
the
lord
of
all
the
best
thereof
even
the
hallowed
part
thereof
out
of
it
therefore
thou
shalt
say
unto
them
when
ye
have
heaved
the
best
thereof
from
it
then
it
shall
be
counted
unto
the
levites
as
the

and
ye
shall
eat
it
in
every
place
ye
and
your
households
for
it
is
your
reward
for
your
service
in
the
tabernacle
of
the

and
ye
shall
bear
no
sin
by
reason
of
it
when
ye
have
heaved
from
it
the
best
of
it
neither
shall
ye
pollute
the
holy
things
of
the
children
of
israel
lest
ye
die
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
unto
aaron
saying
this
is
the
ordinance
of
the
law
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
saying
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
bring
thee
a
red

and
ye

slay
her

take
of
her
blood
with
his

sprinkle
of

seven
times
and
one
shall
burn
the
heifer
in
his
sight
her
skin
and
her
flesh
and
her
blood
with
her
dung
shall
he
burn
and
the

take
cedar

gather
up
the

them
up
without
the

and
it
shall
be
kept
for
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
for
a

he
that

seven
days
he

purify
not
himself

and
purifieth
not
himself
defileth
the
tabernacle
of

and
that
soul
shall

because
the

separation
was
not
sprinkled
upon

he
shall

his

this
is

all
that

the
man
that

unclean
and

that

he
is
unclean

and
whatsoever
the
unclean
person
toucheth
shall
be
unclean
and
the
soul
that
toucheth
it
shall
be
unclean
until
even
then
came
the
children
of
israel
even
the
whole
congregation
into
the
desert
of
zin
in
the
first
month
and
the
people
abode
in
kadesh
and
miriam
died
there
and
was
buried
there
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
congregation
and
they
gathered
themselves
together
against
moses
and
against
aaron
and
the
people
chode
with
moses
and
spake
saying
would
god
that
we
had
died
when
our
brethren
died
before
the
lord
and
why
have
ye
brought
up
the
congregation
of
the
lord
into
this
wilderness
that
we
and
our
cattle
should
die
there
and
wherefore
have
ye
made
us
to
come
up
out
of
egypt
to
bring
us
in
unto
this
evil
place
it
is
no
place
of
seed
or
of
figs
or
of
vines
or
of
pomegranates
neither
is
there
any
water
to
drink
and
moses
and
aaron
went
from
the
presence
of
the
assembly
unto
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
they
fell
upon
their
faces
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
them
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
take
the
rod
and
gather
thou
the
assembly
together
thou
and
aaron
thy
brother
and
speak
ye
unto
the
rock
before
their
eyes
and
it
shall
give
forth
his
water
and
thou
shalt
bring
forth
to
them
water
out
of
the
rock
so
thou
shalt
give
the
congregation
and
their
beasts
drink
and
moses
took
the
rod
from
before
the
lord
as
he
commanded
him
and
moses
and
aaron
gathered
the
congregation
together
before
the
rock
and
he
said
unto
them
hear
now
ye
rebels
must
we
fetch
you
water
out
of
this
rock
and
moses
lifted
up
his
hand
and
with
his
rod
he
smote
the
rock
twice
and
the
water
came
out
abundantly
and
the
congregation
drank
and
their
beasts
also
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
because
ye
believed
me
not
to
sanctify
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
of
israel
therefore
ye
shall
not
bring
this
congregation
into
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
this
is
the
water
of
meribah
because
the
children
of
israel
strove
with
the
lord
and
he
was
sanctified
in
them
and
moses
sent
messengers
from
kadesh
unto
the
king
of
edom
thus
saith
thy
brother
israel
thou
knowest
all
the
travail
that
hath
befallen
us
how
our
fathers
went
down
into
egypt
and
we
have
dwelt
in
egypt
a
long
time
and
the
egyptians
vexed
us
and
our
fathers
and
when
we
cried
unto
the
lord
he
heard
our
voice
and
sent
an
angel
and
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
and
behold
we
are
in
kadesh
a
city
in
the
uttermost
of
thy
border
let
us
pass
i
pray
thee
through
thy
country
we
will
not
pass
through
the
fields
or
through
the
vineyards
neither
will
we
drink
of
the
water
of
the
wells
we
will
go
by
the
king's
high
way
we
will
not
turn
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
until
we
have
passed
thy
borders
and
edom
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
pass
by
me
lest
i
come
out
against
thee
with
the
sword
and
the
children
of
israel
said
unto
him
we
will
go
by
the
high
way
and
if
i
and
my
cattle
drink
of
thy
water
then
i
will
pay
for
it
i
will
only
without
doing
anything
else
go
through
on
my
feet
and
he
said
thou
shalt
not
go
through
and
edom
came
out
against
him
with
much
people
and
with
a
strong
hand
thus
edom
refused
to
give
israel
passage
through
his
border
wherefore
israel
turned
away
from
him
and
the
children
of
israel
even
the
whole
congregation
journeyed
from
kadesh
and
came
unto
mount
hor
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
in
mount
hor
by
the
coast
of
the
land
of
edom
saying
aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people
for
he
shall
not
enter
into
the
land
which
i
have
given
unto
the
children
of
israel
because
ye
rebelled
against
my
word
at
the
water
of
meribah
take
aaron
and
eleazar
his
son
and
bring
them
up
unto
mount
hor
and
strip
aaron
of
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
eleazar
his
son
and
aaron
shall
be
gathered
unto
his
people
and
shall
die
there
and
moses
did
as
the
lord
commanded
and
they
went
up
into
mount
hor
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation
and
moses
stripped
aaron
of
his
garments
and
put
them
upon
eleazar
his
son
and
aaron
died
there
in
the
top
of
the
mount
and
moses
and
eleazar
came
down
from
the
mount
and
when
all
the
congregation
saw
that
aaron
was
dead
they
mourned
for
aaron
thirty
days
even
all
the
house
of
israel
and
when
king
arad
the
canaanite
which
dwelt
in
the
south
heard
tell
that
israel
came
by
the
way
of
the
spies
then
he
fought
against
israel
and
took
some
of
them
prisoners
and
israel
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
said
if
thou
wilt
indeed
deliver
this
people
into
my
hand
then
i
will
utterly
destroy
their
cities
and
the
lord
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
israel
and
delivered
up
the
canaanites
and
they
utterly
destroyed
them
and
their
cities
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
hormah
and
they
journeyed
from
mount
hor
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
to
compass
the
land
of
edom
and
the
soul
of
the
people
was
much
discouraged
because
of
the
way
and
the
people
spake
against
god
and
against
moses
wherefore
have
ye
brought
us
up
out
of
egypt
to
die
in
the
wilderness
for
there
is
no
bread
neither
is
there
any
water
and
our
soul
loatheth
this
light
bread
and
the
lord
sent
fiery
serpents
among
the
people
and
they
bit
the
people
and
much
people
of
israel
died
therefore
the
people
came
to
moses
and
said
we
have
sinned
for
we
have
spoken
against
the
lord
and
against
thee
pray
unto
the
lord
that
he
take
away
the
serpents
from
us
and
moses
prayed
for
the
people
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
make
thee
a
fiery
serpent
and
set
it
upon
a
pole
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
one
that
is
bitten
when
he
looketh
upon
it
shall
live
and
moses
made
a
serpent
of
brass
and
put
it
upon
a
pole
and
it
came
to
pass
that
if
a
serpent
had
bitten
any
man
when
he
beheld
the
serpent
of
brass
he
lived
and
the
children
of
israel
set
forward
and
pitched
in
oboth
and
they
journeyed
from
oboth
and
pitched
at
ijeabarim
in
the
wilderness
which
is
before
moab
toward
the
sunrising
from
thence
they
removed
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
zared
from
thence
they
removed
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
arnon
which
is
in
the
wilderness
that
cometh
out
of
the
coasts
of
the
amorites
for
arnon
is
the
border
of
moab
between
moab
and
the
amorites
wherefore
it
is
said
in
the
book
of
the
wars
of
the
lord
what
he
did
in
the
red
sea
and
in
the
brooks
of
arnon
and
at
the
stream
of
the
brooks
that
goeth
down
to
the
dwelling
of
ar
and
lieth
upon
the
border
of
moab
and
from
thence
they
went
to
beer
that
is
the
well
whereof
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
gather
the
people
together
and
i
will
give
them
water
then
israel
sang
this
song
spring
up
o
well
sing
ye
unto
it
the
princes
digged
the
well
the
nobles
of
the
people
digged
it
by
the
direction
of
the
lawgiver
with
their
staves
and
from
the
wilderness
they
went
to
mattanah
and
from
mattanah
to
nahaliel
and
from
nahaliel
to
bamoth
and
from
bamoth
in
the
valley
that
is
in
the
country
of
moab
to
the
top
of
pisgah
which
looketh
toward
jeshimon
and
israel
sent
messengers
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
saying
let
me
pass
through
thy
land
we
will
not
turn
into
the
fields
or
into
the
vineyards
we
will
not
drink
of
the
waters
of
the
well
but
we
will
go
along
by
the
king's
high
way
until
we
be
past
thy
borders
and
sihon
would
not
suffer
israel
to
pass
through
his
border
but
sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
went
out
against
israel
into
the
wilderness
and
he
came
to
jahaz
and
fought
against
israel
and
israel
smote
him
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
possessed
his
land
from
arnon
unto
jabbok
even
unto
the
children
of
ammon
for
the
border
of
the
children
of
ammon
was
strong
and
israel
took
all
these
cities
and
israel
dwelt
in
all
the
cities
of
the
amorites
in
heshbon
and
in
all
the
villages
thereof
for
heshbon
was
the
city
of
sihon
the
king
of
the
amorites
who
had
fought
against
the
former
king
of
moab
and
taken
all
his
land
out
of
his
hand
even
unto
arnon
wherefore
they
that
speak
in
proverbs
say
come
into
heshbon
let
the
city
of
sihon
be
built
and
prepared
for
there
is
a
fire
gone
out
of
heshbon
a
flame
from
the
city
of
sihon
it
hath
consumed
ar
of
moab
and
the
lords
of
the
high
places
of
arnon
woe
to
thee
moab
thou
art
undone
o
people
of
chemosh
he
hath
given
his
sons
that
escaped
and
his
daughters
into
captivity
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
we
have
shot
at
them
heshbon
is
perished
even
unto
dibon
and
we
have
laid
them
waste
even
unto
nophah
which
reacheth
unto
medeba
thus
israel
dwelt
in
the
land
of
the
amorites
and
moses
sent
to
spy
out
jaazer
and
they
took
the
villages
thereof
and
drove
out
the
amorites
that
were
there
and
they
turned
and
went
up
by
the
way
of
bashan
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
went
out
against
them
he
and
all
his
people
to
the
battle
at
edrei
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
fear
him
not
for
i
have
delivered
him
into
thy
hand
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
and
thou
shalt
do
to
him
as
thou
didst
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
at
heshbon
so
they
smote
him
and
his
sons
and
all
his
people
until
there
was
none
left
him
alive
and
they
possessed
his
land
and
the
children
of
israel
set
forward
and
pitched
in
the
plains
of
moab
on
this
side
jordan
by
jericho
and
balak
the
son
of
zippor
saw
all
that
israel
had
done
to
the
amorites
and
moab
was
sore
afraid
of
the
people
because
they
were
many
and
moab
was
distressed
because
of
the
children
of
israel
and
moab
said
unto
the
elders
of
midian
now
shall
this
company
lick
up
all
that
are
round
about
us
as
the
ox
licketh
up
the
grass
of
the
field
and
balak
the
son
of
zippor
was
king
of
the
moabites
at
that
time
he
sent
messengers
therefore
unto
balaam
the
son
of
beor
to
pethor
which
is
by
the
river
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
his
people
to
call
him
saying
behold
there
is
a
people
come
out
from
egypt
behold
they
cover
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
abide
over
against
me
come
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
curse
me
this
people
for
they
are
too
mighty
for
me
peradventure
i
shall
prevail
that
we
may
smite
them
and
that
i
may
drive
them
out
of
the
land
for
i
wot
that
he
whom
thou
blessest
is
blessed
and
he
whom
thou
cursest
is
cursed
and
the
elders
of
moab
and
the
elders
of
midian
departed
with
the
rewards
of
divination
in
their
hand
and
they
came
unto
balaam
and
spake
unto
him
the
words
of
balak
and
he
said
unto
them
lodge
here
this
night
and
i
will
bring
you
word
again
as
the
lord
shall
speak
unto
me
and
the
princes
of
moab
abode
with
balaam
and
god
came
unto
balaam
and
said
what
men
are
these
with
thee
and
balaam
said
unto
god
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
hath
sent
unto
me
saying
behold
there
is
a
people
come
out
of
egypt
which
covereth
the
face
of
the
earth
come
now
curse
me
them
peradventure
i
shall
be
able
to
overcome
them
and
drive
them
out
and
god
said
unto
balaam
thou
shalt
not
go
with
them
thou
shalt
not
curse
the
people
for
they
are
blessed
and
balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
said
unto
the
princes
of
balak
get
you
into
your
land
for
the
lord
refuseth
to
give
me
leave
to
go
with
you
and
the
princes
of
moab
rose
up
and
they
went
unto
balak
and
said
balaam
refuseth
to
come
with
us
and
balak
sent
yet
again
princes
more
and
more
honourable
than
they
and
they
came
to
balaam
and
said
to
him
thus
saith
balak
the
son
of
zippor
let
nothing
i
pray
thee
hinder
thee
from
coming
unto
me
for
i
will
promote
thee
unto
very
great
honour
and
i
will
do
whatsoever
thou
sayest
unto
me
come
therefore
i
pray
thee
curse
me
this
people
and
balaam
answered
and
said
unto
the
servants
of
balak
if
balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
i
cannot
go
beyond
the
word
of
the
lord
my
god
to
do
less
or
more
now
therefore
i
pray
you
tarry
ye
also
here
this
night
that
i
may
know
what
the
lord
will
say
unto
me
more
and
god
came
unto
balaam
at
night
and
said
unto
him
if
the
men
come
to
call
thee
rise
up
and
go
with
them
but
yet
the
word
which
i
shall
say
unto
thee
that
shalt
thou
do
and
balaam
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
with
the
princes
of
moab
and
god's
anger
was
kindled
because
he
went
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
in
the
way
for
an
adversary
against
him
now
he
was
riding
upon
his
ass
and
his
two
servants
were
with
him
and
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
standing
in
the
way
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
the
ass
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
and
went
into
the
field
and
balaam
smote
the
ass
to
turn
her
into
the
way
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
in
a
path
of
the
vineyards
a
wall
being
on
this
side
and
a
wall
on
that
side
and
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
she
thrust
herself
unto
the
wall
and
crushed
balaam's
foot
against
the
wall
and
he
smote
her
again
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
further
and
stood
in
a
narrow
place
where
was
no
way
to
turn
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
and
when
the
ass
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
she
fell
down
under
balaam
and
balaam's
anger
was
kindled
and
he
smote
the
ass
with
a
staff
and
the
lord
opened
the
mouth
of
the
ass
and
she
said
unto
balaam
what
have
i
done
unto
thee
that
thou
hast
smitten
me
these
three
times
and
balaam
said
unto
the
ass
because
thou
hast
mocked
me
i
would
there
were
a
sword
in
mine
hand
for
now
would
i
kill
thee
and
the
ass
said
unto
balaam
am
not
i
thine
ass
upon
which
thou
hast
ridden
ever
since
i
was
thine
unto
this
day
was
i
ever
wont
to
do
so
unto
thee
and
he
said
nay
then
the
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
balaam
and
he
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
standing
in
the
way
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
he
bowed
down
his
head
and
fell
flat
on
his
face
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherefore
hast
thou
smitten
thine
ass
these
three
times
behold
i
went
out
to
withstand
thee
because
thy
way
is
perverse
before
me
and
the
ass
saw
me
and
turned
from
me
these
three
times
unless
she
had
turned
from
me
surely
now
also
i
had
slain
thee
and
saved
her
alive
and
balaam
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
i
have
sinned
for
i
knew
not
that
thou
stoodest
in
the
way
against
me
now
therefore
if
it
displease
thee
i
will
get
me
back
again
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
balaam
go
with
the
men
but
only
the
word
that
i
shall
speak
unto
thee
that
thou
shalt
speak
so
balaam
went
with
the
princes
of
balak
and
when
balak
heard
that
balaam
was
come
he
went
out
to
meet
him
unto
a
city
of
moab
which
is
in
the
border
of
arnon
which
is
in
the
utmost
coast
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
did
i
not
earnestly
send
unto
thee
to
call
thee
wherefore
camest
thou
not
unto
me
am
i
not
able
indeed
to
promote
thee
to
honour
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
lo
i
am
come
unto
thee
have
i
now
any
power
at
all
to
say
any
thing
the
word
that
god
putteth
in
my
mouth
that
shall
i
speak
and
balaam
went
with
balak
and
they
came
unto
kirjathhuzoth
and
balak
offered
oxen
and
sheep
and
sent
to
balaam
and
to
the
princes
that
were
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
balak
took
balaam
and
brought
him
up
into
the
high
places
of
baal
that
thence
he
might
see
the
utmost
part
of
the
people
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
build
me
here
seven
altars
and
prepare
me
here
seven
oxen
and
seven
rams
and
balak
did
as
balaam
had
spoken
and
balak
and
balaam
offered
on
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
stand
by
thy
burnt
offering
and
i
will
go
peradventure
the
lord
will
come
to
meet
me
and
whatsoever
he
sheweth
me
i
will
tell
thee
and
he
went
to
an
high
place
and
god
met
balaam
and
he
said
unto
him
i
have
prepared
seven
altars
and
i
have
offered
upon
every
altar
a
bullock
and
a
ram
and
the
lord
put
a
word
in
balaam's
mouth
and
said
return
unto
balak
and
thus
thou
shalt
speak
and
he
returned
unto
him
and
lo
he
stood
by
his
burnt
sacrifice
he
and
all
the
princes
of
moab
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balak
the
king
of
moab
hath
brought
me
from
aram
out
of
the
mountains
of
the
east
saying
come
curse
me
jacob
and
come
defy
israel
how
shall
i
curse
whom
god
hath
not
cursed
or
how
shall
i
defy
whom
the
lord
hath
not
defied
for
from
the
top
of
the
rocks
i
see
him
and
from
the
hills
i
behold
him
lo
the
people
shall
dwell
alone
and
shall
not
be
reckoned
among
the
nations
who
can
count
the
dust
of
jacob
and
the
number
of
the
fourth
part
of
israel
let
me
die
the
death
of
the
righteous
and
let
my
last
end
be
like
his
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
what
hast
thou
done
unto
me
i
took
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies
and
behold
thou
hast
blessed
them
altogether
and
he
answered
and
said
must
i
not
take
heed
to
speak
that
which
the
lord
hath
put
in
my
mouth
and
balak
said
unto
him
come
i
pray
thee
with
me
unto
another
place
from
whence
thou
mayest
see
them
thou
shalt
see
but
the
utmost
part
of
them
and
shalt
not
see
them
all
and
curse
me
them
from
thence
and
he
brought
him
into
the
field
of
zophim
to
the
top
of
pisgah
and
built
seven
altars
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar
and
he
said
unto
balak
stand
here
by
thy
burnt
offering
while
i
meet
the
lord
yonder
and
the
lord
met
balaam
and
put
a
word
in
his
mouth
and
said
go
again
unto
balak
and
say
thus
and
when
he
came
to
him
behold
he
stood
by
his
burnt
offering
and
the
princes
of
moab
with
him
and
balak
said
unto
him
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
rise
up
balak
and
hear
hearken
unto
me
thou
son
of
zippor
god
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
lie
neither
the
son
of
man
that
he
should
repent
hath
he
said
and
shall
he
not
do
it
or
hath
he
spoken
and
shall
he
not
make
it
good
behold
i
have
received
commandment
to
bless
and
he
hath
blessed
and
i
cannot
reverse
it
he
hath
not
beheld
iniquity
in
jacob
neither
hath
he
seen
perverseness
in
israel
the
lord
his
god
is
with
him
and
the
shout
of
a
king
is
among
them
god
brought
them
out
of
egypt
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn
surely
there
is
no
enchantment
against
jacob
neither
is
there
any
divination
against
israel
according
to
this
time
it
shall
be
said
of
jacob
and
of
israel
what
hath
god
wrought
behold
the
people
shall
rise
up
as
a
great
lion
and
lift
up
himself
as
a
young
lion
he
shall
not
lie
down
until
he
eat
of
the
prey
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
neither
curse
them
at
all
nor
bless
them
at
all
but
balaam
answered
and
said
unto
balak
told
not
i
thee
saying
all
that
the
lord
speaketh
that
i
must
do
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
come
i
pray
thee
i
will
bring
thee
unto
another
place
peradventure
it
will
please
god
that
thou
mayest
curse
me
them
from
thence
and
balak
brought
balaam
unto
the
top
of
peor
that
looketh
toward
jeshimon
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
build
me
here
seven
altars
and
prepare
me
here
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
and
balak
did
as
balaam
had
said
and
offered
a
bullock
and
a
ram
on
every
altar
and
when
balaam
saw
that
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bless
israel
he
went
not
as
at
other
times
to
seek
for
enchantments
but
he
set
his
face
toward
the
wilderness
and
balaam
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
he
saw
israel
abiding
in
his
tents
according
to
their
tribes
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
him
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balaam
the
son
of
beor
hath
said
and
the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said
he
hath
said
which
heard
the
words
of
god
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
almighty
falling
into
a
trance
but
having
his
eyes
open
how
goodly
are
thy
tents
o
jacob
and
thy
tabernacles
o
israel
as
the
valleys
are
they
spread
forth
as
gardens
by
the
river's
side
as
the
trees
of
lign
aloes
which
the
lord
hath
planted
and
as
cedar
trees
beside
the
waters
he
shall
pour
the
water
out
of
his
buckets
and
his
seed
shall
be
in
many
waters
and
his
king
shall
be
higher
than
agag
and
his
kingdom
shall
be
exalted
god
brought
him
forth
out
of
egypt
he
hath
as
it
were
the
strength
of
an
unicorn
he
shall
eat
up
the
nations
his
enemies
and
shall
break
their
bones
and
pierce
them
through
with
his
arrows
he
couched
he
lay
down
as
a
lion
and
as
a
great
lion
who
shall
stir
him
up
blessed
is
he
that
blesseth
thee
and
cursed
is
he
that
curseth
thee
and
balak's
anger
was
kindled
against
balaam
and
he
smote
his
hands
together
and
balak
said
unto
balaam
i
called
thee
to
curse
mine
enemies
and
behold
thou
hast
altogether
blessed
them
these
three
times
therefore
now
flee
thou
to
thy
place
i
thought
to
promote
thee
unto
great
honour
but
lo
the
lord
hath
kept
thee
back
from
honour
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
spake
i
not
also
to
thy
messengers
which
thou
sentest
unto
me
saying
if
balak
would
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
i
cannot
go
beyond
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
do
either
good
or
bad
of
mine
own
mind
but
what
the
lord
saith
that
will
i
speak
and
now
behold
i
go
unto
my
people
come
therefore
and
i
will
advertise
thee
what
this
people
shall
do
to
thy
people
in
the
latter
days
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
balaam
the
son
of
beor
hath
said
and
the
man
whose
eyes
are
open
hath
said
he
hath
said
which
heard
the
words
of
god
and
knew
the
knowledge
of
the
most
high
which
saw
the
vision
of
the
almighty
falling
into
a
trance
but
having
his
eyes
open
i
shall
see
him
but
not
now
i
shall
behold
him
but
not
nigh
there
shall
come
a
star
out
of
jacob
and
a
sceptre
shall
rise
out
of
israel
and
shall
smite
the
corners
of
moab
and
destroy
all
the
children
of
sheth
and
edom
shall
be
a
possession
seir
also
shall
be
a
possession
for
his
enemies
and
israel
shall
do
valiantly
out
of
jacob
shall
come
he
that
shall
have
dominion
and
shall
destroy
him
that
remaineth
of
the
city
and
when
he
looked
on
amalek
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
amalek
was
the
first
of
the
nations
but
his
latter
end
shall
be
that
he
perish
for
ever
and
he
looked
on
the
kenites
and
took
up
his
parable
and
said
strong
is
thy
dwellingplace
and
thou
puttest
thy
nest
in
a
rock
nevertheless
the
kenite
shall
be
wasted
until
asshur
shall
carry
thee
away
captive
and
he
took
up
his
parable
and
said
alas
who
shall
live
when
god
doeth
this
and
ships
shall
come
from
the
coast
of
chittim
and
shall
afflict
asshur
and
shall
afflict
eber
and
he
also
shall
perish
for
ever
and
balaam
rose
up
and
went
and
returned
to
his
place
and
balak
also
went
his
way
and
israel
abode
in
shittim
and
the
people
began
to
commit
whoredom
with
the
daughters
of
moab
and
they
called
the
people
unto
the
sacrifices
of
their
gods
and
the
people
did
eat
and
bowed
down
to
their
gods
and
israel
joined
himself
unto
baalpeor
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
take
all
the
heads
of
the
people
and
hang
them
up
before
the
lord
against
the
sun
that
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
may
be
turned
away
from
israel
and
moses
said
unto
the
judges
of
israel
slay
ye
every
one
his
men
that
were
joined
unto
baalpeor
and
behold
one
of
the
children
of
israel
came
and
brought
unto
his
brethren
a
midianitish
woman
in
the
sight
of
moses
and
in
the
sight
of
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
who
were
weeping
before
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
when
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
the
priest
saw
it
he
rose
up
from
among
the
congregation
and
took
a
javelin
in
his
hand
and
he
went
after
the
man
of
israel
into
the
tent
and
thrust
both
of
them
through
the

give

right
thou

thou
shalt
cause
the

to

and
thou
shalt
speak
unto

saying
if

then
ye
shall
cause

unto

have
no

then
ye
shall
give
his
inheritance
unto
his
kinsman
that
is
next
to
him
of

he
shall
possess
it

it

get

it
thou
also
shalt
be
gathered
unto

thy

ye
rebelled
against

to
sanctify
me
at
the
water
before
their
eyes
that
is
the
water
of
meribah
in
kadesh
in
the
wilderness
of

and
moses
spake
unto
the
lord
saying
let
the
lord
the
god
of
the
spirits
of
all
flesh
set
a
man
over
the
congregation
which
may
go
out
before
them
and
which
may
go
in
before
them
and
which
may
lead
them
out
and
which
may
bring
them
in
that
the
congregation
of
the
lord
be
not
as
sheep
which
have
no
shepherd
and
the

said
unto

take
thee
joshua
the
son
of

a
man
in

is
the
spirit
and
lay
thine
hand
upon

him

give
him
a

in

sight
and
thou
shalt
put
some
of
thine
honour
upon
him
that
all
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
may
be
obedient
and
he
shall
stand
before
eleazar
the
priest
who
shall
ask
counsel
for
him
after
the
judgment
of
urim
before
the
lord
at
his
word
shall
they
go
out

at

they
shall
come
in
both
he
and
all
the

him
even

there
lacketh

shekels
for
the

the

took

of
hundreds
and
brought
it
into
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
for
a
memorial
for
the
children
of

before
the
lord
now
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
had
a
very
great
multitude
of
cattle
and
when
they
saw
the
land
of
jazer
and
the
land
of
gilead
that
behold
the
place
was
a
place
for
cattle
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
came
and
spake
unto
moses
and
to
eleazar
the
priest
and
unto
the
princes
of
the
congregation
saying
ataroth
and
dibon
and
jazer
and
nimrah
and
heshbon
and
elealeh
and
shebam
and
nebo
and
beon
even
the
country
which
the
lord
smote
before
the
congregation
of
israel
is
a
land
for
cattle
and
thy
servants
have
cattle
wherefore
said
they
if
we
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
let
this
land
be
given
unto
thy
servants
for
a
possession
and
bring
us
not
over
jordan
and
moses
said
unto
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
children
of
reuben
shall
your
brethren
go
to
war
and
shall
ye
sit
here
and
wherefore
discourage
ye
the
heart
of
the
children
of
israel
from
going
over
into
the
land
which
the
lord
hath
given
them
thus
did
your
fathers
when
i
sent
them
from
kadeshbarnea
to
see
the
land
for
when
they
went
up
unto
the
valley
of
eshcol
and
saw
the
land
they
discouraged
the
heart
of
the
children
of
israel
that
they
should
not
go
into
the
land
which
the
lord
had
given
them
and
the
lord's
anger
was
kindled
the
same
time
and
he
sware
saying
surely
none
of
the
men
that
came
up
out
of
egypt
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
shall
see
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
because
they
have
not
wholly
followed
me
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
for
they
have
wholly
followed
the
lord
and
the
lord's
anger
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
made
them
wander
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
until
all
the
generation
that
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
was
consumed
and
behold
ye
are
risen
up
in
your
fathers
stead
an
increase
of
sinful
men
to
augment
yet
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord
toward
israel
for
if
ye
turn
away
from
after
him
he
will
yet
again
leave
them
in
the
wilderness
and
ye
shall
destroy
all
this
people
and
they
came
near
unto
him
and
said
we
will
build
sheepfolds
here
for
our
cattle
and
cities
for
our
little
ones
but
we
ourselves
will
go
ready
armed
before
the
children
of
israel
until
we
have
brought
them
unto
their
place
and
our
little
ones
shall
dwell
in
the
fenced
cities
because
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
we
will
not
return
unto
our
houses
until
the
children
of
israel
have
inherited
every
man
his
inheritance
for
we
will
not
inherit
with
them
on
yonder
side
jordan
or
forward
because
our
inheritance
is
fallen
to
us
on
this
side
jordan
eastward
and
moses
said
unto
them
if
ye
will
do
this
thing
if
ye
will
go
armed
before
the
lord
to
war
and
will
go
all
of
you
armed
over
jordan
before
the
lord
until
he
hath
driven
out
his
enemies
from
before
him
and
the
land
be
subdued
before
the
lord
then
afterward
ye
shall
return
and
be
guiltless
before
the
lord
and
before
israel
and
this
land
shall
be
your
possession
before
the
lord
but
if
ye
will
not
do
so
behold
ye
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
be
sure
your
sin
will
find
you
out
build
you
cities
for
your
little
ones
and
folds
for
your
sheep
and
do
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
your
mouth
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
spake
unto
moses
saying
thy
servants
will
do
as
my
lord
commandeth
our
little
ones
our
wives
our
flocks
and
all
our
cattle
shall
be
there
in
the
cities
of
gilead
but
thy
servants
will
pass
over
every
man
armed
for
war
before
the
lord
to
battle
as
my
lord
saith
so
concerning
them
moses
commanded
eleazar
the
priest
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
the
chief
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
and
moses
said
unto
them
if
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
will
pass
with
you
over
jordan
every
man
armed
to
battle
before
the
lord
and
the
land
shall
be
subdued
before
you
then
ye
shall
give
them
the
land
of
gilead
for
a
possession
but
if
they
will
not
pass
over
with
you
armed
they
shall
have
possessions
among
you
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
reuben
answered
saying
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thy
servants
so
will
we
do
we
will
pass
over
armed
before
the
lord
into
the
land
of
canaan
that
the
possession
of
our
inheritance
on
this
side
jordan
may
be
ours

moreover
ye
shall
take
no
satisfaction
for
the
life
of
a

take
no
satisfaction
for
him
that

the
city
of
his
refuge
that
he
should
come
again
to
dwell
in
the
land
until
the
death
of
the
priest
so
ye
shall
not
pollute
the
land
wherein
ye
are
for

it
defileth
the
land
and

therein
but
by
the
blood
of
him
that
shed

the

and
they
said
the

commanded
my

to
give
the
land
for
an
inheritance
by
lot
to
the
children
of
israel
and
my

and
if
they
be

then
shall
their

and
when

shall
be
then
shall
their
inheritance
be
put
unto
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
whereunto
they
are
received
so
shall
their
inheritance
be
taken
away
from
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
our
fathers
and
moses
commanded
the
children
of
israel
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
joseph
hath
said
well
this
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
doth
command
concerning
the
daughters
of
zelophehad
saying
let
them
marry
to
whom
they
think
best
only
to
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
their
father
shall
they
marry
so
shall
not
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
israel
remove
from
tribe
to
tribe
for
every
one
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
himself
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
his
fathers
and
every
daughter
that
possesseth
an
inheritance
in
any
tribe
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
be
wife
unto
one
of
the
family
of
the
tribe
of
her
father
that
the
children
of
israel
may
enjoy
every
man
the
inheritance
of
his
fathers
neither
shall
the
inheritance
remove
from
one
tribe
to
another
tribe
but
every
one
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
himself
to
his
own
inheritance
even
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
did
the
daughters
of
zelophehad
for
mahlah
tirzah
and
hoglah
and
milcah
and
noah
the
daughters
of
zelophehad
were
married
unto
their
father's
brothers
sons
and
they
were
married
into
the
families
of
the
sons
of
manasseh
the
son
of
joseph
and
their
inheritance
remained
in
the
tribe
of
the
family
of
their
father
these
are
the
commandments
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
commanded
by
the
hand
of
moses
unto
the
children
of
israel
in
the
plains
of
moab
by

near

the
fifth
book
of

these
be
the
words
which
moses
spake
unto
all
israel
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
wilderness
in
the
plain
over
against
the
red
sea
between

and
dizahab
there
are
eleven
days
journey
from

by
the
way
of
mount
seir
unto

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fortieth
year
in
the
eleventh
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
according
unto
all
that
the
lord
had
given
him
in
commandment
unto
them
after
he
had
slain
sihon
the
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
heshbon
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
which
dwelt
at
astaroth
in
edrei
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
land
of
moab
began
moses
to
declare
this
law
saying
the
lord
our
god
spake
unto
us
in
horeb
saying
ye
have
dwelt
long
enough
in
this
mount
turn
you
and
take
your
journey
and
go
to
the
mount
of
the
amorites
and
unto
all
the
places
nigh
thereunto
in
the
plain
in
the
hills
and
in
the
vale
and
in
the
south
and
by
the
sea
side
to
the
land
of
the
canaanites
and
unto
lebanon
unto
the
great
river
the
river
euphrates
behold
i
have
set
the
land
before
you
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
after
them
and
i
spake
unto
you
at
that
time
saying
i
am
not
able
to
bear
you
myself
alone
the
lord
your
god
hath
multiplied
you
and
behold
ye
are
this
day
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
make
you
a
thousand
times
so
many
more
as
ye
are
and
bless
you
as
he
hath
promised
you
how
can
i
myself
alone
bear
your
cumbrance
and
your
burden
and
your
strife
take
you
wise
men
and
understanding
and
known
among
your
tribes
and
i
will
make
them
rulers
over
you
and
ye
answered
me
and
said
the
thing
which
thou
hast
spoken
is
good
for
us
to
do
so
i
took
the
chief
of
your
tribes
wise
men
and
known
and
made
them
heads
over
you
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
hundreds
and
captains
over
fifties
and
captains
over
tens
and
officers
among
your
tribes
and
i
charged
your
judges
at
that
time
saying
hear
the
causes
between
your
brethren
and
judge
righteously
between
every
man
and
his
brother
and
the
stranger
that
is
with
him
ye
shall
not
respect
persons
in
judgment
but
ye
shall
hear
the
small
as
well
as
the
great
ye
shall
not
be
afraid
of
the
face
of
man
for
the
judgment
is
god's
and
the
cause
that
is
too
hard
for
you
bring
it
unto
me
and
i
will
hear
it
and
i
commanded
you
at
that
time
all
the
things
which
ye
should
do
and
when
we
departed
from
horeb
we
went
through
all
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness
which
ye
saw
by
the
way
of
the
mountain
of
the
amorites
as
the
lord
our
god
commanded
us
and
we
came
to
kadeshbarnea
and
i
said
unto
you
ye
are
come
unto
the
mountain
of
the
amorites
which
the
lord
our
god
doth
give
unto
us
behold
the
lord
thy
god
hath
set
the
land
before
thee
go
up
and
possess
it
as
the
lord
god
of
thy
fathers
hath
said
unto
thee
fear
not
neither
be
discouraged
and
ye
came
near
unto
me
every
one
of
you
and
said
we
will
send
men
before
us
and
they
shall
search
us
out
the
land
and
bring
us
word
again
by
what
way
we
must
go
up
and
into
what
cities
we
shall
come
and
the
saying
pleased
me
well
and
i
took
twelve
men
of
you
one
of
a
tribe
and
they
turned
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
came
unto
the
valley
of
eshcol
and
searched
it
out
and
they
took
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
in
their
hands
and
brought
it
down
unto
us
and
brought
us
word
again
and
said
it
is
a
good
land
which
the
lord
our
god
doth
give
us
notwithstanding
ye
would
not
go
up
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
god
and
ye
murmured
in
your
tents
and
said
because
the
lord
hated
us
he
hath
brought
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
amorites
to
destroy
us
whither
shall
we
go
up
our
brethren
have
discouraged
our
heart
saying
the
people
is
greater
and
taller
than
we
the
cities
are
great
and
walled
up
to
heaven
and
moreover
we
have
seen
the
sons
of
the
anakims
there
then
i
said
unto
you
dread
not
neither
be
afraid
of
them
the
lord
your
god
which
goeth
before
you
he
shall
fight
for
you
according
to
all
that
he
did
for
you
in
egypt
before
your
eyes
and
in
the
wilderness
where
thou
hast
seen
how
that
the
lord
thy
god
bare
thee
as
a
man
doth
bear
his
son
in
all
the
way
that
ye
went
until
ye
came
into
this
place
yet
in
this
thing
ye
did
not
believe
the
lord
your
god
who
went
in
the
way
before
you
to
search
you
out
a
place
to
pitch
your
tents
in
in
fire
by
night
to
shew
you
by
what
way
ye
should
go
and
in
a
cloud
by
day
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
your
words
and
was
wroth
and
sware
saying
surely
there
shall
not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
see
that
good
land
which
i
sware
to
give
unto
your
fathers
save
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
he
shall
see
it
and
to
him
will
i
give
the
land
that
he
hath
trodden
upon
and
to
his
children
because
he
hath
wholly
followed
the
lord
also
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
sakes
saying
thou
also
shalt
not
go
in
thither
but
joshua
the
son
of
nun
which
standeth
before
thee
he
shall
go
in
thither
encourage
him
for
he
shall
cause
israel
to
inherit
it
moreover
your
little
ones
which
ye
said
should
be
a
prey
and
your
children
which
in
that
day
had
no
knowledge
between
good
and
evil
they
shall
go
in
thither
and
unto
them
will
i
give
it
and
they
shall
possess
it
but
as
for
you
turn
you
and
take
your
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
then
ye
answered
and
said
unto
me
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
we
will
go
up
and
fight
according
to
all
that
the
lord
our
god
commanded
us
and
when
ye
had
girded
on
every
man
his
weapons
of
war
ye
were
ready
to
go
up
into
the
hill
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
say
unto
them
go
not
up
neither
fight
for
i
am
not
among
you
lest
ye
be
smitten
before
your
enemies
so
i
spake
unto
you
and
ye
would
not
hear
but
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
went
presumptuously
up
into
the
hill
and
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
that
mountain
came
out
against
you
and
chased
you
as
bees
do
and
destroyed
you
in
seir
even
unto
hormah
and
ye
returned
and
wept
before
the
lord
but
the
lord
would
not
hearken
to
your
voice
nor
give
ear
unto
you
so
ye
abode
in
kadesh
many
days
according
unto
the
days
that
ye
abode
there
then
we
turned
and
took
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
as
the
lord
spake
unto
me
and
we
compassed
mount
seir
many
days
and
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
ye
have
compassed
this
mountain
long
enough
turn
you
northward
and
command
thou
the
people
saying
ye
are
to
pass
through
the
coast
of
your
brethren
the
children
of
esau
which
dwell
in
seir
and
they
shall
be
afraid
of
you
take
ye
good
heed
unto
yourselves
therefore
meddle
not
with
them
for
i
will
not
give
you
of
their
land
no
not
so
much
as
a
foot
breadth
because
i
have
given
mount
seir
unto
esau
for
a
possession
ye
shall
buy
meat
of
them
for
money
that
ye
may
eat
and
ye
shall
also
buy
water
of
them
for
money
that
ye
may
drink
for
the
lord
thy
god
hath
blessed
thee
in
all
the
works
of
thy
hand
he
knoweth
thy
walking
through
this
great
wilderness
these
forty
years
the
lord
thy
god
hath
been
with
thee
thou
hast
lacked
nothing
and
when
we
passed
by
from
our
brethren
the
children
of
esau
which
dwelt
in
seir
through
the
way
of
the
plain
from
elath
and
from
eziongaber
we
turned
and
passed
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
moab
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
distress
not
the
moabites
neither
contend
with
them
in
battle
for
i
will
not
give
thee
of
their
land
for
a
possession
because
i
have
given
ar
unto
the
children
of
lot
for
a
possession
the
emims
dwelt
therein
in
times
past
a
people
great
and
many
and
tall
as
the
anakims
which
also
were
accounted
giants
as
the
anakims
but
the
moabites
called
them
emims
the
horims
also
dwelt
in
seir
beforetime
but
the
children
of
esau
succeeded
them
when
they
had
destroyed
them
from
before
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
as
israel
did
unto
the
land
of
his
possession
which
the
lord
gave
unto
them
now
rise
up
said
i
and
get
you
over
the
brook
zered
and
we
went
over
the
brook
zered
and
the
space
in
which
we
came
from
kadeshbarnea
until
we
were
come
over
the
brook
zered
was
thirty
and
eight
years
until
all
the
generation
of
the
men
of
war
were
wasted
out
from
among
the
host
as
the
lord
sware
unto
them
for
indeed
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
to
destroy
them
from
among
the
host
until
they
were
consumed
so
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
men
of
war
were
consumed
and
dead
from
among
the
people
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
thou
art
to
pass
over
through
ar
the
coast
of
moab
this
day
and
when
thou
comest
nigh
over
against
the
children
of
ammon
distress
them
not
nor
meddle
with
them
for
i
will
not
give
thee
of
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
any
possession
because
i
have
given
it
unto
the
children
of
lot
for
a
possession
that
also
was
accounted
a
land
of
giants
giants
dwelt
therein
in
old
time
and
the
ammonites
call
them
zamzummims
a
people
great
and
many
and
tall
as
the
anakims
but
the
lord
destroyed
them
before
them
and
they
succeeded
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
as
he
did
to
the
children
of
esau
which
dwelt
in
seir
when
he
destroyed
the
horims
from
before
them
and
they
succeeded
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
even
unto
this
day
and
the
avims
which
dwelt
in
hazerim
even
unto
azzah
the
caphtorims
which
came
forth
out
of
caphtor
destroyed
them
and
dwelt
in
their
stead
rise
ye
up
take
your
journey
and
pass
over
the
river
arnon
behold
i
have
given
into
thine
hand
sihon
the
amorite
king
of
heshbon
and
his
land
begin
to
possess
it
and
contend
with
him
in
battle
this
day
will
i
begin
to
put
the
dread
of
thee
and
the
fear
of
thee
upon
the
nations
that
are
under
the
whole
heaven
who
shall
hear
report
of
thee
and
shall
tremble
and
be
in
anguish
because
of
thee
and
i
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
of
kedemoth
unto
sihon
king
of
heshbon
with
words
of
peace
saying
let
me
pass
through
thy
land
i
will
go
along
by
the
high
way
i
will
neither
turn
unto
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
thou
shalt
sell
me
meat
for
money
that
i
may
eat
and
give
me
water
for
money
that
i
may
drink
only
i
will
pass
through
on
my
feet
as
the
children
of
esau
which
dwell
in
seir
and
the
moabites
which
dwell
in
ar
did
unto
me
until
i
shall
pass
over
jordan
into
the
land
which
the
lord
our
god
giveth
us
but
sihon
king
of
heshbon
would
not
let
us
pass
by
him
for
the
lord
thy
god
hardened
his
spirit
and
made
his
heart
obstinate
that
he
might
deliver
him
into
thy
hand
as
appeareth
this
day
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
behold
i
have
begun
to
give
sihon
and
his
land
before
thee
begin
to
possess
that
thou
mayest
inherit
his
land
then
sihon
came
out
against
us
he
and
all
his
people
to
fight
at
jahaz
and
the
lord
our
god
delivered
him
before
us
and
we
smote
him
and
his
sons
and
all
his
people
and
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
time
and
utterly
destroyed
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
little
ones
of
every
city
we
left
none
to
remain
only
the
cattle
we
took
for
a
prey
unto
ourselves
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
which
we
took
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
brink
of
the
river
of
arnon
and
from
the
city
that
is
by
the
river
even
unto
gilead
there
was
not
one
city
too
strong
for
us
the
lord
our
god
delivered
all
unto
us
only
unto
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
thou
camest
not
nor
unto
any
place
of
the
river
jabbok
nor
unto
the
cities
in
the
mountains
nor
unto
whatsoever
the
lord
our
god
forbad
us
then
we
turned
and
went
up
the
way
to
bashan
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
came
out
against
us
he
and
all
his
people
to
battle
at
edrei
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
fear
him
not
for
i
will
deliver
him
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
into
thy
hand
and
thou
shalt
do
unto
him
as
thou
didst
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
at
heshbon
so
the
lord
our
god
delivered
into
our
hands
og
also
the
king
of
bashan
and
all
his
people
and
we
smote
him
until
none
was
left
to
him
remaining
and
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
time
there
was
not
a
city
which
we
took
not
from
them
threescore
cities
all
the
region
of
argob
the
kingdom
of
og
in
bashan
all
these
cities
were
fenced
with
high
walls
gates
and
bars
beside
unwalled
towns
a
great
many
and
we
utterly
destroyed
them
as
we
did
unto
sihon
king
of
heshbon
utterly
destroying
the
men
women
and
children
of
every
city
but
all
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
we
took
for
a
prey
to
ourselves
and
we
took
at
that
time
out
of
the
hand
of
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
the
land
that
was
on
this
side
jordan
from
the
river
of

plain
and
all
gilead
and
all
bashan
unto
salchah
and
edrei
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
og
in
bashan
for
only
og
king
of
bashan
remained
of
the
remnant
of
giants
behold
his
bedstead
was
a
bedstead
of
iron

in
rabbath
of
the
children
of
ammon
nine
cubits

the
length
thereof
and
four

breadth
of
it
after
the
cubit
of
a

that
time
from

the
reubenites
and

the
gadites
and

all
the
region
of
argob
with
all
bashan
which
was
called
the
land
of
giants
jair
the
son
of
manasseh
took
all
the
country
of
argob
unto
the
coasts
of
geshuri
and
maachathi
and
called
them
after
his
own
name
bashanhavothjair
unto
this
day
and
i
gave
gilead
unto
machir
and
unto
the
reubenites
and
unto
the
gadites
i
gave
from
gilead
even
unto
the
river
arnon
half
the
valley
and
the
border
even
unto
the
river
jabbok
which
is
the
border
of
the
children
of
ammon
the
plain
also
and
jordan
and
the
coast
thereof
from
chinnereth
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain
even
the
salt
sea
under
ashdothpisgah
eastward
and
i
commanded
you
at
that
time
saying
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
this
land
to
possess
it
ye
shall
pass
over
armed
before
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
all
that
are
meet
for
the
war
but
your
wives
and
your
little
ones
and
your
cattle
for
i
know
that
ye
have
much
cattle
shall
abide
in
your
cities
which
i
have
given
you
until
the
lord
have
given
rest
unto
your
brethren
as
well
as
unto
you
and
until
they
also
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
them
beyond
jordan
and
then
shall
ye
return
every
man
unto
his
possession
which
i
have
given
you
and
i
commanded
joshua
at
that
time
saying
thine
eyes
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
your
god
hath
done
unto
these
two
kings
so
shall
the
lord
do
unto
all
the
kingdoms
whither
thou
passest
ye
shall
not
fear
them
for
the
lord
your
god
he
shall
fight
for
you
and
i
besought
the
lord
at
that
time
saying
o
lord
god
thou
hast
begun
to
shew
thy
servant
thy
greatness
and
thy
mighty
hand
for
what
god
is
there
in
heaven
or
in
earth
that
can
do
according
to
thy
works
and
according
to
thy
might
i
pray
thee
let
me
go
over
and
see
the
good
land
that
is
beyond
jordan
that
goodly
mountain
and
lebanon
but
the
lord
was
wroth
with
me
for
your
sakes
and
would
not
hear
me
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
let
it
suffice
thee
speak
no
more
unto
me
of
this
matter
get
thee
up
into
the
top
of
pisgah
and
lift
up
thine
eyes
westward
and
northward
and
southward
and
eastward
and
behold
it
with
thine
eyes
for
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
jordan
but
charge
joshua
and
encourage
him
and
strengthen
him
for
he
shall
go
over
before
this
people
and
he
shall
cause
them
to
inherit
the
land
which
thou
shalt
see
so
we
abode
in
the
valley
over
against
bethpeor
now
therefore
hearken
o
israel
unto
the
statutes
and
unto
the
judgments
which
i
teach
you
for
to
do
them
that
ye
may
live
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
giveth
you
ye
shall
not
add
unto
the
word
which
i
command
you
neither
shall
ye
diminish
ought
from
it
that
ye
may
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
your
eyes
have
seen
what
the
lord
did
because
of
baalpeor
for
all
the
men
that
followed
baalpeor
the
lord
thy
god
hath
destroyed
them
from
among
you
but
ye
that
did
cleave
unto
the
lord
your
god
are
alive
every
one
of
you
this
day
behold
i
have
taught
you
statutes
and
judgments
even
as
the
lord
my
god
commanded
me
that
ye
should
do
so
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
keep
therefore
and
do
them
for
this
is
your
wisdom
and
your
understanding
in
the
sight
of
the
nations
which
shall
hear
all
these
statutes
and
say
surely
this
great
nation
is
a
wise
and
understanding
people
for
what
nation
is
there
so
great
who
hath
god
so
nigh
unto
them
as
the
lord
our
god
is
in
all
things
that
we
call
upon
him
for
and
what
nation
is
there
so
great
that
hath
statutes
and
judgments
so
righteous
as
all
this
law
which
i
set
before
you
this
day
only
take
heed
to
thyself
and
keep
thy
soul
diligently
lest
thou
forget
the
things
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
and
lest
they
depart
from
thy
heart
all
the
days
of
thy
life
but
teach
them
thy
sons
and
thy
sons
sons
specially
the
day
that
thou
stoodest
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
horeb
when
the
lord
said
unto
me
gather
me
the
people
together
and
i
will
make
them
hear
my
words
that
they
may
learn
to
fear
me
all
the
days
that
they
shall
live
upon
the
earth
and
that
they
may
teach
their
children
and
ye
came
near
and
stood
under
the
mountain
and
the
mountain
burned
with
fire
unto
the
midst
of
heaven
with
darkness
clouds
and
thick
darkness
and
the
lord
spake
unto
you
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
ye
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
but
saw
no
similitude
only
ye
heard
a
voice
and
he
declared
unto
you
his
covenant
which
he
commanded
you
to
perform
even
ten
commandments
and
he
wrote
them
upon
two
tables
of
stone
and
the
lord
commanded
me
at
that
time
to
teach
you
statutes
and
judgments
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
to
possess
it
take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
yourselves
for
ye
saw
no
manner
of
similitude
on
the
day
that
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
lest
ye
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
you
a
graven
image
the
similitude
of
any
figure
the
likeness
of
male
or
female
the
likeness
of
any
beast
that
is
on
the
earth
the
likeness
of
any
winged
fowl
that
flieth
in
the
air
the
likeness
of
any
thing
that
creepeth
on
the
ground
the
likeness
of
any
fish
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
and
lest
thou
lift
up
thine
eyes
unto
heaven
and
when
thou
seest
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
even
all
the
host
of
heaven
shouldest
be
driven
to
worship
them
and
serve
them
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
divided
unto
all
nations
under
the
whole
heaven
but
the
lord
hath
taken
you
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
iron
furnace
even
out
of
egypt
to
be
unto
him
a
people
of
inheritance
as
ye
are
this
day
furthermore
the
lord
was
angry
with
me
for
your
sakes
and
sware
that
i
should
not
go
over
jordan
and
that
i
should
not
go
in
unto
that
good
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
but
i
must
die
in
this
land
i
must
not
go
over
jordan
but
ye
shall
go
over
and
possess
that
good
land
take
heed
unto
yourselves
lest
ye
forget
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
which
he
made
with
you
and
make
you
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
any
thing
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
forbidden
thee
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
consuming
fire
even
a
jealous
god
when
thou
shalt
beget
children
and
children's
children
and
ye
shall
have
remained
long
in
the
land
and
shall
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
a
graven
image
or
the
likeness
of
any
thing
and
shall
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
provoke
him
to
anger
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
soon
utterly
perish
from
off
the
land
whereunto
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
it
but
shall
utterly
be
destroyed
and
the
lord
shall
scatter
you
among
the
nations
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
among
the
heathen
whither
the
lord
shall
lead
you
and
there
ye
shall
serve
gods
the
work
of
men's
hands
wood
and
stone
which
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
eat
nor
smell
but
if
from
thence
thou
shalt
seek
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
find
him
if
thou
seek
him
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
when
thou
art
in
tribulation
and
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee
even
in
the
latter
days
if
thou
turn
to
the
lord
thy
god
and
shalt
be
obedient
unto
his
voice
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
merciful
god
he
will
not
forsake
thee
neither
destroy
thee
nor
forget
the
covenant
of
thy
fathers
which
he
sware
unto
them
for
ask
now
of
the
days
that
are
past
which
were
before
thee
since
the
day
that
god
created
man
upon
the
earth
and
ask
from
the
one
side
of
heaven
unto
the
other
whether
there
hath
been
any
such
thing
as
this
great
thing
is
or
hath
been
heard
like
it
did
ever
people
hear
the
voice
of
god
speaking
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
as
thou
hast
heard
and
live
or
hath
god
assayed
to
go
and
take
him
a
nation
from
the
midst
of
another
nation
by
temptations
by
signs
and
by
wonders
and
by
war
and
by
a
mighty
hand
and
by
a
stretched
out
arm
and
by
great
terrors
according
to
all
that
the
lord
your
god
did
for
you
in
egypt
before
your
eyes
unto
thee
it
was
shewed
that
thou
mightest
know
that
the
lord
he
is
god
there
is
none
else
beside
him
out
of
heaven
he
made
thee
to
hear
his
voice
that
he
might
instruct
thee
and
upon
earth
he
shewed
thee
his
great
fire
and
thou
heardest
his
words
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
because
he
loved
thy
fathers
therefore
he
chose
their
seed
after
them
and
brought
thee
out
in
his
sight
with
his
mighty
power
out
of
egypt
to
drive
out
nations
from
before
thee
greater
and
mightier
than
thou
art
to
bring
thee
in
to
give
thee
their
land
for
an
inheritance
as
it
is
this
day
know
therefore
this
day
and
consider
it
in
thine
heart
that
the
lord
he
is
god
in
heaven
above
and
upon
the
earth
beneath
there
is
none
else
thou
shalt
keep
therefore
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days
upon
the
earth
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
ever
then
moses
severed
three
cities
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
that
the
slayer
might
flee
thither
which
should
kill
his
neighbour
unawares
and
hated
him
not
in
times
past
and
that
fleeing
unto
one
of
these
cities
he
might
live
namely
bezer
in
the
wilderness
in
the
plain
country
of
the
reubenites
and
ramoth
in
gilead
of
the
gadites
and
golan
in
bashan
of
the
manassites
and
this
is
the
law
which
moses
set
before
the
children
of
israel
these
are
the
testimonies
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
after
they
came
forth
out
of
egypt
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
valley
over
against
bethpeor
in
the
land
of
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
who
dwelt
at
heshbon
whom
moses
and
the
children
of
israel
smote
after
they
were
come
forth
out
of
egypt
and
they
possessed
his
land
and
the
land
of
og
king
of
bashan
two
kings
of
the
amorites
which
were
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
bank
of
the
river
arnon
even
unto
mount
sion
which
is
hermon
and
all
the
plain
on
this
side
jordan
eastward
even
unto
the
sea
of
the
plain
under
the
springs
of
pisgah
and
moses
called
all
israel
and
said
unto
them
hear
o
israel
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
i
speak
in
your
ears
this
day
that
ye
may
learn
them
and
keep
and
do
them
the
lord
our
god
made
a
covenant
with
us
in
horeb
the
lord
made
not
this
covenant
with
our
fathers
but
with
us
even
us
who
are
all
of
us
here
alive
this
day
the
lord
talked
with
you
face
to
face
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
i
stood
between
the
lord
and
you
at
that
time
to
shew
you
the
word
of
the
lord
for
ye
were
afraid
by
reason
of
the
fire
and
went
not
up
into
the
mount
saying
i
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
thou
shalt
have
none
other
gods
before
me
thou
shalt
not
make
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above
or
that
is
in
the
earth
beneath
or
that
is
in
the
waters
beneath
the
earth
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
unto
them
nor
serve
them
for
i
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
and
shewing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain
keep
the
sabbath
day
to
sanctify
it
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
six
days
thou
shalt
labour
and
do
all
thy
work
but
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
it
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
nor
thy
manservant
nor
thy
maidservant
nor
thine
ox
nor
thine
ass
nor
any
of
thy
cattle
nor
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
that
thy
manservant
and
thy
maidservant
may
rest
as
well
as
thou
and
remember
that
thou
wast
a
servant
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
that
the
lord
thy
god
brought
thee
out
thence
through
a
mighty
hand
and
by
a
stretched
out
arm
therefore
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
thee
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
that
thy
days
may
be
prolonged
and
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
thou
shalt
not
kill
neither
shalt
thou
commit
adultery
neither
shalt
thou
steal
neither
shalt
thou
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbour
neither
shalt
thou
desire
thy
neighbour's
wife
neither
shalt
thou
covet
thy
neighbour's
house
his
field
or
his
manservant
or
his
maidservant
his
ox
or
his
ass
or
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbour's
these
words
the
lord
spake
unto
all
your
assembly
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
of
the
cloud
and
of
the
thick
darkness
with
a
great
voice
and
he
added
no
more
and
he
wrote
them
in
two
tables
of
stone
and
delivered
them
unto
me
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ye
heard
the
voice
out
of
the
midst
of
the
darkness
for
the
mountain
did
burn
with
fire
that
ye
came
near
unto
me
even
all
the
heads
of
your
tribes
and
your
elders
and
ye
said
behold
the
lord
our
god
hath
shewed
us
his
glory
and
his
greatness
and
we
have
heard
his
voice
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
we
have
seen
this
day
that
god
doth
talk
with
man
and
he
liveth
now
therefore
why
should
we
die
for
this
great
fire
will
consume
us
if
we
hear
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
any
more
then
we
shall
die
for
who
is
there
of
all
flesh
that
hath
heard
the
voice
of
the
living
god
speaking
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
as
we
have
and
lived
go
thou
near
and
hear
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
say
and
speak
thou
unto
us
all
that
the
lord
our
god
shall
speak
unto
thee
and
we
will
hear
it
and
do
it
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
your
words
when
ye
spake
unto
me
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
i
have
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
of
this
people
which
they
have
spoken
unto
thee
they
have
well
said
all
that
they
have
spoken
o
that
there
were
such
an
heart
in
them
that
they
would
fear
me
and
keep
all
my
commandments
always
that
it
might
be
well
with
them
and
with
their
children
for

go
say
to
them

you
into
your
tents
again
but
as
for
thee
stand
thou
here
by
me
and
i
will
speak
unto
thee
all
the
commandments
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
thou
shalt
teach
them
that
they
may
do
them
in
the
land
which
i
give
them
to
possess
it
ye
shall
observe
to
do
therefore
as
the
lord
your
god
hath
commanded
you
ye
shall
not
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
ye
shall
walk
in
all
the
ways
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
commanded
you
that
ye
may
live
and
that

may
be
well
with
you
and

may
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
which
ye
shall
possess
now
these
are
the
commandments
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
your
god
commanded
to
teach
you
that
ye
might
do
them
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
that
thou
mightest
fear
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
all
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee

and
thy
son
and

son's
son

the
days
of
thy
life
and

days
may
be
prolonged

therefore
o
israel
and

to
do
it
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
ye
may
increase
mightily
as
the
lord
god
of
thy
fathers
hath
promised
thee
in
the
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
hear
o
israel
the
lord
our
god
is
one
lord
and
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
might
and
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
be
in
thine
heart
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
and
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
and
thou
shalt
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
thine
hand
and
they
shall
be
as
frontlets
between
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
posts
of
thy
house
and
on
thy
gates
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
have
brought
thee
into
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
to
give
thee
great
and
goodly
cities
which
thou
buildedst
not
and
houses
full
of
all
good
things
which
thou
filledst
not
and
wells
digged
which
thou
diggedst
not
vineyards
and
olive
trees
which
thou
plantedst
not
when
thou
shalt
have
eaten
and
be
full
then
beware
lest
thou
forget
the
lord
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
thou
shalt
fear
the
lord
thy
god
and
serve
him
and
shalt
swear
by
his
name
ye
shall
not
go
after
other
gods
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
among
you
lest
the
anger
of
the
lord
thy
god
be
kindled
against
thee
and
destroy
thee
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
ye
shall
not
tempt
the
lord
your
god
as
ye
tempted
him
in
massah
ye
shall
diligently
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
which
he
hath
commanded
thee
and
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
and
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
go
in
and
possess
the
good
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
cast
out
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee
as
the
lord
hath
spoken
and
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
the
testimonies
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
the
lord
our
god
hath
commanded
you
then
thou
shalt
say
unto
thy
son
we
were
pharaoh's
bondmen
in
egypt
and
the
lord
brought
us
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
the
lord
shewed
signs
and
wonders
great
and
sore
upon
egypt
upon
pharaoh
and
upon
all
his
household
before
our
eyes
and
he
brought
us
out
from
thence
that
he
might
bring
us
in
to
give
us
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
our
fathers
and
the
lord
commanded
us
to
do
all
these
statutes
to
fear
the
lord
our
god
for
our
good
always
that
he
might
preserve
us
alive
as
it
is
at
this
day
and
it
shall
be
our
righteousness
if
we
observe
to
do
all
these
commandments
before
the
lord
our
god
as
he
hath
commanded
us
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bring
thee
into
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
and
hath
cast
out
many
nations
before
thee
the
hittites
and
the
girgashites
and
the
amorites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
seven
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thou
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
before
thee
thou
shalt
smite
them
and
utterly
destroy
them
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them
nor
shew
mercy
unto
them
neither
shalt
thou
make
marriages
with
them
thy
daughter
thou
shalt
not
give
unto
his
son
nor
his
daughter
shalt
thou
take
unto
thy
son
for
they
will
turn
away
thy
son
from
following
me
that
they
may
serve
other
gods
so
will
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
kindled
against
you
and
destroy
thee
suddenly
but
thus
shall
ye
deal
with
them
ye
shall
destroy
their
altars
and
break
down
their
images
and
cut
down
their
groves
and
burn
their
graven
images
with
fire
for
thou
art
an
holy
people
unto
the
lord
thy
god
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
thee
to
be
a
special
people
unto
himself
above
all
people
that
are
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
the
lord
did
not
set
his
love
upon
you
nor
choose
you
because
ye
were
more
in
number
than
any
people
for
ye
were
the
fewest
of
all
people
but
because
the
lord
loved
you
and
because
he
would
keep
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
unto
your
fathers
hath
the
lord
brought
you
out
with
a
mighty
hand
and
redeemed
you
out
of
the
house
of
bondmen
from
the
hand
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
know
therefore
that
the
lord
thy
god
he
is
god
the
faithful
god
which
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
with
them
that
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
to
a
thousand
generations
and
repayeth
them
that
hate
him
to
their
face
to
destroy
them
he
will
not
be
slack
to
him
that
hateth
him
he
will
repay
him
to
his
face
thou
shalt
therefore
keep
the
commandments
and
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
do
them
wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
hearken
to
these
judgments
and
keep
and
do
them
that
the
lord
thy
god
shall
keep
unto
thee
the
covenant
and
the
mercy
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
and
he
will
love
thee
and
bless
thee
and
multiply
thee
he
will
also
bless
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land
thy
corn
and
thy
wine
and
thine
oil
the
increase
of
thy
kine
and
the
flocks
of
thy
sheep
in
the
land
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
give
thee
thou
shalt
be
blessed
above
all
people
there
shall
not
be
male
or
female
barren
among
you
or
among
your
cattle
and
the
lord
will
take
away
from
thee
all
sickness
and
will
put
none
of
the
evil
diseases
of
egypt
which
thou
knowest
upon
thee
but
will
lay
them
upon
all
them
that
hate
thee
and
thou
shalt
consume
all
the
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
thee
thine
eye
shall
have
no
pity
upon
them
neither
shalt
thou
serve
their
gods
for
that
will
be
a
snare
unto
thee
if
thou
shalt
say
in
thine
heart
these
nations
are
more
than
i
how
can
i
dispossess
them
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
them
but
shalt
well
remember
what
the
lord
thy
god
did
unto
pharaoh
and
unto
all
egypt
the
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
saw
and
the
signs
and
the
wonders
and
the
mighty
hand
and
the
stretched
out
arm
whereby
the
lord
thy
god
brought
thee
out
so
shall
the
lord
thy
god
do
unto
all
the
people
of
whom
thou
art
afraid
moreover
the
lord
thy
god
will
send
the
hornet
among
them
until
they
that
are
left
and
hide
themselves
from
thee
be
destroyed
thou
shalt
not
be
affrighted
at
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
among
you
a
mighty
god
and
terrible
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
out
those
nations
before
thee
by
little
and
little
thou
mayest
not
consume
them
at
once
lest
the
beasts
of
the
field
increase
upon
thee
but
the
lord
thy
god
shall
deliver
them
unto
thee
and
shall
destroy
them
with
a
mighty
destruction
until
they
be
destroyed
and
he
shall
deliver
their
kings
into
thine
hand
and
thou
shalt
destroy
their
name
from
under
heaven
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
until
thou
have
destroyed
them
the
graven
images
of
their
gods
shall
ye
burn
with
fire
thou
shalt
not
desire
the
silver
or
gold
that
is
on
them
nor
take
it
unto
thee
lest
thou
be
snared
therin
for
it
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
thy
god
neither
shalt
thou
bring
an
abomination
into
thine
house
lest
thou
be
a
cursed
thing
like
it
but
thou
shalt
utterly
detest
it
and
thou
shalt
utterly
abhor
it
for
it
is
a
cursed
thing
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
ye
observe
to
do
that
ye
may
live
and
multiply
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
and
thou
shalt
remember
all
the
way
which
the
lord
thy
god
led
thee
these
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
to
humble
thee
and
to
prove
thee
to
know
what
was
in
thine
heart
whether
thou
wouldest
keep
his
commandments
or
no
and
he
humbled
thee
and
suffered
thee
to
hunger
and
fed
thee
with
manna
which
thou
knewest
not
neither
did
thy
fathers
know
that
he
might
make
thee
know
that
man
doth
not
live
by
bread
only
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lord
doth
man
live
thy
raiment
waxed
not
old
upon
thee
neither
did
thy
foot
swell
these
forty
years
thou
shalt
also
consider
in
thine
heart
that
as
a
man
chasteneth
his
son
so
the
lord
thy
god
chasteneth
thee
therefore
thou
shalt
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
and
to
fear
him
for
the
lord
thy
god
bringeth
thee
into
a
good
land
a
land
of
brooks
of
water
of
fountains
and
depths
that
spring
out
of
valleys
and
hills
a
land
of
wheat
and
barley
and
vines
and
fig
trees
and
pomegranates
a
land
of
oil
olive
and
honey
a
land
wherein
thou
shalt
eat
bread
without
scarceness
thou
shalt
not
lack
any
thing
in
it
a
land
whose
stones
are
iron
and
out
of
whose
hills
thou
mayest
dig
brass
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full
then
thou
shalt
bless
the
lord
thy
god
for
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
thee
beware
that
thou
forget
not
the
lord
thy
god
in
not
keeping
his
commandments
and
his
judgments
and
his
statutes
which
i
command
thee
this
day
lest
when
thou
hast
eaten
and
art
full
and
hast
built
goodly
houses
and
dwelt
therein
and
when
thy
herds
and
thy
flocks
multiply
and
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
multiplied
and
all
that
thou
hast
is
multiplied
then
thine
heart
be
lifted
up
and
thou
forget
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
who
led
thee
through
that
great
and
terrible
wilderness
wherein
were
fiery
serpents
and
scorpions
and
drought
where
there
was
no
water
who
brought
thee
forth
water
out
of
the
rock
of
flint
who
fed
thee
in
the
wilderness
with
manna
which
thy
fathers
knew
not
that
he
might
humble
thee
and
that
he
might
prove
thee
to
do
thee
good
at
thy
latter
end
and
thou
say
in
thine
heart
my
power
and
the
might
of
mine
hand
hath
gotten
me
this
wealth
but
thou
shalt
remember
the
lord
thy
god
for
it
is
he
that
giveth
thee
power
to
get
wealth
that
he
may
establish
his
covenant
which
he
sware
unto
thy
fathers
as
it
is
this
day
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
thy
god
and
walk
after
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
worship
them
i
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
as
the
nations
which
the
lord
destroyeth
before
your
face
so
shall
ye
perish
because
ye
would
not
be
obedient
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
your
god
hear
o
israel
thou
art
to
pass
over
jordan
this
day
to
go
in
to
possess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
thyself
cities
great
and
fenced
up
to
heaven
a
people
great
and
tall
the
children
of
the
anakims
whom
thou
knowest
and
of
whom
thou
hast
heard
say
who
can
stand
before
the
children
of
anak
understand
therefore
this
day
that
the
lord
thy
god
is
he
which
goeth
over
before
thee
as
a
consuming
fire
he
shall
destroy
them
and
he
shall
bring
them
down
before
thy
face
so
shalt
thou
drive
them
out
and
destroy
them
quickly
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thee
speak
not
thou
in
thine
heart
after
that
the
lord
thy
god
hath
cast
them
out
from
before
thee
saying
for
my
righteousness
the
lord
hath
brought
me
in
to
possess
this
land
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
not
for
thy
righteousness
or
for
the
uprightness
of
thine
heart
dost
thou
go
to
possess
their
land
but
for
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
and
that
he
may
perform
the
word
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
understand
therefore
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
not
this
good
land
to
possess
it
for
thy
righteousness
for
thou
art
a
stiffnecked
people
remember
and
forget
not
how
thou
provokedst
the
lord
thy
god
to
wrath
in
the
wilderness
from
the
day
that
thou
didst
depart
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
until
ye
came
unto
this
place
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
also
in
horeb
ye
provoked
the
lord
to
wrath
so
that
the
lord
was
angry
with
you
to
have
destroyed
you
when
i
was
gone
up
into
the
mount
to
receive
the
tables
of
stone
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
which
the
lord
made
with
you
then
i
abode
in
the
mount
forty
days
and
forty
nights
i
neither
did
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
and
the
lord
delivered
unto
me
two
tables
of
stone
written
with
the
finger
of
god
and
on
them
was
written
according
to
all
the
words
which
the
lord
spake
with
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
forty
days
and
forty
nights
that
the
lord
gave
me
the
two
tables
of
stone
even
the
tables
of
the
covenant
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
get
thee
down
quickly
from
hence
for
thy
people
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
have
corrupted
themselves
they
are
quickly
turned
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
commanded
them
they
have
made
them
a
molten
image
furthermore
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
i
have
seen
this
people
and
behold
it
is
a
stiffnecked
people
let
me
alone
that
i
may
destroy
them
and
blot
out
their
name
from
under
heaven
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
nation
mightier
and
greater
than
they
so
i
turned
and
came
down
from
the
mount
and
the
mount
burned
with
fire
and
the
two
tables
of
the
covenant
were
in
my
two
hands
and
i
looked
and
behold
ye
had
sinned
against
the
lord
your
god
and
had
made
you
a
molten
calf
ye
had
turned
aside
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
the
lord
had
commanded
you
and
i
took
the
two
tables
and
cast
them
out
of
my
two
hands
and
brake
them
before
your
eyes
and
i
fell
down
before
the
lord
as
at
the
first
forty
days
and
forty
nights
i
did
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
because
of
all
your
sins
which
ye
sinned
in
doing
wickedly
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
for
i
was
afraid
of
the
anger
and
hot
displeasure
wherewith
the
lord
was
wroth
against
you
to
destroy
you
but
the
lord
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also
and
the
lord
was
very
angry
with
aaron
to
have
destroyed
him
and
i
prayed
for
aaron
also
the
same
time
and
i
took
your
sin
the
calf
which
ye
had
made
and
burnt
it
with
fire
and
stamped
it
and
ground
it
very
small
even
until
it
was
as
small
as
dust
and
i
cast
the
dust
thereof
into
the
brook
that
descended
out
of
the
mount
and
at
taberah
and
at
massah
and
at
kibrothhattaavah
ye
provoked
the
lord
to
wrath
likewise
when
the
lord
sent
you
from
kadeshbarnea
saying
go
up
and
possess
the
land
which
i
have
given
you
then
ye
rebelled
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
your
god
and
ye
believed
him
not
nor
hearkened
to
his
voice
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
from
the
day
that
i
knew
you
thus
i
fell
down
before
the
lord
forty
days
and
forty
nights
as
i
fell
down
at
the
first
because
the
lord
had
said
he
would
destroy
you
i
prayed
therefore
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
destroy
not
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
hast
redeemed
through
thy
greatness
which
thou
hast
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
remember
thy
servants
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
look
not
unto
the
stubbornness
of
this
people
nor
to
their
wickedness
nor
to
their
sin
lest
the
land
whence
thou
broughtest
us
out
say
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
them
into
the
land
which
he
promised
them
and
because
he
hated
them
he
hath
brought
them
out
to
slay
them
in
the
wilderness
yet
they
are
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
broughtest
out
by
thy
mighty
power
and
by
thy
stretched
out
arm
at
that
time
the
lord
said
unto
me
hew
thee
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
come
up
unto
me
into
the
mount
and
make
thee
an
ark
of
wood
and
i
will
write
on
the
tables
the
words
that
were
in
the
first
tables
which
thou
brakest
and
thou
shalt
put
them
in
the
ark
and
i
made
an
ark
of
shittim
wood
and
hewed
two
tables
of
stone
like
unto
the
first
and
went
up
into
the
mount
having
the
two
tables
in
mine
hand
and
he
wrote
on
the
tables
according
to
the
first
writing
the
ten
commandments
which
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
the
mount
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
and
the
lord
gave
them
unto
me
and
i
turned
myself
and
came
down
from
the
mount
and
put
the
tables
in
the
ark
which
i
had
made
and
there
they
be
as
the
lord
commanded
me
and
the
children
of
israel
took
their
journey
from
beeroth
of
the
children
of
jaakan
to
mosera
there
aaron
died
and
there
he
was
buried
and
eleazar
his
son
ministered
in
the
priest's
office
in
his
stead
from
thence
they
journeyed
unto
gudgodah
and
from
gudgodah
to
jotbath
a
land
of
rivers
of
waters
at
that
time
the
lord
separated
the
tribe
of
levi
to
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
to
stand
before
the
lord
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
his
name
unto
this
day
wherefore
levi
hath
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
his
brethren
the
lord
is
his
inheritance
according
as
the
lord
thy
god
promised
him
and
i
stayed
in
the
mount
according
to
the
first
time
forty
days
and
forty
nights
and
the
lord
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
also
and
the
lord
would
not
destroy
thee
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
take
thy
journey
before
the
people
that
they
may
go
in

not
seen
the
chastisement
of
the
lord
your
god
his
greatness
his
mighty
hand
and
his
stretched
out
arm
and
his
miracles
and
his
acts
which
he
did
in
the
midst
of
egypt
unto
pharaoh
the
king
of
egypt
and
unto
all
his
land
and
what
he
did
unto
the
army
of
egypt
unto
their
horses
and
to
their
chariots
how
he
made
the
water
of
the
red
sea
to
overflow
them
as
they
pursued
after
you
and
how
the
lord
hath
destroyed
them
unto
this
day
and
what
he
did
unto
you
in
the
wilderness
until
ye
came
into
this
place
and
what
he
did
unto
dathan
and
abiram
the
sons
of
eliab
the
son
of
reuben
how
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
them
up
and
their
households
and
their
tents
and
all
the
substance
that
was
in
their
possession
in
the
midst
of
all
israel
but
your
eyes
have
seen
all
the
great
acts
of
the
lord
which
he
did
therefore
shall
ye
keep
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
you
this
day
that
ye
may
be
strong
and
go
in
and
possess
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
and
that
ye
may
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
unto
them
and
to
their
seed
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
for
the
land
whither
thou
goest
in
to
possess
it
is
not
as
the
land
of
egypt
from
whence
ye
came
out
where
thou
sowedst
thy
seed
and
wateredst
it
with
thy
foot
as
a
garden
of
herbs
but
the
land
whither
ye
go
to
possess
it
is
a
land
of
hills
and
valleys
and
drinketh
water
of
the
rain
of
heaven
a
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
careth
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
thy
god
are
always
upon
it
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
even
unto
the
end
of
the
year
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
ye
shall
hearken
diligently
unto
my
commandments
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
love
the
lord
your
god
and
to
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
that
i
will
give
you
the
rain
of
your
land
in
his
due
season
the
first
rain
and
the
latter
rain
that
thou
mayest
gather
in
thy
corn
and
thy
wine
and
thine
oil
and
i
will
send
grass
in
thy
fields
for
thy
cattle
that
thou
mayest
eat
and
be
full
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived
and
ye
turn
aside
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
and
then
the
lord's
wrath
be
kindled
against
you
and
he
shut
up
the
heaven
that
there
be
no
rain
and
that
the
land
yield
not
her
fruit
and
lest
ye
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
the
lord
giveth
you
therefore
shall
ye
lay
up
these
my
words
in
your
heart
and
in
your
soul
and
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
your
hand
that
they
may
be
as
frontlets
between
your
eyes
and
ye
shall
teach
them
your
children
speaking
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
and
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
door
posts
of
thine
house
and
upon
thy
gates
that
your
days
may
be
multiplied
and
the
days
of
your
children
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
your
fathers
to
give
them
as
the
days
of
heaven
upon
the
earth
for
if
ye
shall
diligently
keep
all
these
commandments
which
i
command
you
to
do
them
to
love
the
lord
your
god
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
cleave
unto
him
then
will
the
lord
drive
out
all
these
nations
from
before
you
and
ye
shall
possess
greater
nations
and
mightier
than
yourselves
every
place
whereon
the
soles
of
your
feet
shall
tread
shall
be
yours
from
the
wilderness
and
lebanon
from
the
river
the
river
euphrates
even
unto
the
uttermost
sea
shall
your
coast
be
there
shall
no
man
be
able
to
stand
before
you
for
the
lord
your
god
shall
lay
the
fear
of
you
and
the
dread
of
you
upon
all
the
land
that
ye
shall
tread
upon
as
he
hath
said
unto
you

set
before
you
this
day
a
blessing
and
a
curse
a
blessing
if
ye
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
which
i
command
you
this
day
and
a
curse
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
but
turn
aside
out
of
the
way
which
i
command
you
this
day
to
go
after
other
gods
which
ye
have
not
known
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
brought
thee
in
unto
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
that
thou
shalt
put
the
blessing
upon
mount
gerizim
and
the

observe
to
do
in
the
land
which
the

of
thy
fathers
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
all
the
days
that
ye
live
upon
the
earth
ye
shall
utterly
destroy
all
the
places
wherein
the
nations
which
ye
shall
possess
served
their
gods
upon
the
high
mountains
and
upon
the
hills
and
under

and
destroy
the
names
of
them
out
of
that
place
ye

not
do
so
unto
the
lord
your

but
unto
the
place
which

all
the
tithe

lendeth
ought
unto
his
neighbour
shall
release
it
he
shall
not
exact
it
of
his
neighbour
or
of
his
brother
because
it
is
called
the
lord's
release
of
a
foreigner
thou
mayest
exact
it
again
but
that
which
is
thine
with
thy

thine
hand
shall
release
save
when
there
shall
be
no
poor
among

for

bless
thee
in

which
the

thy

giveth
thee
for

thy
god
blesseth
thee
as
he
promised
thee
and
thou
shalt
lend
unto
many
nations
but
thou
shalt
not
borrow
and
thou
shalt
reign
over
many
nations
but
they
shall
not
reign
over
thee
if
there
be
among
you
a
poor
man
of
one
of
thy
brethren
within
any
of
thy
gates
in
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
thou
shalt
not
harden
thine
heart
nor
shut
thine
hand
from
thy
poor
brother
but
thou
shalt
open
thine
hand
wide
unto
him
and
shalt
surely
lend
him
sufficient
for
his
need
in
that
which
he
wanteth
beware
that
there
be
not
a
thought
in
thy
wicked
heart
saying

seventh
year
the
year
of

is
at
hand
and
thine
eye
be
evil
against
thy
poor
brother
and
thou
givest
him
nought
and
he
cry
unto
the
lord
against
thee
and
it
be
sin
unto
thee
thou
shalt
surely
give
him
and
thine
heart
shall
not
be
grieved
when
thou
givest
unto
him
because
that
for
this
thing
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bless
thee
in
all
thy
works
and
in
all
that
thou
puttest
thine
hand
unto
for
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
land
therefore
i
command
thee
saying
thou
shalt
open
thine
hand
wide
unto
thy
brother
to
thy
poor
and
to
thy
needy
in
thy
land
and
if
thy
brother
an
hebrew
man
or
an
hebrew
woman
be
sold
unto
thee
and
serve
thee
six
years
then
in
the
seventh
year
thou
shalt
let
him
go
free
from
thee
and
when
thou
sendest
him
out
free
from
thee
thou
shalt
not
let
him
go
away
empty

furnish
him
liberally
out
of
thy

of
thy
floor
and

wherewith

blessed
thee
thou
shalt
give
unto
him
and
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
lord
thy
god
redeemed
thee
therefore
i
command
thee
this
thing
to
day
and
it
shall
be
if
he
say
unto
thee
i
will
not
go
away
from
thee
because
he
loveth
thee
and
thine
house
because
he
is
well
with
thee
then
thou
shalt
take
an
aul
and
thrust
it
through
his
ear
unto
the
door
and
he
shall
be
thy
servant
for
ever
and
also
unto
thy
maidservant
thou
shalt
do
likewise
it
shall
not
seem
hard
unto
thee
when
thou
sendest
him
away
free
from
thee
for
he
hath
been
worth
a
double
hired
servant
to
thee
in
serving
thee
six
years
and
the

thy
god

the
judgment
which
they
shall
tell
thee
thou
shalt
do
thou
shalt
not
decline
from
the
sentence
which
they
shall
shew
thee
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
and
the
man
that
will
do
presumptuously
and
will
not
hearken
unto
the
priest
that
standeth
to
minister
there
before
the
lord
thy
god
or
unto
the
judge
even
that
man
shall
die
and
thou
shalt
put
away
the
evil
from
israel
and
all
the
people
shall
hear
and
fear
and
do
no
more
presumptuously
when
thou
art
come
unto
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
and
shalt
possess
it
and
shalt
dwell
therein
and
shalt
say
i
will
set
a
king
over
me
like
as
all
the
nations
that
are
about
me
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
set
him
king
over
thee
whom
the
lord
thy
god
shall
choose
one
from
among
thy
brethren
shalt
thou
set
king
over
thee
thou
mayest
not
set
a
stranger
over
thee
which
is
not
thy
brother
but
he
shall
not
multiply
horses
to
himself
nor
cause
the
people
to
return
to
egypt
to
the
end
that
he
should
multiply
horses
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
said
unto
you
ye
shall
henceforth
return
no
more
that
way
neither
shall
he
multiply
wives
to
himself
that
his
heart
turn
not
away
neither
shall
he
greatly
multiply
to
himself
silver
and
gold
and
it
shall
be
when
he
sitteth
upon
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
that
he
shall
write
him
a
copy
of
this
law
in
a
book
out
of
that
which
is
before
the
priests
the
levites
and
it
shall
be
with
him
and
he
shall
read
therein
all
the
days
of
his
life
that
he
may
learn
to
fear
the
lord
his
god
to
keep
all
the
words
of
this
law
and
these
statutes
to
do
them
that
his
heart
be
not
lifted
up
above
his
brethren
and
that
he
turn
not
aside
from
the
commandment
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
to
the
end
that
he
may
prolong
his
days
in
his
kingdom
he
and
his
children
in
the
midst
of
israel
the
priests
the
levites
and
all
the
tribe
of
levi
shall
have
no
part
nor
inheritance
with
israel
they
shall
eat
the
offerings
of
the
lord
made
by
fire
and
his
inheritance
therefore
shall
they
have
no
inheritance
among
their
brethren
the
lord
is
their
inheritance
as
he
hath
said
unto
them
and
this
shall
be
the
priest's
due
from
the
people
from
them
that
offer
a
sacrifice
whether
it
be
ox
or
sheep
and
they
shall
give
unto
the
priest
the
shoulder
and
the
two
cheeks
and
the
maw
the
firstfruit
also
of
thy
corn
of
thy
wine
and
of
thine
oil
and
the
first
of
the
fleece
of
thy
sheep
shalt
thou
give
him
for
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
him
out
of
all
thy
tribes
to
stand
to
minister
in
the
name
of
the
lord
him
and
his
sons
for
ever
and
if
a
levite
come
from
any
of
thy
gates
out
of
all
israel
where
he
sojourned
and
come
with
all
the
desire
of
his
mind
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
shall
choose
then
he
shall
minister
in
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
as
all
his
brethren
the
levites
do
which
stand
there
before
the
lord
they
shall
have
like
portions
to
eat
beside
that
which
cometh
of
the
sale
of
his
patrimony
when
thou
art
come
into
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
thou
shalt
not
learn
to
do
after
the
abominations
of
those
nations
there
shall
not
be
found
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
or
that
useth
divination
or
an
observer
of
times
or
an
enchanter
or
a
witch
or
a
charmer
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirits
or
a
wizard
or
a
necromancer
for
all
that
do
these
things
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
because
of
these
abominations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
thou
shalt
be
perfect
with
the
lord
thy
god
for
these
nations
which
thou
shalt
possess
hearkened
unto
observers
of
times
and
unto
diviners
but
as
for
thee
the
lord
thy
god
hath
not
suffered
thee
so
to
do
the
lord
thy
god
will
raise
up
unto
thee
a
prophet
from
the
midst
of
thee
of
thy
brethren
like
unto
me
unto
him
ye
shall
hearken
according
to
all
that
thou
desiredst
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
horeb
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
saying
let
me
not
hear
again
the
voice
of
the
lord
my
god
neither
let
me
see
this
great
fire
any
more
that
i
die
not
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
they
have
well
spoken
that
which
they
have
spoken
i
will
raise
them
up
a
prophet
from
among
their
brethren
like
unto
thee
and
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth
and
he
shall
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
shall
command
him
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
will
not
hearken
unto
my
words
which
he
shall
speak
in
my
name
i
will
require
it
of
him
but
the
prophet
which
shall
presume
to
speak
a
word
in
my
name
which
i
have
not
commanded
him
to
speak
or
that
shall
speak
in
the
name
of
other
gods
even
that
prophet
shall
die
and
if
thou
say
in
thine
heart
how
shall
we
know
the
word
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
when
a
prophet
speaketh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
if
the
thing
follow
not
nor
come
to
pass
that
is
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
but
the
prophet
hath
spoken
it
presumptuously
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
of
him
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
cut
off
the
nations
whose
land
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
and
thou
succeedest
them
and
dwellest
in
their
cities
and
in
their
houses
thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee
in
the
midst
of
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
thou
shalt
prepare
thee
a
way
and
divide
the
coasts
of
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
inherit
into
three
parts
that
every
slayer
may
flee
thither
and
this
is
the
case
of
the
slayer
which
shall
flee
thither
that
he
may
live
whoso
killeth
his
neighbour
ignorantly
whom
he
hated
not
in
time
past
as
when
a
man
goeth
into
the
wood
with
his
neighbour
to
hew
wood
and
his
hand
fetcheth
a
stroke
with
the
axe
to
cut
down
the
tree
and
the
head
slippeth
from
the
helve
and
lighteth
upon
his
neighbour
that
he
die
he
shall
flee
unto
one
of
those
cities
and
live
lest
the
avenger
of
the
blood
pursue
the
slayer
while
his
heart
is
hot
and
overtake
him
because
the
way
is
long
and
slay
him
whereas
he
was
not
worthy
of
death
inasmuch
as
he
hated
him
not
in
time
past
wherefore
i
command
thee
saying
thou
shalt
separate
three
cities
for
thee
and
if
the
lord
thy
god
enlarge
thy
coast
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers
and
give
thee
all
the
land
which
he
promised
to
give
unto
thy
fathers
if
thou
shalt
keep
all
these
commandments
to
do
them
which
i
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
to
walk
ever
in
his
ways
then
shalt
thou
add
three
cities
more
for
thee
beside
these
three
that
innocent
blood
be
not
shed
in
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
and
so
blood
be
upon
thee
but
if
any
man
hate
his
neighbour
and
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
rise
up
against
him
and
smite
him
mortally
that
he
die
and
fleeth
into
one
of
these
cities
then
the
elders
of
his
city
shall
send
and
fetch
him
thence
and
deliver
him
into
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood
that
he
may
die
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
him
but
thou
shalt
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
israel
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
thou
shalt
not
remove
thy
neighbour's
landmark
which
they
of
old
time
have
set
in
thine
inheritance
which
thou
shalt
inherit
in
the
land
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
one
witness
shall
not
rise
up
against
a
man
for
any
iniquity
or
for
any
sin
in
any
sin
that
he
sinneth
at
the
mouth
of
two
witnesses
or
at
the
mouth
of
three
witnesses
shall
the
matter
be
established
if
a
false
witness
rise
up
against
any
man
to
testify
against
him
that
which
is
wrong
then
both
the
men
between
whom
the
controversy
is
shall
stand
before
the
lord
before
the
priests
and
the
judges
which
shall
be
in
those
days
and
the
judges
shall
make
diligent
inquisition
and
behold
if
the
witness
be
a
false
witness
and
hath
testified
falsely
against
his
brother
then
shall
ye
do
unto
him
as
he
had
thought
to
have
done
unto
his
brother
so
shalt
thou
put
the
evil
away
from
among
you
and
those
which
remain
shall
hear
and
fear
and
shall
henceforth
commit
no
more
any
such
evil
among
you
and
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
but
life
shall
go
for
life
eye
for
eye
tooth
for
tooth
hand
for
hand
foot
for
foot
when
thou
goest
out
to
battle
against
thine
enemies
and
seest
horses
and
chariots
and
a
people
more
than
thou
be
not
afraid
of
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
with
thee
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
it
shall
be
when
ye
are
come
nigh
unto
the
battle
that
the
priest
shall
approach
and
speak
unto
the
people
and
shall
say
unto
them
hear
o
israel
ye
approach
this
day
unto
battle
against
your
enemies
let
not
your
hearts
faint
fear
not
and
do
not
tremble
neither
be
ye
terrified
because
of
them
for
the
lord
your
god
is
he
that
goeth
with
you
to
fight
for
you
against
your
enemies
to
save
you
and
the
officers
shall
speak
unto
the
people
saying
what
man
is
there
that
hath
built
a
new
house
and
hath
not
dedicated
it
let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
dedicate
it
and
what
man
is
he
that
hath
planted
a
vineyard
and
hath
not
yet
eaten
of
it
let
him
also
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
eat
of
it
and
what
man
is
there
that
hath
betrothed
a
wife
and
hath
not
taken
her
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
he
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
take
her
and
the
officers
shall
speak
further
unto
the
people
and
they
shall
say
what
man
is
there
that
is
fearful
and
fainthearted
let
him
go
and
return
unto
his
house
lest
his
brethren's
heart
faint
as
well
as
his
heart
and
it
shall
be
when
the
officers
have
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
that
they
shall
make
captains
of
the
armies
to
lead
the
people
when
thou
comest
nigh
unto
a
city
to
fight
against
it
then
proclaim
peace
unto
it
and
it
shall
be
if
it
make
thee
answer
of
peace
and
open
unto
thee
then
it
shall
be
that
all
the
people
that
is
found
therein
shall
be
tributaries
unto
thee
and
they
shall
serve
thee
and
if
it
will
make
no
peace
with
thee
but
will
make
war
against
thee
then
thou
shalt
besiege
it
and
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
it
into
thine
hands
thou
shalt
smite
every
male
thereof
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
cattle
and
all
that
is
in
the
city
even
all
the
spoil
thereof
shalt
thou
take
unto
thyself
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
spoil
of
thine
enemies
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
thus
shalt
thou
do
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
very
far
off
from
thee
which
are
not
of
the
cities
of
these
nations
but
of
the
cities
of
these
people
which
the
lord
thy
god
doth
give
thee
for
an
inheritance
thou
shalt
save
alive
nothing
that
breatheth
but
thou
shalt
utterly
destroy
them
namely
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
as
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
that
they
teach
you
not
to
do
after
all
their
abominations
which
they
have
done
unto
their
gods
so
should
ye
sin
against
the
lord
your
god
when
thou
shalt
besiege
a
city
a
long
time
in
making
war
against
it
to
take
it
thou
shalt
not
destroy
the
trees
thereof
by
forcing
an
axe
against
them
for
thou
mayest
eat
of
them
and
thou
shalt
not
cut
them
down
for
the
tree
of
the
field
is
man's
life
to
employ
them
in
the
siege
only
the
trees
which
thou
knowest
that
they
be
not
trees
for
meat
thou
shalt
destroy
and
cut
them
down
and
thou
shalt
build
bulwarks
against
the
city
that
maketh
war
with
thee
until
it
be
subdued
if
one
be
found
slain
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
it
lying
in
the
field
and
it
be
not
known
who
hath
slain
him
then
thy
elders
and
thy
judges
shall
come
forth
and
they
shall
measure
unto
the
cities
which
are
round
about
him
that
is
slain
and
it
shall
be
that
the
city
which
is
next
unto
the
slain
man
even
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
an
heifer
which
hath
not
been
wrought
with
and
which
hath
not
drawn
in
the
yoke
and
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
bring
down
the
heifer
unto
a
rough
valley
which
is
neither
eared
nor
sown
and
shall
strike
off
the
heifer's
neck
there
in
the
valley
and
the
priests
the
sons
of
levi
shall
come
near
for
them
the
lord
thy
god
hath
chosen
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
by
their
word
shall
every
controversy
and
every
stroke
be
tried
and
all
the
elders
of
that
city
that
are
next
unto
the
slain
man
shall
wash
their
hands
over
the
heifer
that
is
beheaded
in
the
valley
and
they
shall
answer
and
say
our
hands
have
not
shed
this
blood
neither
have
our
eyes
seen
it
be
merciful
o
lord
unto
thy
people
israel
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
and
lay
not
innocent
blood
unto
thy
people
of
israel's
charge
and
the
blood
shall
be
forgiven
them
so
shalt
thou
put
away
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
among
you
when
thou
shalt
do
that
which
is
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
when
thou
goest
forth
to
war
against
thine
enemies
and
the
lord
thy
god
hath
delivered
them
into
thine
hands
and
thou
hast
taken
them
captive
and
seest
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman
and
hast
a
desire
unto
her
that
thou
wouldest
have
her
to
thy
wife
then
thou
shalt
bring
her
home
to
thine
house
and
she
shall
shave
her
head
and
pare
her
nails
and
she
shall
put
the
raiment
of
her
captivity
from
off
her
and
shall
remain
in
thine
house
and
bewail
her
father
and
her
mother
a
full
month
and
after
that
thou
shalt
go
in
unto
her
and
be
her
husband
and
she
shall
be
thy
wife
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
have
no
delight
in
her
then
thou
shalt
let
her
go
whither
she
will
but
thou
shalt
not
sell
her
at
all
for
money
thou
shalt
not
make
merchandise
of
her
because
thou
hast
humbled
her
if
a
man
have
two
wives
one
beloved
and
another
hated
and
they
have
born
him
children
both
the
beloved
and
the
hated
and
if
the
firstborn
son
be
hers
that
was
hated
then
it
shall
be
when
he
maketh
his
sons
to
inherit
that
which
he
hath
that
he
may
not
make
the
son
of
the
beloved
firstborn
before
the
son
of
the
hated
which
is
indeed
the
firstborn
but
he
shall
acknowledge
the
son
of
the
hated
for
the
firstborn
by
giving
him
a
double
portion
of
all
that
he
hath
for
he
is
the
beginning
of
his
strength
the
right
of
the

is
his
if

have
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
son
which
will
not
obey
the
voice

his
father
or
the
voice
of

and
that
when
they
have
chastened
him
will
not
hearken
unto

lay
hold
on
him
and
bring
him
out
unto

this
our
son
is
stubborn

rebellious
he
will
not
obey
our
voice
he
is
a
glutton
and
a
drunkard
and
all
the
men
of
his
city
shall
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you
and
all
israel
shall
hear
and
fear
and
if
a
man
have
committed
a
sin
worthy
of
death
and
he
be
to
be
put
to
death
and
thou
hang
him
on
a
tree
his
body
shall
not
remain
all
night
upon
the
tree
but
thou
shalt
in
any
wise
bury
him
that
day
for
he
that
is
hanged

accursed
of

that
thy

after
it
and
thou
shalt
restore
it
to
him
again
in
like
manner

thou
do
with

so
shalt
thou
do
with
his
raiment
and
with
all
lost
thing
of
thy
brother's
which
he
hath
lost
and
thou

that
which
pertaineth
unto
a

neither
shall
a

put
on
a

garment
for
all
that
do
so
are
abomination
unto

sitting
upon

or
upon

thou

but
thou
shalt
in
any

let
the
dam
go
and
take
the
young
to
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
prolong
thy
days
when
thou
buildest
a
new
house
then
thou
shalt
make
a
battlement
for
thy
roof
that
thou
bring
not
blood
upon
thine
house
if
any
man
fall
from
thence
thou

together
thou
shalt
make
thee
fringes
upon
the
four
quarters
of
thy
vesture
wherewith
thou
coverest
thyself
if
any
man
take
a
wife
and
go
in
unto
her
and
hate
her
and
give
occasions
of
speech
against

and
bring
up
an
evil
name
upon
her
and
say
i
took
this
woman
and
when
i
came
to
her
i
found
her
not
a
maid
then
shall
the
father
of
the
damsel
and
her
mother
take
and
bring
forth
the
tokens
of
the
damsel's
virginity
unto
the
elders
of
the
city
in
the
gate
and
the
damsel's
father
shall
say
unto
the
elders
i
gave
my
daughter
unto
this
man
to
wife
and
he
hateth
her
and
lo
he
hath
given
occasions
of
speech
against
her
saying
i
found
not
thy
daughter
a
maid
and
yet
these
are
the
tokens
of
my
daughter's
virginity
and
they
shall
spread
the
cloth
before
the
elders
of
the
city
and
the
elders
of
that
city
shall
take
that
man
and
chastise
him
and
they
shall
amerce
him
in
an
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
give
them
unto
the
father
of
the
damsel
because
he
hath
brought
up
an
evil
name
upon
a
virgin
of
israel
and
she
shall
be
his
wife
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days
but
if
this
thing
be
true
and
the
tokens
of
virginity
be
not
found
for
the
damsel
then
they
shall
bring
out
the
damsel
to
the
door
of
her
father's
house
and
the
men
of
her
city
shall
stone
her
with
stones
that
she
die
because
she
hath
wrought
folly
in
israel
to
play
the
whore
in
her
father's
house
so
shalt
thou
put
evil
away
from
among
you
if
a
man
be
found
lying
with
a
woman
married
to
an
husband
then
they
shall
both
of
them
die
both
the
man
that
lay
with
the
woman
and
the
woman
so
shalt
thou
put
away
evil
from
israel
if
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
be
betrothed
unto
an
husband
and
a
man
find
her
in
the
city
and
lie
with
her
then
ye
shall
bring
them
both
out
unto
the
gate
of
that
city
and
ye
shall
stone
them
with
stones
that
they
die
the
damsel
because
she
cried
not
being
in
the
city
and
the
man
because
he
hath
humbled
his
neighbour's
wife
so
thou
shalt
put
away
evil
from
among
you
but
if
a
man
find
a
betrothed
damsel
in
the
field
and
the
man
force
her
and
lie
with
her
then
the
man
only
that
lay
with
her
shall
die
but
unto
the
damsel
thou
shalt
do
nothing
there
is
in
the
damsel
no
sin
worthy
of
death
for
as
when
a
man
riseth
against
his
neighbour
and
slayeth
him
even
so
is
this
matter
for
he
found
her
in
the
field
and
the
betrothed
damsel
cried
and
there
was
none
to
save
her
if
a
man
find
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
which
is
not
betrothed
and
lay
hold
on
her
and
lie
with
her
and
they
be
found
then
the
man
that
lay
with
her
shall
give
unto
the
damsel's
father
fifty
shekels
of
silver
and
she
shall
be
his
wife
because
he
hath
humbled
her
he
may
not
put
her
away
all
his
days
a
man
shall
not
take
his
father's
wife
nor
discover
his
father's
skirt
he
that
is
wounded
in
the
stones
or
hath
his

cut
off

an

congregation
of
the
lord
even
to
their
tenth
generation
shall
they
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
for
ever
because
they
met
you
not
with
bread
and
with
water
in
the
way
when
ye
came
forth
out
of
egypt
and
because
they
hired
against
thee
balaam
the
son
of
beor
of
pethor
of
mesopotamia
to
curse
thee
nevertheless
the
lord
thy
god
would
not
hearken
unto
balaam
but
the
lord
thy
god
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing
unto
thee
because
the
lord
thy
god
loved
thee
thou
shalt
not
seek
their
peace
nor
their
prosperity
all
thy
days
for
ever
thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
edomite
for
he
is
thy
brother
thou
shalt
not
abhor
an
egyptian
because
thou
wast
a
stranger
in
his
land
the
children
that
are
begotten
of
them
shall
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
in
their
third
generation
when
the
host
goeth
forth
against
thine
enemies
then
keep
thee
from
every
wicked
thing
if
there
be
among
you
any
man
that
is
not
clean
by
reason
of
uncleanness
that
chanceth
him
by
night
then
shall
he
go
abroad
out
of
the
camp
he
shall
not
come
within
the
camp
but
it
shall
be
when
evening
cometh
on
he
shall
wash
himself
with
water
and
when
the
sun
is
down
he
shall
come
into
the
camp
again
thou
shalt
have
a
place
also
without
the
camp
whither
thou
shalt
go
forth
abroad
and
thou
shalt
have
a
paddle
upon
thy
weapon
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
wilt
ease
thyself
abroad
thou
shalt
dig
therewith
and
shalt
turn
back
and
cover
that
which
cometh
from
thee
for
the
lord
thy
god
walketh
in
the
midst
of
thy
camp
to
deliver
thee
and
to
give
up
thine
enemies
before
thee
therefore
shall
thy
camp
be
holy
that
he
see
no
unclean
thing
in
thee
and
turn
away
from
thee
thou
shalt
not
deliver
unto
his
master
the
servant
which
is
escaped
from
his
master
unto
thee
he
shall
dwell
with
thee
even
among
you
in
that
place
which
he
shall
choose
in
one
of
thy
gates
where
it
liketh
him
best
thou

him
there
shall
be
no
whore
of
the
daughters
of
israel
nor
a
sodomite
of
the
sons
of
israel
thou

the
hire
of

or
the
price
of
a
dog
into

that
the

may
bless
thee
in
all
that
thou
settest
thine

vow
a
vow
unto
the

thy

thou
shalt
not
slack
to
pay
it
for
the
lord
thy
god
will
surely
require
it
of
thee
and
it
would
be
sin
in
thee
but
if
thou
shalt
forbear
to
vow
it
shall
be
no
sin
in
thee
that
which
is
gone
out
of

vowed
unto

thou
hast
promised
with

not
put

when
thou
comest
into
the
standing
corn
of
thy

then
thou
mayest
pluck
the
ears
with
thine
hand
but
thou
shalt
not
move
a

unto
thy

the
man
to
whom
thou
dost
lend
shall
bring

abroad
unto
thee
and
if
the

thou
shalt
deliver
him
the

again
when
the
sun
goeth
down
that
he
may
sleep
in
his

raiment
and
bless
thee
and
it
shall
be
righteousness
unto
thee
before
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
oppress
an
hired
servant
that
is
poor
and
needy
whether
he
be
of
thy

or
of
thy
strangers
that
are
in
thy
land
within
thy
gates
at
his
day
thou
shalt
give
him
his
hire
neither
shall
the
sun
go
down
upon
it
for
he
is
poor
and
setteth
his
heart
upon
it
lest
he
cry
against
thee
unto
the
lord
and
it
be
sin
unto
thee
the
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers
every
man
shall
be
put
to

for
his

sin
thou
shalt
not
pervert
the
judgment
of
the
stranger
nor
of
the
fatherless
nor
take
a
widow's
raiment
to
pledge
but
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
egypt
and
the
lord
thy
god
redeemed
thee
thence
therefore
i
command
thee
to
do
this
thing
when
thou
cuttest
down
thine
harvest
in
thy
field
and
hast
forgot
a
sheaf
in
the
field
thou
shalt
not
go
again
to
fetch
it
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
that
the
lord
thy
god
may
bless
thee
in
all
the
work
of
thine
hands
when
thou
beatest
thine
olive
tree
thou
shalt
not
go
over
the
boughs
again
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
when
thou
gatherest
the
grapes
of
thy
vineyard
thou
shalt
not
glean
it
afterward
it
shall
be
for
the
stranger
for
the
fatherless
and
for
the
widow
and
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
wast
a
bondman
in
the
land
of
egypt
therefore
i
command
thee
to
do
this
thing
if
there
be
a
controversy
between
men
and
they
come
unto
judgment
that
the
judges
may
judge
them
then
they
shall
justify
the
righteous
and
condemn
the
wicked
and
it
shall
be
if
the
wicked
man
be
worthy
to
be
beaten
that
the
judge
shall
cause
him
to
lie
down
and
to
be
beaten
before
his
face
according
to
his
fault
by
a
certain
number
forty
stripes
he
may
give
him
and
not
exceed
lest
if
he
should
exceed
and
beat
him
above
these
with
many
stripes
then
thy
brother
should
seem
vile
unto
thee
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
when
he
treadeth
out
the
corn
if
brethren
dwell
together
and
one
of
them
die
and
have
no
child
the
wife
of
the
dead
shall
not
marry
without
unto
a
stranger
her
husband's
brother
shall
go
in
unto
her
and
take
her
to
him
to
wife
and
perform
the
duty
of
an
husband's
brother

that
smiteth

and

weight
a
perfect
and
just
measure
shalt
thou
have
that
thy
days
may
be
lengthened
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
all
that
do
such
things
and
all
that
do
unrighteously
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
thy
god
remember
what
amalek
did
unto
thee
by
the
way
when
ye
were
come
forth
out
of
egypt
how
he
met
thee
by
the
way
and
smote
the
hindmost
of
thee
even
all
that
were
feeble
behind
thee
when
thou
wast
faint
and
weary
and
he
feared
not
god
therefore
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
round
about
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
to
possess
it
that
thou
shalt
blot
out
the
remembrance
of
amalek
from
under
heaven
thou
shalt
not
forget
it
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
art
come
in
unto
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
inheritance
and
possessest
it
and
dwellest
therein
that
thou
shalt
take
of
the
first
of
all
the
fruit
of
the
earth
which
thou
shalt
bring
of
thy
land
that
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
and
shalt
put
it
in
a
basket
and
shalt
go
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
choose
to
place
his
name
there
and
thou
shalt
go
unto
the
priest
that
shall
be
in
those
days
and
say
unto
him
i
profess
this
day
unto
the
lord
thy
god
that
i
am
come
unto
the
country
which
the
lord
sware
unto
our
fathers
for
to
give
us
and
the
priest
shall
take
the
basket
out
of
thine
hand
and
set
it
down
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
thou
shalt
speak
and
say
before
the
lord
thy
god
a
syrian
ready
to
perish
was
my
father
and
he
went
down
into
egypt
and
sojourned
there
with
a
few
and
became
there
a
nation
great
mighty
and
populous
and
the
egyptians
evil
entreated
us
and
afflicted
us
and
laid
upon
us
hard
bondage
and
when
we
cried
unto
the
lord
god
of
our
fathers
the
lord
heard
our
voice
and
looked
on
our
affliction
and
our
labour
and
our
oppression
and
the
lord
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
great
terribleness
and
with
signs
and
with
wonders
and
he
hath
brought
us
into
this
place
and
hath
given
us
this
land
even
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
now
behold
i
have
brought
the
firstfruits
of
the
land
which
thou
o
lord
hast
given
me
and
thou
shalt
set
it
before
the
lord
thy
god
and
worship
before
the
lord
thy
god
and
thou
shalt
rejoice
in
every
good
thing
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
unto
thee
and
unto
thine
house
thou
and
the
levite
and
the
stranger
that
is
among
you
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
tithing
all
the
tithes
of
thine
increase
the
third
year
which
is
the
year
of

and

given
it
unto
the
levite
the
stranger
the
fatherless
and
the
widow
that
they
may
eat
within
thy
gates
and

filled
then

thy
god

be
healed
from
the
sole
of
thy
foot
unto
the
top
of
thy
head
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
and
thy
king
which
thou
shalt
set
over
thee
unto
a
nation
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known
and
there
shalt
thou
serve
other
gods
wood
and
stone
and
thou
shalt
become
an
astonishment
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
nations
whither
the
lord
shall
lead
thee
thou
shalt
carry
much
seed
out
into
the
field
and
shalt
gather
but
little
in
for
the
locust
shall
consume
it
thou
shalt
plant
vineyards
and
dress
them
but
shalt
neither
drink
of
the
wine
nor
gather
the
grapes
for
the
worms
shall
eat
them
thou
shalt
have
olive
trees
throughout
all
thy
coasts
but
thou
shalt
not
anoint
thyself
with
the
oil
for
thine
olive
shall
cast
his
fruit
thou
shalt
beget
sons
and
daughters
but
thou
shalt
not
enjoy
them
for
they
shall
go
into
captivity
all
thy
trees
and
fruit
of
thy
land
shall
the
locust
consume
the
stranger
that
is
within
thee
shall
get
up
above
thee
very
high
and
thou
shalt
come
down
very
low
he
shall
lend
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
not
lend
to
him
he
shall
be
the
head
and
thou
shalt
be
the
tail
moreover
all
these
curses
shall
come
upon
thee
and
shall
pursue
thee
and
overtake
thee
till
thou
be
destroyed
because
thou
hearkenedst
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
he
commanded
thee
and
they
shall
be
upon
thee
for
a
sign
and
for
a
wonder
and
upon
thy
seed
for
ever
because
thou
servedst
not
the
lord
thy
god
with
joyfulness
and
with
gladness
of
heart
for
the
abundance
of
all
things
therefore
shalt
thou
serve
thine
enemies
which
the
lord
shall
send
against
thee
in
hunger
and
in
thirst
and
in
nakedness
and
in
want
of
all
things
and
he
shall
put
a
yoke
of
iron
upon
thy
neck
until
he
have
destroyed
thee
the
lord
shall
bring
a
nation
against
thee
from
far
from
the
end
of
the
earth
as
swift
as
the
eagle
flieth
a
nation
whose
tongue
thou
shalt
not
understand
a
nation
of
fierce
countenance
which
shall
not
regard
the
person
of
the
old
nor
shew
favour
to
the
young
and
he
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle
and
the
fruit
of
thy
land
until
thou
be
destroyed
which
also
shall
not
leave
thee
either
corn
wine
or
oil
or
the
increase
of
thy
kine
or
flocks
of
thy
sheep
until
he
have
destroyed
thee
and
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates
until
thy
high
and
fenced
walls
come
down
wherein
thou
trustedst
throughout
all
thy
land
and
he
shall
besiege
thee
in
all
thy
gates
throughout
all
thy
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
fruit
of
thine
own
body
the
flesh
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
thee
in
the
siege
and
in
the
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee
so
that
the
man
that
is
tender
among
you
and
very
delicate
his
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
his
brother
and
toward
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
toward
the
remnant
of
his
children
which
he
shall
leave
so
that
he
will
not
give
to
any
of
them
of
the
flesh
of
his
children
whom
he
shall
eat
because
he
hath
nothing
left
him
in
the
siege
and
in
the
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemies
shall
distress
thee
in
all
thy
gates
the
tender
and
delicate
woman
among
you
which
would
not
adventure
to
set
the
sole
of
her
foot
upon
the
ground
for
delicateness
and
tenderness
her
eye
shall
be
evil
toward
the
husband
of
her
bosom
and
toward
her
son
and
toward
her
daughter
and
toward
her
young
one
that
cometh
out
from
between
her
feet
and
toward
her
children
which
she
shall
bear
for
she
shall
eat
them
for
want
of
all
things
secretly
in
the
siege
and
straitness
wherewith
thine
enemy
shall
distress
thee
in
thy
gates
if
thou
wilt
not
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
that
are
written
in
this
book
that
thou
mayest
fear
this
glorious
and
fearful
name
the
lord
thy
god
then
the
lord
will
make
thy
plagues
wonderful
and
the
plagues
of
thy
seed
even
great
plagues
and
of
long
continuance
and
sore
sicknesses
and
of
long
continuance
moreover
he
will
bring
upon
thee
all
the
diseases
of
egypt
which
thou
wast
afraid
of
and
they
shall
cleave
unto
thee
also
every
sickness
and
every
plague
which
is
not
written
in
the
book
of
this
law
them
will
the
lord
bring
upon
thee
until
thou
be
destroyed
and
ye
shall
be
left
few
in
number
whereas
ye
were
as
the
stars
of
heaven
for
multitude
because
thou
wouldest
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
as
the
lord
rejoiced
over
you
to
do
you
good
and
to
multiply
you
so
the
lord
will
rejoice
over
you
to
destroy
you
and
to
bring
you
to
nought
and
ye
shall
be
plucked
from
off
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
and
the
lord
shall
scatter
thee
among
all
people
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
and
there
thou
shalt
serve
other
gods
which
neither
thou
nor
thy
fathers
have
known
even
wood
and
stone
and
among
these
nations
shalt
thou
find
no
ease
neither
shall
the
sole
of
thy
foot
have
rest
but
the
lord
shall
give
thee
there
a
trembling
heart
and
failing
of
eyes
and
sorrow
of
mind
and
thy
life
shall
hang
in
doubt
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
fear
day
and
night
and
shalt
have
none
assurance
of
thy
life
in
the
morning
thou
shalt
say
would
god
it
were
even
and
at
even
thou
shalt
say
would
god
it
were
morning
for
the
fear
of
thine
heart
wherewith
thou
shalt
fear
and
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see
and
the
lord
shall
bring
thee
into
egypt
again
with
ships
by
the
way
whereof
i
spake
unto
thee
thou
shalt
see
it
no
more
again
and
there
ye
shall
be
sold
unto
your
enemies
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
and
no
man
shall
buy
you
these
are
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
the
lord
commanded
moses
to
make
with
the
children
of
israel
in
the
land
of
moab
beside
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
them
in
horeb
and
moses
called
unto
all
israel
and
said
unto
them
ye
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
did
before
your
eyes
in
the
land
of
egypt
unto
pharaoh
and
unto
all
his
servants
and
unto
all
his
land
the
great
temptations
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
the
signs
and
those
great
miracles
yet
the
lord
hath
not
given
you
an
heart
to
perceive
and
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
unto
this
day
and
i
have
led
you
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
your
clothes
are
not
waxen
old
upon
you
and
thy
shoe
is
not
waxen
old
upon
thy
foot
ye
have
not
eaten
bread
neither
have
ye
drunk
wine
or
strong
drink
that
ye
might
know
that
i
am
the
lord
your
god
and
when
ye
came
unto
this
place
sihon
the
king
of
heshbon
and
og
the
king
of
bashan
came
out
against
us
unto
battle
and
we
smote
them
and
we
took
their
land
and
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
the
reubenites
and
to
the
gadites
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
keep
therefore
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
do
them
that
ye
may
prosper
in
all
that
ye
do
ye
stand
this
day
all
of
you
before
the
lord
your
god
your
captains
of
your
tribes
your
elders
and
your
officers
with
all
the
men
of
israel
your
little
ones
your
wives
and
thy
stranger
that
is
in
thy
camp
from
the
hewer
of
thy
wood
unto
the
drawer
of
thy
water
that
thou
shouldest
enter
into
covenant
with
the
lord
thy
god
and
into
his
oath
which
the
lord
thy
god
maketh
with
thee
this
day
that
he
may
establish
thee
to
day
for
a
people
unto
himself
and
that
he
may
be
unto
thee
a
god
as
he
hath
said
unto
thee
and
as
he
hath
sworn
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
neither
with
you
only
do
i
make
this
covenant
and
this
oath
but
with
him
that
standeth
here
with
us
this
day
before
the
lord
our
god
and
also
with
him
that
is
not
here
with
us
this
day
for
ye
know
how
we
have
dwelt
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
how
we
came
through
the
nations
which
ye
passed
by
and
ye
have
seen
their
abominations
and
their
idols
wood
and
stone
silver
and
gold
which
were
among
them
lest
there
should
be
among
you
man
or
woman
or
family
or
tribe
whose
heart
turneth
away
this
day
from
the
lord
our
god
to
go
and
serve
the
gods
of
these
nations
lest
there
should
be
among
you
a
root
that
beareth
gall
and
wormwood
and
it
come
to
pass
when
he
heareth
the
words
of
this
curse
that
he
bless
himself
in
his
heart
saying
i
shall
have
peace
though
i
walk
in
the
imagination
of
mine
heart
to
add
drunkenness
to
thirst
the
lord
will
not
spare
him
but
then
the
anger
of
the
lord
and
his
jealousy
shall
smoke
against
that
man
and
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book
shall
lie
upon
him
and
the
lord
shall
blot
out
his
name
from
under
heaven
and
the
lord
shall
separate
him
unto
evil
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
according
to
all
the
curses
of
the
covenant
that
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law
so
that
the
generation
to
come
of
your
children
that
shall
rise
up
after
you
and
the
stranger
that
shall
come
from
a
far
land
shall
say
when
they
see
the
plagues
of
that
land
and
the
sicknesses
which
the
lord
hath
laid
upon
it
and
that
the
whole
land
thereof
is
brimstone
and
salt
and
burning
that
it
is
not
sown
nor
beareth
nor
any
grass
groweth
therein
like
the
overthrow
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
admah
and
zeboim
which
the
lord
overthrew
in
his
anger
and
in
his
wrath
even
all
nations
shall
say
wherefore
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
what
meaneth
the
heat
of
this
great
anger
then
men
shall
say
because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenant
of
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
went
and
served
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
gods
whom
they
knew
not
and
whom
he
had
not
given
unto
them
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
this
land
to
bring
upon
it
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
this
book
and
the
lord
rooted
them
out
of
their
land
in
anger
and
in
wrath
and
in
great
indignation
and
cast
them
into
another
land
as
it
is
this
day
the
secret
things
belong
unto
the
lord
our
god
but
those
things
which
are
revealed
belong
unto
us
and
to
our
children
for
ever
that
we
may
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
all
these
things
are
come
upon
thee
the
blessing
and
the
curse
which
i
have
set
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
call
them
to
mind
among
all
the
nations
whither
the
lord
thy
god
hath
driven
thee
and
shalt
return
unto
the
lord
thy
god
and
shalt
obey
his
voice
according
to
all
that
i
command
thee
this
day
thou
and
thy
children
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
that
then
the
lord
thy
god
will
turn
thy
captivity
and
have
compassion
upon
thee
and
will
return
and
gather
thee
from
all
the
nations
whither
the
lord
thy
god
hath
scattered
thee
if
any
of
thine
be
driven
out
unto
the
outmost
parts
of
heaven
from
thence
will
the
lord
thy
god
gather
thee
and
from
thence
will
he
fetch
thee
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
bring
thee
into
the
land
which
thy
fathers
possessed
and
thou
shalt
possess
it
and
he
will
do
thee
good
and
multiply
thee
above
thy
fathers
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
circumcise
thine
heart
and
the
heart
of
thy
seed
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
that
thou
mayest
live
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
put
all
these
curses
upon
thine
enemies
and
on
them
that
hate
thee
which
persecuted
thee
and
thou
shalt
return
and
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
do
all
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
and
the
lord
thy
god
will
make
thee
plenteous
in
every
work
of
thine
hand
in
the
fruit
of
thy
body
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
cattle
and
in
the
fruit
of
thy
land
for
good
for
the
lord
will
again
rejoice
over
thee
for
good
as
he
rejoiced
over
thy
fathers
if
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
which
are
written
in
this
book
of
the
law
and
if
thou
turn
unto
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thine
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
for
this
commandment
which
i
command
thee
this
day
it
is
not
hidden
from
thee
neither
is
it
far
off
it
is
not
in
heaven
that
thou
shouldest
say
who
shall
go
up
for
us
to
heaven
and
bring
it
unto
us
that
we
may
hear
it
and
do
it
neither
is
it
beyond
the
sea
that
thou
shouldest
say
who
shall
go
over
the
sea
for
us
and
bring
it
unto
us
that
we
may
hear
it
and
do
it
but
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
do
it
see
i
have
set
before
thee
this
day
life
and
good
and
death
and
evil
in
that
i
command
thee
this
day
to
love
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
that
thou
mayest
live
and
multiply
and
the
lord
thy
god
shall
bless
thee
in
the
land
whither
thou
goest
to
possess
it
but
if
thine
heart
turn
away
so
that
thou
wilt
not
hear
but
shalt
be
drawn
away
and
worship
other
gods
and
serve
them
i
denounce
unto
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
and
that
ye
shall
not
prolong
your
days
upon
the
land
whither
thou
passest
over
jordan
to
go
to
possess
it
i
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
this
day
against
you
that
i
have
set
before
you
life
and
death
blessing
and
cursing
therefore
choose
life
that
both
thou
and
thy
seed
may
live
that
thou
mayest
love
the
lord
thy
god
and
that
thou
mayest
obey
his
voice
and
that
thou
mayest
cleave
unto
him
for
he
is
thy
life
and
the
length
of
thy
days
that
thou
mayest
dwell
in
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
thy
fathers
to
abraham
to
isaac
and
to
jacob
to
give
them
and
moses
went
and
spake
these
words
unto
all
israel
and
he
said
unto
them
i
am
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
this
day
i
can
no
more
go
out
and
come
in
also
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
shalt
not
go
over
this
jordan
the
lord
thy
god
he
will
go
over
before
thee
and
he
will
destroy
these
nations
from
before
thee
and
thou
shalt
possess
them
and
joshua
he
shall
go
over
before
thee
as
the
lord
hath
said
and
the
lord
shall
do
unto
them
as
he
did
to
sihon
and
to
og
kings
of
the
amorites
and
unto
the
land
of
them
whom
he
destroyed
and
the
lord
shall
give
them
up
before
your
face
that
ye
may
do
unto
them
according
unto
all
the
commandments
which
i
have
commanded
you
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage

not
nor
be
afraid
of
them
for
the
lord
thy
god
he
it
is
that
doth
go
with
thee
he
will
not
fail
thee
nor
forsake
thee
and
moses
called
unto
joshua
and
said
unto
him
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
thou
must
go
with
this
people
unto
the
land
which
the
lord
hath
sworn
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them
and
thou
shalt
cause
them
to
inherit
it
and
the
lord
he
it
is
that
doth
go
before
thee
he
will
be
with
thee
he
will
not
fail
thee
neither
forsake
thee
fear
not
neither
be
dismayed
and
moses
wrote
this
law
and
delivered
it
unto
the
priests
the
sons
of
levi
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
unto
all
the
elders
of
israel
and
moses
commanded
them
saying
at
the
end
of
every
seven
years
in
the
solemnity
of
the
year
of
release
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles
when
all
israel
is
come
to
appear
before
the
lord
thy
god
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose
thou
shalt
read
this
law
before
all
israel
in
their
hearing
gather
the
people
together
men
and
women
and
children
and
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates
that
they
may
hear
and
that
they
may
learn
and
fear
the
lord
your
god
and
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
and
that
their
children
which
have
not
known
any
thing
may
hear
and
learn
to
fear
the
lord
your
god
as
long
as
ye
live
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
behold
thy
days
approach
that
thou
must
die
call
joshua
and
present
yourselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
that
i
may
give
him
a
charge
and
moses
and
joshua
went
and
presented
themselves
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
lord
appeared
in
the
tabernacle
in
a
pillar
of
a
cloud
and
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
stood
over
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
behold
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
and
this
people
will
rise
up
and
go
a
whoring
after
the
gods
of
the
strangers
of
the
land
whither
they
go
to
be
among
them
and
will
forsake
me
and
break
my
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
them
then
my
anger
shall
be
kindled
against
them
in
that
day
and
i
will
forsake
them
and
i
will
hide
my
face
from
them
and
they
shall
be
devoured
and
many
evils
and
troubles
shall
befall
them
so
that
they
will
say
in
that
day
are
not
these
evils
come
upon
us
because
our
god
is
not
among
us
and
i
will
surely
hide
my
face
in
that
day
for
all
the
evils
which
they
shall
have
wrought
in
that
they
are
turned
unto
other
gods
now
therefore
write
ye
this
song
for
you
and
teach
it
the
children
of
israel
put
it
in
their
mouths
that
this
song
may
be
a
witness
for
me
against
the
children
of
israel
for
when
i
shall
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
they
shall
have
eaten
and
filled
themselves
and
waxen
fat
then
will
they
turn
unto
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
provoke
me
and
break
my
covenant
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
many
evils
and
troubles
are
befallen
them
that
this
song
shall
testify
against
them
as
a
witness
for
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
out
of
the
mouths
of
their
seed
for
i
know
their
imagination
which
they
go
about
even
now
before
i
have
brought
them
into
the
land
which
i
sware
moses
therefore
wrote
this
song
the
same
day
and
taught
it
the
children
of
israel
and
he
gave
joshua
the
son
of
nun
a
charge
and
said
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
thou
shalt
bring
the
children
of
israel
into
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
them
and
i
will
be
with
thee
and
it
came
to
pass
when
moses
had
made
an
end
of
writing
the
words
of
this
law
in
a
book
until
they
were
finished
that
moses
commanded
the
levites
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
saying
take
this
book
of
the
law
and
put
it
in
the
side
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
that
it
may
be
there
for
a
witness
against
thee
for
i
know
thy
rebellion
and
thy
stiff
neck
behold
while
i
am
yet
alive
with
you
this
day
ye
have
been
rebellious
against
the
lord
and
how
much
more
after
my
death
gather
unto
me
all
the
elders
of
your
tribes
and
your
officers
that
i
may
speak
these
words
in
their
ears
and
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
against
them
for
i
know
that
after
my
death
ye
will
utterly
corrupt
yourselves
and
turn
aside
from
the
way
which
i
have
commanded
you
and
evil
will
befall
you
in
the
latter
days
because
ye
will
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
through
the
work
of
your
hands
and
moses
spake
in
the
ears
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
the
words
of
this
song
until
they
were
ended
give
ear
o
ye
heavens
and
i
will
speak
and
hear
o
earth
the
words
of
my
mouth
my
doctrine
shall
drop
as
the
rain
my
speech
shall
distil
as
the
dew
as
the
small
rain
upon
the
tender
herb
and
as
the
showers
upon
the
grass
because
i
will
publish
the
name
of
the
lord
ascribe
ye
greatness
unto
our
god
he
is
the
rock
his
work
is
perfect
for
all
his
ways
are
judgment
a
god
of
truth
and
without
iniquity
just
and
right
is
he
they
have
corrupted
themselves
their
spot
is
not
the
spot
of
his
children
they
are
a
perverse
and
crooked
generation
do
ye
thus
requite
the
lord
o
foolish
people
and
unwise
is
not
he
thy
father
that
hath
bought
thee
hath
he
not
made
thee
and
established
thee
remember
the
days
of
old
consider
the
years
of
many
generations
ask
thy
father
and
he
will
shew
thee
thy
elders
and
they
will
tell
thee
when
the
most
high
divided
to
the
nations
their
inheritance
when
he
separated
the
sons
of
adam
he
set
the
bounds
of
the
people
according
to
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
for
the
lord's
portion
is
his
people
jacob
is
the
lot
of
his
inheritance
he
found
him
in
a
desert
land
and
in
the
waste
howling
wilderness
he
led
him
about
he
instructed
him
he
kept
him
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
as
an
eagle
stirreth
up
her
nest
fluttereth
over
her
young
spreadeth
abroad
her
wings
taketh
them
beareth
them
on
her
wings
so
the
lord
alone
did
lead
him
and
there
was
no
strange
god
with
him
he
made
him
ride
on
the
high
places
of
the
earth
that
he
might
eat
the
increase
of
the
fields
and
he
made
him
to
suck
honey
out
of
the
rock
and
oil
out
of
the
flinty
rock
butter
of
kine
and
milk
of
sheep
with
fat
of
lambs
and
rams
of
the
breed
of
bashan
and
goats
with
the
fat
of
kidneys
of
wheat
and
thou
didst
drink
the
pure
blood
of
the
grape
but
jeshurun
waxed
fat
and
kicked
thou
art
waxen
fat
thou
art
grown
thick
thou
art
covered
with
fatness
then
he
forsook
god
which
made
him
and
lightly
esteemed
the
rock
of
his
salvation
they
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
strange
gods
with
abominations
provoked
they
him
to
anger
they
sacrificed
unto
devils
not
to
god
to
gods
whom
they
knew
not
to
new
gods
that
came
newly
up
whom
your
fathers
feared
not
of
the
rock
that
begat
thee
thou
art
unmindful
and
hast
forgotten
god
that
formed
thee
and
when
the
lord
saw
it
he
abhorred
them
because
of
the
provoking
of
his
sons
and
of
his
daughters
and
he
said
i
will
hide
my
face
from
them
i
will
see
what
their
end
shall
be
for
they
are
a
very
froward
generation
children
in
whom
is
no
faith
they
have
moved
me
to
jealousy
with
that
which
is
not
god
they
have
provoked
me
to
anger
with
their
vanities
and
i
will
move
them
to
jealousy
with
those
which
are
not
a
people
i
will
provoke
them
to
anger
with
a
foolish
nation
for
a
fire
is
kindled
in
mine
anger
and
shall
burn
unto
the
lowest
hell
and
shall
consume
the
earth
with
her
increase
and
set
on
fire
the
foundations
of
the
mountains
i
will
heap
mischiefs
upon
them
i
will
spend
mine
arrows
upon
them
they
shall
be
burnt
with
hunger
and
devoured
with
burning
heat
and
with
bitter
destruction
i
will
also
send
the
teeth
of
beasts
upon
them
with
the
poison
of
serpents
of
the
dust
the
sword
without
and
terror
within
shall
destroy
both
the
young
man
and
the
virgin
the
suckling
also
with
the
man
of
gray
hairs
i
said
i
would
scatter
them
into
corners
i
would
make
the
remembrance
of
them
to
cease
from
among
men
were
it
not
that
i
feared
the
wrath
of
the
enemy
lest
their
adversaries
should
behave
themselves
strangely
and
lest
they
should
say
our
hand
is
high
and
the
lord
hath
not
done
all
this
for
they
are
a
nation
void
of
counsel
neither
is
there
any
understanding
in
them
o
that
they
were
wise
that
they
understood
this
that
they
would
consider
their
latter
end
how
should
one
chase
a
thousand
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
except
their
rock
had
sold
them
and
the
lord
had
shut
them
up
for
their
rock
is
not
as
our
rock
even
our
enemies
themselves
being
judges
for
their
vine
is
of
the
vine
of
sodom
and
of
the
fields
of
gomorrah
their
grapes
are
grapes
of
gall
their
clusters
are
bitter
their
wine
is
the
poison
of
dragons
and
the
cruel
venom
of
asps
is
not
this
laid
up
in
store
with
me
and
sealed
up
among
my
treasures
to
me
belongeth
vengeance
and
recompence
their
foot
shall
slide
in
due
time
for
the
day
of
their
calamity
is
at
hand
and
the
things
that
shall
come
upon
them
make
haste
for
the
lord
shall
judge
his
people
and
repent
himself
for
his
servants
when
he
seeth
that
their
power
is
gone
and
there
is
none
shut
up
or
left
and
he
shall
say
where
are
their
gods
their
rock
in
whom
they
trusted
which
did
eat
the
fat
of
their
sacrifices
and
drank
the
wine
of
their
drink
offerings
let
them
rise
up
and
help
you
and
be
your
protection
see
now
that
i
even
i
am
he
and
there
is
no
god
with
me
i
kill
and
i
make
alive
i
wound
and
i
heal
neither
is
there
any
that
can
deliver
out
of
my
hand
for
i
lift
up
my
hand
to
heaven
and
say
i
live
for
ever
if
i
whet
my
glittering
sword
and
mine
hand
take
hold
on
judgment
i
will
render
vengeance
to
mine
enemies
and
will
reward
them
that
hate
me
i
will
make
mine
arrows
drunk
with
blood
and
my
sword
shall
devour
flesh
and
that
with
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
of
the
captives
from
the
beginning
of
revenges
upon
the
enemy
rejoice
o
ye
nations
with
his
people
for
he
will
avenge
the
blood
of
his
servants
and
will
render
vengeance
to
his
adversaries
and
will
be
merciful
unto
his
land
and
to
his
people
and
moses
came
and
spake
all
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
ears
of
the
people
he
and
hoshea
the
son
of
nun
and
moses
made
an
end
of
speaking
all
these
words
to
all
israel
and
he
said
unto
them
set
your
hearts
unto
all
the
words
which
i
testify
among
you
this
day
which
ye
shall
command
your
children
to
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
for
it
is
not
a
vain
thing
for
you
because
it
is
your
life
and
through
this
thing
ye
shall
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
whither
ye
go
over
jordan
to
possess
it
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
that
selfsame
day
saying
get
thee
up
into
this
mountain
abarim
unto
mount
nebo
which
is
in
the
land
of
moab
that
is
over
against
jericho
and
behold
the
land
of
canaan
which
i
give
unto
the
children
of
israel
for
a
possession
and
die
in
the
mount
whither
thou
goest
up
and
be
gathered
unto
thy
people
as
aaron
thy
brother
died
in
mount
hor
and
was
gathered
unto
his
people
because
ye
trespassed
against
me
among
the
children
of
israel
at
the
waters
of
meribahkadesh
in
the
wilderness
of
zin
because
ye
sanctified
me
not
in
the
midst
of
the
children
of
israel
yet
thou
shalt
see
the
land
before
thee
but
thou
shalt
not
go
thither
unto
the
land
which
i
give
the
children
of
israel
and
this
is
the
blessing
wherewith
moses
the
man
of
god
blessed
the
children
of
israel
before
his
death
and
he
said
the
lord
came
from
sinai
and
rose
up
from
seir
unto
them
he
shined
forth
from
mount
paran
and
he
came
with
ten
thousands
of
saints
from
his
right
hand
went
a
fiery
law
for
them
yea
he
loved
the
people
all
his
saints
are
in
thy
hand
and
they
sat
down
at
thy
feet
every
one
shall
receive
of
thy
words
moses
commanded
us
a
law
even
the
inheritance
of
the
congregation
of
jacob
and
he
was
king
in
jeshurun
when
the
heads
of
the
people
and
the
tribes
of
israel
were
gathered
together
let
reuben
live
and
not
die
and
let
not
his
men
be
few
and
this
is
the
blessing
of
judah
and
he
said
hear
lord
the
voice
of
judah
and
bring
him
unto
his
people
let
his
hands
be
sufficient
for
him
and
be
thou
an
help
to
him
from
his
enemies
and
of
levi
he
said
let
thy
thummim
and
thy
urim
be
with
thy
holy
one
whom
thou
didst
prove
at
massah
and
with
whom
thou
didst
strive
at
the
waters
of
meribah
who
said
unto
his
father
and
to
his
mother
i
have
not
seen
him
neither
did
he
acknowledge
his
brethren
nor
knew
his
own
children
for
they
have
observed
thy
word
and
kept
thy
covenant
they
shall
teach
jacob
thy
judgments
and
israel
thy
law
they
shall
put
incense
before
thee
and
whole
burnt
sacrifice
upon
thine
altar
bless
lord
his
substance
and
accept
the
work
of
his
hands
smite
through
the
loins
of
them
that
rise
against
him
and
of
them
that
hate
him
that
they
rise
not
again
and
of
benjamin
he
said
the
beloved
of
the
lord
shall
dwell
in
safety
by
him
and
the
lord
shall
cover
him
all
the
day
long
and
he
shall
dwell
between
his
shoulders
and
of
joseph
he
said
blessed
of
the
lord
be
his
land
for
the
precious
things
of
heaven
for
the
dew
and
for
the
deep
that
coucheth
beneath
and
for
the
precious
fruits
brought
forth
by
the
sun
and
for
the
precious
things
put
forth
by
the
moon
and
for
the
chief
things
of
the
ancient
mountains
and
for
the
precious
things
of
the
lasting
hills
and
for
the
precious
things
of
the
earth
and
fulness
thereof
and
for
the
good
will
of
him
that
dwelt
in
the
bush
let
the
blessing
come
upon
the
head
of
joseph
and
upon
the
top
of
the
head
of
him
that
was
separated
from
his
brethren
his
glory
is
like
the
firstling
of
his
bullock
and
his
horns
are
like
the
horns
of
unicorns
with
them
he
shall
push
the

and
they
are

he
said

in
thy
going
out
and
issachar
in
thy
tents
they
shall
call
the
people
unto
the
mountain

offer

for
they
shall
suck
of

that

he
dwelleth

a
lion
and
teareth
the
arm
with
the
crown
of
the
head
and
he
provided
the
first
part
for

because
there
in
a
portion
of
the
lawgiver
was
he
seated
and
he
came
with
the
heads
of
the
people
he
executed
the
justice
of
the
lord
and
his
judgments
with
israel
and
of

said
o

and
full
with
the
blessing
of
the
lord

the
west
and
the
south
and
of
asher
he
said
let
asher
be
blessed
with
children
let
him
be
acceptable
to
his
brethren
and
let
him
dip
his
foot
in
oil
thy
shoes
shall
be
iron
and
brass
and
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
be
there
is
none
like
unto
the
god
of
jeshurun
who
rideth
upon
the
heaven
in
thy
help
and
in
his
excellency
on
the
sky
the
eternal
god
is
thy
refuge
and
underneath
are
the
everlasting
arms
and
he
shall
thrust
out
the
enemy
from
before
thee
and
shall
say
destroy
them
israel
then
shall
dwell
in
safety
alone
the
fountain
of
jacob
shall
be
upon
a
land
of

also
his

happy
art
thou
o
israel
who
is
like
unto
thee
o
people
saved
by
the
lord
the
shield
of
thy
help
and
who
is
the
sword
of
thy
excellency
and
thine
enemies
shall
be
found
liars
unto
thee
and
thou
shalt
tread
upon
their
high
places
and
moses
went
up
from
the
plains
of
moab
unto
the
mountain
of
nebo
to
the
top
of
pisgah
that
is
over
against
jericho
and
the
lord
shewed
him
all
the
land
of
gilead
unto
dan
and
all
naphtali
and
the
land
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
and
all
the
land
of
judah
unto
the
utmost
sea
and
the
south
and
the
plain
of
the
valley
of
jericho
the
city
of
palm
trees
unto
zoar
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
this
is
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
saying
i
will
give
it
unto
thy
seed
i
have
caused
thee
to
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
thou
shalt
not
go
over
thither
so
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
there
in
the
land
of
moab
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
he
buried
him
in
a
valley
in
the
land
of
moab
over
against
bethpeor
but
no
man
knoweth
of
his
sepulchre
unto
this
day
and
moses
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
died
his
eye
was
not
dim
nor
his
natural
force
abated
and
the
children
of
israel
wept
for
moses
in
the
plains
of
moab
thirty
days
so
the
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
for
moses
were
ended
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
wisdom
for
moses
had
laid
his
hands
upon
him
and
the
children
of
israel
hearkened
unto
him
and
did
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
israel
like
unto
moses
whom
the
lord
knew
face
to
face
in
all
the
signs
and
the
wonders
which
the
lord
sent
him
to
do
in
the
land
of
egypt
to
pharaoh
and
to
all
his
servants
and
to
all
his
land
and
in
all
that
mighty
hand
and
in
all
the
great
terror
which
moses
shewed
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
the
book
of
joshua
now
after
the
death
of
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
the
son
of
nun
moses
minister
saying
moses
my
servant
is
dead
now
therefore
arise
go
over
this
jordan
thou
and
all
this
people
unto
the
land
which
i
do
give
to
them
even
to
the
children
of
israel
every
place
that
the
sole
of
your
foot
shall
tread
upon
that
have
i
given
unto
you
as
i
said
unto
moses
from
the
wilderness
and
this
lebanon
even
unto
the
great
river
the
river
euphrates
all
the
land
of
the
hittites
and
unto
the
great
sea
toward
the
going
down
of
the
sun
shall
be
your
coast
there
shall
not
any
man
be
able
to
stand
before
thee
all
the
days
of
thy
life
as
i
was
with
moses
so
i
will
be
with
thee
i
will
not
fail
thee
nor
forsake
thee
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
for
unto
this
people
shalt
thou
divide
for
an
inheritance
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
their
fathers
to
give
them
only
be
thou
strong
and
very
courageous
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
the
law
which
moses
my
servant
commanded
thee

not
from
it
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
that
thou
mayest
prosper
withersoever
thou
goest

book
of
the
law

out
of
thy
mouth
but
thou
shalt
meditate
therein
day
and
night
that
thou
mayest
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
is
written
therein
for

thou
shalt
make

a
good
courage
be
not
afraid
neither
be
thou
dismayed
for
the
lord
thy
god
is
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
goest
then
joshua
commanded
the
officers
of
the
people
saying
pass
through
the
host
and
command
the
people
saying
prepare
you
victuals
for
within
three
days
ye
shall
pass
over
this
jordan
to
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
you
to
possess
it
and
to
the
reubenites
and
to
the
gadites
and
to
half
the
tribe
of
manasseh
spake
joshua
saying
remember
the
word
which
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
you
saying
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
rest
and
hath
given
you
this
land
your
wives
your
little
ones
and
your
cattle
shall
remain
in
the
land
which
moses
gave
you
on
this
side
jordan
but
ye
shall
pass
before
your
brethren
armed
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
help
them
until
the
lord
have
given
your
brethren
rest
as
he
hath
given
you
and
they
also
have
possessed
the
land
which
the
lord
your
god
giveth
them
then
ye
shall
return
unto
the
land
of
your
possession
and
enjoy
it
which
moses
the
lord's
servant
gave
you
on
this
side
jordan
toward
the
sunrising
and
they
answered
joshua
saying
all
that
thou
commandest
us
we
will
do
and
whithersoever
thou
sendest
us
we
will
go
according
as
we
hearkened
unto
moses
in
all
things
so
will
we
hearken
unto
thee
only
the
lord
thy
god
be
with
thee
as
he
was
with
moses
whosoever
he
be
that
doth
rebel
against
thy
commandment
and
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
in
all
that
thou
commandest
him
he
shall
be
put
to
death
only
be
strong
and
of
a
good
courage
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
sent
out
of
shittim
two
men
to
spy
secretly
saying
go
view
the
land
even
jericho
and
they
went
and
came
into
an
harlot's
house
named
rahab
and
lodged
there
and
it
was
told
the
king
of
jericho
saying
behold
there
came
men
in
hither
to
night
of
the
children
of
israel
to
search
out
the
country
and
the
king
of
jericho
sent
unto
rahab
saying
bring
forth
the
men
that
are
come
to
thee
which
are
entered
into
thine
house
for
they
be
come
to
search
out
all
the
country
and
the
woman
took
the
two
men
and
hid
them
and
said
thus
there
came
men
unto
me
but
i
wist
not
whence
they
were
and
it
came
to
pass
about
the
time
of
shutting
of
the
gate
when
it
was
dark
that
the
men
went
out
whither
the
men
went
i
wot
not
pursue
after
them
quickly
for
ye
shall
overtake
them
but
she
had
brought
them
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
hid
them
with
the
stalks
of
flax
which
she
had
laid
in
order
upon
the
roof
and
the
men
pursued
after
them
the
way
to
jordan
unto
the
fords
and
as
soon
as
they
which
pursued
after
them
were
gone
out
they
shut
the
gate
and
before
they
were
laid
down
she
came
up
unto
them
upon
the
roof
and
she
said
unto
the
men
i
know
that
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
land
and
that
your
terror
is
fallen
upon
us
and
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
faint
because
of
you
for
we
have
heard
how
the
lord
dried
up
the
water
of
the
red
sea
for
you
when
ye
came
out
of
egypt
and
what
ye
did
unto
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
sihon
and
og
whom
ye
utterly
destroyed
and
as
soon
as
we
had
heard
these
things
our
hearts
did
melt
neither
did
there
remain
any
more
courage
in
any
man
because
of
you
for
the
lord
your
god
he
is
god
in
heaven
above
and
in
earth
beneath
now
therefore
i
pray
you
swear
unto
me
by
the
lord
since
i
have
shewed
you
kindness
that
ye
will
also
shew
kindness
unto
my
father's
house
and
give
me
a
true
token
and
that
ye
will
save
alive
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
brethren
and
my
sisters
and
all
that
they
have
and
deliver
our
lives
from
death
and
the
men
answered
her
our
life
for
yours
if
ye
utter
not
this
our
business
and
it
shall
be
when
the
lord
hath
given
us
the
land
that
we
will
deal
kindly
and
truly
with
thee
then
she
let
them
down
by
a
cord
through
the
window
for
her
house
was
upon
the
town
wall
and
she
dwelt
upon
the
wall
and
she
said
unto
them
get
you
to
the
mountain
lest
the
pursuers
meet
you
and
hide
yourselves
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
be
returned
and
afterward
may
ye
go
your
way
and
the
men
said
unto
her
we
will
be
blameless
of
this
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
us
swear
behold
when
we
come
into
the
land
thou
shalt
bind
this
line
of
scarlet
thread
in
the
window
which
thou
didst
let
us
down
by
and
thou
shalt
bring
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brethren
and
all
thy
father's
household
home
unto
thee
and
it
shall
be
that
whosoever
shall
go
out
of
the
doors
of
thy
house
into
the
street
his
blood
shall
be
upon
his
head
and
we
will
be
guiltless
and
whosoever
shall
be
with
thee
in
the
house
his
blood
shall
be
on
our
head
if
any
hand
be
upon
him
and
if
thou
utter
this
our
business
then
we
will
be
quit
of
thine
oath
which
thou
hast
made
us
to
swear
and
she
said
according
unto
your
words
so
be
it
and
she
sent
them
away
and
they
departed
and
she
bound
the
scarlet
line
in
the
window
and
they
went
and
came
unto
the
mountain
and
abode
there
three
days
until
the
pursuers
were
returned
and
the
pursuers
sought
them
throughout
all
the
way
but
found
them
not
so
the
two
men
returned
and
descended
from
the
mountain
and
passed
over
and
came
to
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
told
him
all
things
that
befell
them
and
they
said
unto
joshua
truly
the
lord
hath
delivered
into
our
hands
all
the
land
for
even
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
do
faint
because
of
us
and
joshua
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
they
removed
from
shittim
and
came
to
jordan
he
and
all
the
children
of
israel
and
lodged
there
before
they
passed
over
and
it
came
to
pass
after
three
days
that
the
officers
went
through
the
host
and
they
commanded
the
people
saying
when
ye
see
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
and
the
priests
the
levites
bearing
it
then
ye
shall
remove
from
your
place
and
go
after
it
yet
there
shall
be
a
space
between
you
and
it
about
two
thousand
cubits
by
measure
come
not
near
unto
it
that
ye
may
know
the
way
by
which
ye
must
go
for
ye
have
not
passed
this
way
heretofore
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
sanctify
yourselves
for
to
morrow
the
lord
will
do
wonders
among
you
and
joshua
spake
unto
the
priests
saying
take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
pass
over
before
the
people
and
they
took
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
went
before
the
people
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
this
day
will
i
begin
to
magnify
thee
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
that
they
may
know
that
as
i
was
with
moses
so
i
will
be
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
covenant
saying
when
ye
are
come
to
the
brink
of
the
water
of
jordan
ye
shall
stand
still
in
jordan
and
joshua
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
come
hither
and
hear
the
words
of
the
lord
your
god
and
joshua
said
hereby
ye
shall
know
that
the
living
god
is
among
you
and
that
he
will
without
fail
drive
out
from
before
you
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
hivites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
girgashites
and
the
amorites
and
the
jebusites
behold
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
passeth
over
before
you
into
jordan
now
therefore
take
you
twelve
men
out
of
the
tribes
of
israel
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
soon
as
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
lord
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
shall
rest
in
the
waters
of
jordan
that
the
waters
of
jordan
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
waters
that
come
down
from
above
and
they
shall
stand
upon
an
heap
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
people
removed
from
their
tents
to
pass
over
jordan
and
the
priests
bearing
the
ark
of
the
covenant
before
the
people
and
as
they
that
bare
the
ark
were
come
unto
jordan
and
the
feet
of
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
were
dipped
in
the
brim
of
the
water
for
jordan
overfloweth
all
his
banks
all
the
time
of
harvest
that
the
waters
which
came
down
from
above
stood
and
rose
up
upon
an
heap
very
far
from
the
city
adam
that
is
beside
zaretan
and
those
that
came
down
toward
the
sea
of
the
plain
even
the
salt
sea
failed
and
were
cut
off
and
the
people
passed
over
right
against
jericho
and
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
stood
firm
on
dry
ground
in
the
midst
of
jordan
and
all
the
israelites
passed
over
on
dry
ground
until
all
the
people
were
passed
clean
over
jordan
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
people
were
clean
passed
over
jordan
that
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
saying
take
you
twelve
men
out
of
the
people
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
and
command
ye
them
saying
take
you
hence
out
of
the
midst
of

out
of
the
place
where
the

and
ye
shall
carry
them
over
with
you
and
leave
them
in
the
lodging
place
where
ye
shall
lodge
this
night
then
joshua
called
the
twelve
men
whom
he
had
prepared
of
the
children
of
israel
out
of
every
tribe
a
man
and
joshua
said
unto
them
pass
over
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
your
god
into
the
midst
of
jordan
and
take
you
up
every
man
of
you
a
stone
upon
his
shoulder
according
unto
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
that
this
may
be
a
sign
among
you
that
when
your
children
ask
their
fathers
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
ye
by
these
stones
then
ye
shall
answer
them
that
the
waters
of
jordan
were
cut
off
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
when
it
passed
over
jordan
the
waters
of
jordan
were
cut
off
and
these
stones
shall
be
for
a
memorial
unto
the
children
of
israel
for
ever
and
the
children
of
israel
did
so
as
joshua
commanded
and
took
up
twelve
stones
out
of
the
midst
of
jordan
as
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
and
carried
them
over
with
them
unto
the
place
where
they
lodged
and
laid
them
down
there
and
joshua
set
up
twelve
stones
in
the
midst
of
jordan
in
the
place
where
the
feet
of
the
priests
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
stood
and
they
are
there
unto
this
day
for
the
priests
which
bare
the
ark
stood
in
the
midst
of
jordan
until
everything
was
finished
that
the
lord
commanded
joshua
to
speak
unto
the
people
according
to
all
that
moses
commanded
joshua
and
the
people
hasted
and
passed
over
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
people
were
clean
passed
over
that
the
ark
of
the
lord
passed
over
and
the
priests
in
the
presence
of
the
people
and
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
half
the
tribe
of
manasseh
passed
over
armed
before
the
children
of
israel
as
moses
spake
unto
them
about
forty
thousand
prepared
for
war
passed
over
before
the
lord
unto
battle
to
the
plains
of
jericho
on
that
day
the
lord
magnified
joshua
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
and
they
feared
him
as
they
feared
moses
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
the
lord
spake
unto
joshua
saying
command
the
priests
that
bear
the
ark
of
the
testimony
that
they
come
up
out
of
jordan
joshua
therefore
commanded
the
priests
saying
come
ye
up
out
of
jordan
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
were
come
up
out
of
the
midst
of
jordan
and
the
soles
of
the
priests
feet
were
lifted
up
unto
the
dry
land
that
the
waters
of
jordan
returned
unto
their
place
and
flowed
over
all
his
banks
as
they
did
before
and
the
people
came
up
out
of
jordan
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
encamped
in
gilgal
in
the
east
border
of
jericho
and
those
twelve
stones
which
they
took
out
of
jordan
did
joshua
pitch
in
gilgal
and
he
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
saying
when
your
children
shall
ask
their
fathers
in
time
to
come
saying
what
mean
these
stones
then
ye
shall
let
your
children
know
saying
israel
came
over
this
jordan
on
dry
land
for
the
lord
your
god
dried
up
the
waters
of
jordan
from
before
you
until
ye
were
passed
over
as
the
lord
your
god
did
to
the
red
sea
which
he
dried
up
from
before
us
until
we
were
gone
over
that
all
the
people
of
the
earth
might
know
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
it
is
mighty
that
ye
might
fear
the
lord
your
god
for
ever
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
kings
of
the
amorites
which
were
on
the
side
of
jordan
westward
and
all
the
kings
of
the
canaanites
which
were
by
the
sea
heard
that
the
lord
had
dried
up
the
waters
of
jordan
from
before
the
children
of
israel
until
we
were
passed
over
that
their
heart
melted
neither
was
there
spirit
in
them
any
more
because
of
the
children
of
israel
at
that
time
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
make
thee
sharp
knives
and
circumcise
again
the
children
of
israel
the
second
time
and
joshua
made
him
sharp
knives
and
circumcised
the
children
of
israel
at
the
hill
of
the
foreskins
and
this
is
the
cause
why
joshua
did
circumcise
all
the
people
that
came
out
of
egypt
that
were
males
even
all
the
men
of
war
died
in
the
wilderness
by
the
way
after
they
came
out
of
egypt
now
all
the
people
that
came
out
were
circumcised
but
all
the
people
that
were
born
in
the
wilderness
by
the
way
as
they
came
forth
out
of
egypt
them
they
had
not
circumcised
for
the
children
of
israel
walked
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
till
all
the
people
that
were
men
of
war
which
came
out
of
egypt
were
consumed
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
unto
whom
the
lord
sware
that
he
would
not
shew
them
the
land
which
the
lord
sware
unto
their
fathers
that
he
would
give
us
a
land
that
floweth
with
milk
and
honey
and
their
children
whom
he
raised
up
in
their
stead
them
joshua
circumcised
for
they
were
uncircumcised
because
they
had
not
circumcised
them
by
the
way
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
done
circumcising
all
the
people
that
they
abode
in
their
places
in
the
camp
till
they
were
whole
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
this
day
have
i
rolled
away
the
reproach
of
egypt
from
off
you
wherefore
the
name
of
the
place
is
called
gilgal
unto
this
day
and
the
children
of
israel
encamped
in
gilgal
and
kept
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
at
even
in
the
plains
of
jericho
and
they
did
eat
of
the
old
corn
of
the
land
on
the
morrow
after
the
passover
unleavened
cakes
and
parched
corn
in
the
selfsame
day
and
the
manna
ceased
on
the
morrow
after
they
had
eaten
of
the
old
corn
of
the
land
neither
had
the
children
of
israel
manna
any
more
but
they
did
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
land
of
canaan
that
year
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
was
by
jericho
that
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
stood
a
man
over
against
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
joshua
went
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
for
us
or
for
our
adversaries
and
he
said
nay
but
as
captain
of
the
host
of
the
lord
am
i
now
come
and
joshua
fell
on
his
face
to
the
earth
and
did
worship
and
said
unto
him
what
saith
my
lord
unto
his
servant
and
the
captain
of
the
lord's
host
said
unto
joshua
loose
thy
shoe
from
off
thy
foot
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
and
joshua
did
so
now
jericho
was
straitly
shut
up
because
of
the
children
of
israel
none
went
out
and
none
came
in
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
see
i
have
given
into
thine
hand
jericho
and
the
king
thereof
and
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
ye
shall
compass
the
city
all
ye
men
of
war
and
go
round
about
the
city
once
thus
shalt
thou
do
six
days
and
seven
priests
shall
bear
before
the
ark
seven
trumpets
of
rams
horns
and
the
seventh
day
ye
shall
compass
the
city
seven
times
and
the
priests
shall
blow
with
the
trumpets
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
make
a
long
blast
with
the
ram's
horn
and
when
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
all
the
people
shall
shout
with
a
great
shout
and
the
wall
of
the
city
shall
fall
down
flat
and
the
people
shall
ascend
up
every
man
straight
before
him
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
called
the
priests
and
said
unto
them
take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
let
seven
priests
bear
seven
trumpets
of
rams
horns
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
he
said
unto
the
people
pass
on
and
compass
the
city
and
let
him
that
is
armed
pass
on
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
had
spoken
unto
the
people
that
the
seven
priests
bearing
the
seven
trumpets
of
rams
horns
passed
on
before
the
lord
and
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
followed
them
and
the
armed
men
went
before
the
priests
that
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
rereward
came
after
the
ark
the
priests
going
on
and
blowing
with
the
trumpets
and
joshua
had
commanded
the
people
saying
ye
shall
not
shout
nor
make
any
noise
with
your
voice
neither
shall
any
word
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
until
the
day
i
bid
you
shout
then
shall
ye
shout
so
the
ark
of
the
lord
compassed
the
city
going
about
it
once
and
they
came
into
the
camp
and
lodged
in
the
camp
and
joshua
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
the
priests
took
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
seven
priests
bearing
seven
trumpets
of
rams
horns
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
went
on
continually
and
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
the
armed
men
went
before
them
but
the
rereward
came
after
the
ark
of
the
lord
the
priests
going
on
and
blowing
with
the
trumpets
and
the
second
day
they
compassed
the
city
once
and
returned
into
the
camp
so
they
did
six
days
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
they
rose
early
about
the
dawning
of
the
day
and
compassed
the
city
after
the
same
manner
seven
times
only
on
that
day
they
compassed
the
city
seven
times
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seventh
time
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
trumpets
joshua
said
unto
the
people
shout
for
the
lord
hath
given
you
the
city
and
the
city
shall
be
accursed
even
it
and
all
that
are
therein
to
the
lord
only
rahab
the
harlot
shall
live
she
and
all
that
are
with
her
in
the
house
because
she
hid
the
messengers
that
we
sent
and
ye
in
any
wise
keep
yourselves
from
the
accursed
thing
lest
ye
make
yourselves
accursed
when
ye
take
of
the
accursed
thing
and
make
the
camp
of
israel
a
curse
and
trouble
it
but
all
the
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
of
brass
and
iron
are
consecrated
unto
the
lord
they
shall
come
into
the
treasury
of
the
lord
so
the
people
shouted
when
the
priests
blew
with
the
trumpets
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
the
people
shouted
with
a
great
shout
that
the
wall
fell
down
flat
so
that
the
people
went
up
into
the
city
every
man
straight
before
him
and
they
took
the
city
and
they
utterly
destroyed
all
that
was
in
the
city
both
man
and
woman
young
and
old
and
ox
and
sheep
and
ass
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
joshua
had
said
unto
the
two
men
that
had
spied
out
the
country
go
into
the
harlot's
house
and
bring
out
thence
the
woman
and
all
that
she
hath
as
ye
sware
unto
her
and
the
young
men
that
were
spies
went
in
and
brought
out
rahab
and
her
father
and
her
mother
and
her
brethren
and
all
that
she
had
and
they
brought
out
all
her
kindred
and
left
them
without
the
camp
of
israel
and
they
burnt
the
city
with
fire
and
all
that
was
therein
only
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
of
brass
and
of
iron
they
put
into
the
treasury
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
joshua
saved
rahab
the
harlot
alive
and
her
father's
household
and
all
that
she
had
and
she
dwelleth
in
israel
even
unto
this
day
because
she
hid
the
messengers
which
joshua
sent
to
spy
out
jericho
and
joshua
adjured
them
at
that
time
saying
cursed
be
the
man
before
the
lord
that
riseth
up
and
buildeth
this
city
jericho
he
shall
lay
the
foundation
thereof
in
his
firstborn
and
in
his
youngest
son
shall
he
set
up
the
gates
of
it
so
the
lord
was
with
joshua
and
his
fame
was
noised
throughout
all
the
country
but
the
children
of
israel
committed
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
thing
for
achan
the
son
of
carmi
the
son
of
zabdi
the
son
of
zerah
of
the
tribe
of
judah
took
of
the
accursed
thing
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
the
children
of
israel
and
joshua
sent
men
from
jericho
to
ai
which
is
beside
bethaven
on
the
east
of
bethel
and
spake
unto
them
saying
go
up
and
view
the
country
and
the
men
went
up
and
viewed
ai
and
they
returned
to
joshua
and
said
unto
him
let
not
all
the
people
go
up
but
let
about
two
or
three
thousand
men
go
up
and
smite
ai
and
make
not
all
the
people
to
labour
thither
for
they
are
but
few
so
there
went
up
thither
of
the
people
about
three
thousand
men
and
they
fled
before
the
men
of
ai
and
the
men
of
ai
smote
of
them
about
thirty
and
six
men
for
they
chased
them
from
before
the
gate
even
unto
shebarim
and
smote
them
in
the
going
down
wherefore
the
hearts
of
the
people
melted
and
became
as
water
and
joshua
rent
his
clothes
and
fell
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
until
the
eventide
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
put
dust
upon
their
heads
and
joshua
said
alas
o
lord
god
wherefore
hast
thou
at
all
brought
this
people
over
jordan
to
deliver
us
into
the
hand
of
the
amorites
to
destroy
us
would
to
god
we
had
been
content
and
dwelt
on
the
other
side
jordan
o
lord
what
shall
i
say
when
israel
turneth
their
backs
before
their
enemies
for
the
canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
shall
hear
of
it
and
shall
environ
us
round
and
cut
off
our
name
from
the
earth
and
what
wilt
thou
do
unto
thy
great
name
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
get
thee
up
wherefore
liest
thou
thus
upon
thy
face
israel
hath
sinned
and
they
have
also
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
them
for
they
have
even
taken
of
the
accursed
thing
and
have
also
stolen
and
dissembled
also
and
they
have
put
it
even
among
their
own
stuff
therefore
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stand
before
their
enemies
but
turned
their
backs
before
their
enemies
because
they
were
accursed
neither
will
i
be
with
you
any
more
except
ye
destroy
the
accursed
from
among
you
up
sanctify
the
people
and
say
sanctify
yourselves
against
to
morrow
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
an
accursed
thing
in
the
midst
of
thee
o
israel
thou
canst
not
stand
before
thine
enemies
until
ye
take
away
the
accursed
thing
from
among
you
in
the
morning
therefore
ye
shall
be
brought
according
to
your
tribes
and
it
shall
be
that
the
tribe
which
the
lord
taketh
shall
come
according
to
the
families
thereof
and
the
family
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
by
households
and
the
household
which
the
lord
shall
take
shall
come
man
by
man
and
it
shall
be
that
he
that
is
taken
with
the
accursed
thing
shall
be
burnt
with
fire
he
and
all
that
he
hath
because
he
hath
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
because
he
hath
wrought
folly
in
israel
so
joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
brought
israel
by
their
tribes
and
the
tribe
of
judah
was
taken
and
he
brought
the
family
of
judah
and
he
took
the
family
of
the
zarhites
and
he
brought
the
family
of
the
zarhites
man
by
man
and
zabdi
was
taken
and
he
brought
his
household
man
by
man
and
achan
the
son
of
carmi
the
son
of
zabdi
the
son
of
zerah
of
the
tribe
of
judah
was
taken
and
joshua
said
unto
achan
my
son
give
i
pray
thee
glory
to
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
make
confession
unto
him
and
tell
me
now
what
thou
hast
done
hide
it
not
from
me
and
achan
answered
joshua
and
said
indeed
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
i
done
when
i
saw
among
the
spoils
a
goodly
babylonish
garment
and
two
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
a
wedge
of
gold
of
fifty
shekels
weight
then
i
coveted
them
and
took
them
and
behold
they
are
hid
in
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
my
tent
and
the
silver
under
it
so
joshua
sent
messengers
and
they
ran
unto
the
tent
and
behold
it
was
hid
in
his
tent
and
the
silver
under
it
and
they
took
them
out
of
the
midst
of
the
tent
and
brought
them
unto
joshua
and
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
laid
them
out
before
the
lord
and
joshua
and
all
israel
with
him
took
achan
the
son
of
zerah
and
the
silver
and
the
garment
and
the
wedge
of
gold
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
his
oxen
and
his
asses
and
his
sheep
and
his
tent
and
all
that
he
had
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
valley
of
achor
and
joshua
said
why
hast
thou
troubled
us
the
lord
shall
trouble
thee
this
day
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
and
burned
them
with
fire
after
they
had
stoned
them
with
stones
and
they
raised
over
him
a
great
heap
of
stones
unto
this
day
so
the
lord
turned
from
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
wherefore
the
name
of
that
place
was
called
the
valley
of
achor
unto
this
day
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
fear
not
neither
be
thou
dismayed
take
all
the
people
of
war
with
thee
and
arise
go
up
to
ai
see
i
have
given
into
thy
hand
the
king
of
ai
and
his
people
and
his
city
and
his
land
and
thou
shalt
do
to
ai
and
her
king
as
thou
didst
unto
jericho
and
her
king
only
the
spoil
thereof
and
the
cattle
thereof
shall
ye
take
for
a
prey
unto
yourselves
lay
thee
an
ambush
for
the
city
behind
it
so
joshua
arose
and
all
the
people
of
war
to
go
up
against
ai
and
joshua
chose
out
thirty
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
and
sent
them
away
by
night
and
he
commanded
them
saying
behold
ye
shall
lie
in
wait
against
the
city
even
behind
the
city
go
not
very
far
from
the
city
but
be
ye
all
ready
and
i
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
me
will
approach
unto
the
city
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
they
come
out
against
us
as
at
the
first
that
we
will
flee
before
them
for
they
will
come
out
after
us
till
we
have
drawn
them
from
the
city
for
they
will
say
they
flee
before
us
as
at
the
first
therefore
we
will
flee
before
them
then
ye
shall
rise
up
from
the
ambush
and
seize
upon
the
city
for
the
lord
your
god
will
deliver
it
into
your
hand
and
it
shall
be
when
ye
have
taken
the
city
that
ye
shall
set
the
city
on
fire
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
shall
ye
do
see
i
have
commanded
you
joshua
therefore
sent
them
forth
and
they
went
to
lie
in
ambush
and
abode
between
bethel
and
ai
on
the
west
side
of
ai
but
joshua
lodged
that
night
among
the
people
and
joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
numbered
the
people
and
went
up
he
and
the
elders
of
israel
before
the
people
to
ai
and
all
the
people
even
the
people
of
war
that
were
with
him
went
up
and
drew
nigh
and
came
before
the
city
and
pitched
on
the
north
side
of
ai
now
there
was
a
valley
between
them
and
ai
and
he
took
about
five
thousand
men
and
set
them
to
lie
in
ambush
between
bethel
and
ai
on
the
west
side
of
the
city
and
when
they
had
set
the
people
even
all
the
host
that
was
on
the
north
of
the
city
and
their
liers
in
wait
on
the
west
of
the
city
joshua
went
that
night
into
the
midst
of
the
valley
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
of
ai
saw
it
that
they
hasted
and
rose
up
early
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
against
israel
to
battle
he
and
all
his
people
at
a
time
appointed
before
the
plain
but
he
wist
not
that
there
were
liers
in
ambush
against
him
behind
the
city
and
joshua
and
all
israel
made
as
if
they
were
beaten
before
them
and
fled
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
and
all
the
people
that
were
in
ai
were
called
together
to
pursue
after
them
and
they
pursued
after
joshua
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
and
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
ai
or
bethel
that
went
not
out
after
israel
and
they
left
the
city
open
and
pursued
after
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
stretch
out
the
spear
that
is
in
thy
hand
toward
ai
for
i
will
give
it
into
thine
hand
and
joshua
stretched
out
the
spear
that
he
had
in
his
hand
toward
the
city
and
the
ambush
arose
quickly
out
of
their
place
and
they
ran
as
soon
as
he
had
stretched
out
his
hand
and
they
entered
into
the
city
and
took
it
and
hasted
and
set
the
city
on
fire
and
when
the
men
of
ai
looked
behind
them
they
saw
and
behold
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven
and
they
had
no
power
to
flee
this
way
or
that
way
and
the
people
that
fled
to
the
wilderness
turned
back
upon
the
pursuers
and
when
joshua
and
all
israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
taken
the
city
and
that
the
smoke
of
the
city
ascended
then
they
turned
again
and
slew
the
men
of
ai
and
the
other
issued
out
of
the
city
against
them
so
they
were
in
the
midst
of
israel
some
on
this
side
and
some
on
that
side
and
they
smote
them
so
that
they
let
none
of
them
remain
or
escape
and
the
king
of
ai
they
took
alive
and
brought
him
to
joshua
and
it
came
to
pass
when
israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
all
the
inhabitants
of
ai
in
the
field
in
the
wilderness
wherein
they
chased
them
and
when
they
were
all
fallen
on
the
edge
of
the
sword
until
they
were
consumed
that
all
the
israelites
returned
unto
ai
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
so
it
was
that
all
that
fell
that
day
both
of
men
and
women
were
twelve
thousand
even
all
the
men
of
ai
for
joshua
drew
not
his
hand
back
wherewith
he
stretched
out
the
spear
until
he
had
utterly
destroyed
all
the
inhabitants
of
ai
only
the
cattle
and
the
spoil
of
that
city
israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
commanded
joshua
and
joshua
burnt
ai
and
made
it
an
heap
for
ever
even
a
desolation
unto
this
day
and
the
king
of
ai
he
hanged
on
a
tree
until
eventide
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down
joshua
commanded
that
they
should
take
his
carcase
down
from
the
tree
and
cast
it
at
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
raise
thereon
a
great
heap
of
stones
that
remaineth
unto
this
day
then
joshua
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
in
mount
ebal
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
the
children
of
israel
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
an
altar
of
whole
stones
over
which
no
man
hath
lift
up
any
iron
and
they
offered
thereon
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
sacrificed
peace
offerings
and
he
wrote
there
upon
the
stones
a
copy
of
the
law
of
moses
which
he
wrote
in
the
presence
of
the
children
of
israel
and
all
israel
and
their
elders
and
officers
and
their
judges
stood
on
this
side
the
ark
and
on
that
side
before
the
priests
the
levites
which
bare
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
as
well
the
stranger
as
he
that
was
born
among
them
half
of
them
over
against
mount
gerizim
and
half
of
them
over
against
mount
ebal
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
had
commanded
before
that
they
should
bless
the
people
of
israel
and
afterward
he
read
all
the
words
of
the
law
the
blessings
and
cursings
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
there
was
not
a
word
of
all
that
moses
commanded
which
joshua
read
not
before
all
the
congregation
of
israel
with
the
women
and
the
little
ones
and
the
strangers
that
were
conversant
among
them
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
the
kings
which
were
on
this
side
jordan
in
the
hills
and
in
the
valleys
and
in
all
the
coasts
of
the
great
sea
over
against
lebanon
the
hittite
and
the
amorite
the
canaanite
the
perizzite
the
hivite
and
the
jebusite
heard
thereof
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
to
fight
with
joshua
and
with
israel
with
one
accord
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
heard
what
joshua
had
done
unto
jericho
and
to
ai
they
did
work
wilily
and
went
and
made
as
if
they
had
been
ambassadors
and
took
old
sacks
upon
their
asses
and
wine
bottles
old
and
rent
and
bound
up
and
old
shoes
and
clouted
upon
their
feet
and
old
garments
upon
them
and
all
the
bread
of
their
provision
was
dry
and
mouldy
and
they
went
to
joshua
unto
the
camp
at
gilgal
and
said
unto
him
and
to
the
men
of
israel
we
be
come
from
a
far
country
now
therefore
make
ye
a
league
with
us
and
the
men
of
israel
said
unto
the
hivites
peradventure
ye
dwell
among
us
and
how
shall
we
make
a
league
with
you
and
they
said
unto
joshua
we
are
thy
servants
and
joshua
said
unto
them
who
are
ye
and
from
whence
come
ye
and
they
said
unto
him
from
a
very
far
country
thy
servants
are
come
because
of
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
for
we
have
heard
the
fame
of
him
and
all
that
he
did
in
egypt
and
all
that
he
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
that
were
beyond
jordan
to
sihon
king
of
heshbon
and
to
og
king
of
bashan
which
was
at
ashtaroth
wherefore
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
country
spake
to
us
saying
take
victuals
with
you
for
the
journey
and
go
to
meet
them
and
say
unto
them
we
are
your
servants
therefore
now
make
ye
a
league
with
us
this
our
bread
we
took
hot
for
our
provision
out
of
our
houses
on
the
day
we
came
forth
to
go
unto
you
but
now
behold
it
is
dry
and
it
is
mouldy
and
these
bottles
of
wine
which
we
filled
were
new
and
behold
they
be
rent
and
these
our
garments
and
our
shoes
are
become
old
by
reason
of
the
very
long
journey
and
the
men
took
of
their
victuals
and
asked
not
counsel
at
the
mouth
of
the
lord
and
joshua
made
peace
with
them
and
made
a
league
with
them
to
let
them
live
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
sware
unto
them
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
days
after
they
had
made
a
league
with
them
that
they
heard
that
they
were
their
neighbours
and
that
they
dwelt
among
them
and
the
children
of
israel
journeyed
and
came
unto
their
cities
on
the
third
day
now
their
cities
were
gibeon
and
chephirah
and
beeroth
and
kirjathjearim
and
the
children
of
israel
smote
them
not
because
the
princes
of
the
congregation
had
sworn
unto
them
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
all
the
congregation
murmured
against
the
princes
but
all
the
princes
said
unto
all
the
congregation
we
have
sworn
unto
them
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
now
therefore
we
may
not
touch
them
this
we
will
do
to
them
we
will
even
let
them
live
lest
wrath
be
upon
us
because
of
the
oath
which
we
sware
unto
them
and
the
princes
said
unto
them
let
them
live
but
let
them
be
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
unto
all
the
congregation
as
the
princes
had
promised
them
and
joshua
called
for
them
and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
wherefore
have
ye
beguiled
us
saying
we
are
very
far
from
you
when
ye
dwell
among
us
now
therefore
ye
are
cursed
and
there
shall
none
of
you
be
freed
from
being
bondmen
and
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
house
of
my
god
and
they
answered
joshua
and
said
because
it
was
certainly
told
thy
servants
how
that
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
his
servant
moses
to
give
you
all
the
land
and
to
destroy
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you
therefore
we
were
sore
afraid
of
our
lives
because
of
you
and
have
done
this
thing
and
now
behold
we
are
in
thine
hand
as
it
seemeth
good
and
right
unto
thee
to
do
unto
us
do
and
so
did
he
unto
them
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
children
of
israel
that
they
slew
them
not
and
joshua
made
them
that
day
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
congregation
and
for
the
altar
of
the
lord
even
unto
this
day
in
the
place
which
he
should
choose
now
it
came
to
pass
when
adonizedec
king
of
jerusalem
had
heard
how
joshua
had
taken
ai
and
had
utterly
destroyed
it
as
he
had
done
to
jericho
and
her
king
so
he
had
done
to
ai
and
her
king
and
how
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
had
made
peace
with
israel
and
were
among
them
that
they
feared
greatly
because
gibeon
was
a
great
city
as
one
of
the
royal
cities
and
because
it
was
greater
than
ai
and
all
the
men
thereof
were
mighty
wherefore
adonizedec
king
of
jerusalem
sent
unto
hoham
king
of
hebron
and
unto
piram
king
of
jarmuth
and
unto
japhia
king
of
lachish
and
unto
debir
king
of
eglon
saying
come
up
unto
me
and
help
me
that
we
may
smite
gibeon
for
it
hath
made
peace
with
joshua
and
with
the
children
of
israel
therefore
the
five
kings
of
the
amorites
the
king
of
jerusalem
the
king
of
hebron
the
king
of
jarmuth
the
king
of
lachish
the
king
of
eglon
gathered
themselves
together
and
went
up
they
and
all
their
hosts
and
encamped
before
gibeon
and
made
war
against
it
and
the
men
of
gibeon
sent
unto
joshua
to
the
camp
to
gilgal
saying
slack
not
thy
hand
from
thy
servants
come
up
to
us
quickly
and
save
us
and
help
us
for
all
the
kings
of
the
amorites
that
dwell
in
the
mountains
are
gathered
together
against
us
so
joshua
ascended
from
gilgal
he
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him
and
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
fear
them
not
for
i
have
delivered
them
into
thine
hand
there
shall
not
a
man
of
them
stand
before
thee
joshua
therefore
came
unto
them
suddenly
and
went
up
from
gilgal
all
night
and
the
lord
discomfited
them
before
israel
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
at
gibeon
and
chased
them
along
the
way
that
goeth
up
to
bethhoron
and
smote
them
to
azekah
and
unto
makkedah
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
fled
from
before
israel
and
were
in
the
going
down
to
bethhoron
that
the
lord
cast
down
great
stones
from
heaven
upon
them
unto
azekah
and
they
died
they
were
more
which
died
with
hailstones
than
they
whom
the
children
of
israel
slew
with
the
sword
then
spake
joshua
to
the
lord
in
the
day
when
the
lord
delivered
up
the
amorites
before
the
children
of
israel
and
he
said
in
the
sight
of
israel
sun
stand
thou
still
upon
gibeon
and
thou
moon
in
the
valley
of
ajalon
and
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
moon
stayed
until
the
people
had
avenged
themselves
upon
their
enemies
is
not
this
written
in
the
book
of
jasher
so
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
heaven
and
hasted
not
to
go
down
about
a
whole
day
and
there
was
no
day
like
that
before
it
or
after
it
that
the
lord
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
a
man
for
the
lord
fought
for
israel
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
the
camp
to
gilgal
but
these
five
kings
fled
and
hid
themselves
in
a
cave
at
makkedah
and
it
was
told
joshua
saying
the
five
kings
are
found
hid
in
a
cave
at
makkedah
and
joshua
said
roll
great
stones
upon
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
set
men
by
it
for
to
keep
them
and
stay
ye
not
but
pursue
after
your
enemies
and
smite
the
hindmost
of
them
suffer
them
not
to
enter
into
their
cities
for
the
lord
your
god
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joshua
and
the
children
of
israel
had
made
an
end
of
slaying
them
with
a
very
great
slaughter
till
they
were
consumed
that
the
rest
which
remained
of
them
entered
into
fenced
cities
and
all
the
people
returned
to
the
camp
to
joshua
at
makkedah
in
peace
none
moved
his
tongue
against
any
of
the
children
of
israel
then
said
joshua
open
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
bring
out
those
five
kings
unto
me
out
of
the
cave
and
they
did
so
and
brought
forth
those
five
kings
unto
him
out
of
the
cave
the
king
of
jerusalem
the
king
of
hebron
the
king
of
jarmuth
the
king
of
lachish
and
the
king
of
eglon
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
brought
out
those
kings
unto
joshua
that
joshua
called
for
all
the
men
of
israel
and
said
unto
the
captains
of
the
men
of
war
which
went
with
him
come
near
put
your
feet
upon
the
necks
of
these
kings
and
they
came
near
and
put
their
feet
upon
the
necks
of
them
and
joshua
said
unto
them
fear
not
nor
be
dismayed
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
for
thus
shall
the
lord
do
to
all
your
enemies
against
whom
ye
fight
and
afterward
joshua
smote
them
and
slew
them
and
hanged
them
on
five
trees
and
they
were
hanging
upon
the
trees
until
the
evening
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
going
down
of
the
sun
that
joshua
commanded
and
they
took
them
down
off
the
trees
and
cast
them
into
the
cave
wherein
they
had
been
hid
and
laid
great
stones
in
the
cave's
mouth
which
remain
until
this
very
day
and
that
day
joshua
took
makkedah
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
king
thereof
he
utterly
destroyed
them
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
let
none
remain
and
he
did
to
the
king
of
makkedah
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
jericho
then
joshua
passed
from
makkedah
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
libnah
and
fought
against
libnah
and
the
lord
delivered
it
also
and
the
king
thereof
into
the
hand
of
israel
and
he
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
let
none
remain
in
it
but
did
unto
the
king
thereof
as
he
did
unto
the
king
of
jericho
and
joshua
passed
from
libnah
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
lachish
and
encamped
against
it
and
fought
against
it
and
the
lord
delivered
lachish
into
the
hand
of
israel
which
took
it
on
the
second
day
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
libnah
then
horam
king
of
gezer
came
up
to
help
lachish
and
joshua
smote
him
and
his
people
until
he
had
left
him
none
remaining
and
from
lachish
joshua
passed
unto
eglon
and
all
israel
with
him
and
they
encamped
against
it
and
fought
against
it
and
they
took
it
on
that
day
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
utterly
destroyed
that
day
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
lachish
and
joshua
went
up
from
eglon
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
hebron
and
they
fought
against
it
and
they
took
it
and
smote
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
king
thereof
and
all
the
cities
thereof
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
left
none
remaining
according
to
all
that
he
had
done
to
eglon
but
destroyed
it
utterly
and
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
to
debir
and
fought
against
it
and
he
took
it
and
the
king
thereof
and
all
the
cities
thereof
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
he
left
none
remaining
as
he
had
done
to
hebron
so
he
did
to
debir
and
to
the
king
thereof
as
he
had
done
also
to
libnah
and
to
her
king
so
joshua
smote
all
the
country
of
the
hills
and
of
the
south
and
of
the
vale
and
of
the
springs
and
all
their
kings
he
left
none
remaining
but
utterly
destroyed
all
that
breathed
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
commanded
and
joshua
smote
them
from
kadeshbarnea
even
unto
gaza
and
all
the
country
of
goshen
even
unto
gibeon
and
all
these
kings
and
their
land
did
joshua
take
at
one
time
because
the
lord
god
of
israel
fought
for
israel
and
joshua
returned
and
all
israel
with
him
unto
the
camp
to
gilgal
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jabin
king
of
hazor
had
heard
those
things
that
he
sent
to
jobab
king
of
madon
and
to
the
king
of
shimron
and
to
the
king
of
achshaph
and
to
the
kings
that
were
on
the
north
of
the
mountains
and
of
the
plains
south
of
chinneroth
and
in
the
valley
and
in
the
borders
of
dor
on
the
west
and
to
the
canaanite
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
and
to
the
amorite
and
the
hittite
and
the
perizzite
and
the
jebusite
in
the
mountains
and
to
the
hivite
under
hermon
in
the
land
of
mizpeh
and
they
went
out
they
and
all
their
hosts
with
them
much
people
even
as
the
sand
that
is
upon
the
sea
shore
in
multitude
with
horses
and
chariots
very
many
and
when
all
these
kings
were
met
together
they
came
and
pitched
together
at
the
waters
of
merom
to
fight
against
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
joshua
be
not
afraid
because
of
them
for
to
morrow
about
this
time
will
i
deliver
them
up
all
slain
before
israel
thou
shalt
hough
their
horses
and
burn
their
chariots
with
fire
so
joshua
came
and
all
the
people
of
war
with
him
against
them
by
the
waters
of
merom
suddenly
and
they
fell
upon
them
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
who
smote
them
and
chased
them
unto
great
zidon
and
unto
misrephothmaim
and
unto
the
valley
of
mizpeh
eastward
and
they
smote
them
until
they
left
them
none
remaining
and
joshua
did
unto
them
as
the
lord
bade
him
he
houghed
their
horses
and
burnt
their
chariots
with
fire
and
joshua
at
that
time
turned
back
and
took
hazor
and
smote
the
king
thereof
with
the
sword
for
hazor
beforetime
was
the
head
of
all
those
kingdoms
and
they
smote
all
the
souls
that
were
therein
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
utterly
destroying
them
there
was
not
any
left
to
breathe
and
he
burnt
hazor
with
fire
and
all
the
cities
of
those
kings
and
all
the
kings
of
them
did
joshua
take
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
he
utterly
destroyed
them
as
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
but
as
for
the
cities
that
stood
still
in
their
strength
israel
burned
none
of
them
save
hazor
only
that
did
joshua
burn
and
all
the
spoil
of
these
cities
and
the
cattle
the
children
of
israel
took
for
a
prey
unto
themselves
but
every
man
they
smote
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
until
they
had
destroyed
them
neither
left
they
any
to
breathe
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
his
servant
so
did
moses
command
joshua
and
so
did
joshua
he
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
joshua
took
all
that
land
the
hills
and
all
the
south
country
and
all
the
land
of
goshen
and
the
valley
and
the
plain
and
the

that
goeth
up
to

even
unto
baalgad
in
the
valley
of
lebanon
under
mount
hermon
and
all
their
kings
he
took
and
smote
them
and
slew
them
joshua
made
war
a
long
time
with
all
those
kings
there
was
not
a
city
that
made
peace
with
the
children
of
israel
save
the
hivites
the
inhabitants
of
gibeon
all
other
they
took
in
battle
for
it
was
of
the
lord
to
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
come
against
israel
in
battle
that
he
might
destroy
them
utterly
and
that
they
might
have
no
favour
but
that
he
might
destroy
them
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
at
that
time
came
joshua
and
cut
off
the
anakims
from
the
mountains
from
hebron
from
debir
from
anab
and
from
all
the
mountains
of
judah
and
from
all
the

of
israel
joshua
destroyed
them
utterly
with
their
cities
there
was
none
of
the
anakims
left
in
the
land
of
the
children
of
israel
only
in
gaza
in
gath
and
in
ashdod
there
remained
so
joshua
took
the
whole
land
according
to
all
that
the
lord
said
unto
moses
and
joshua
gave
it
for
an
inheritance
unto
israel
according
to
their
divisions
by
their
tribes
and
the
land
rested

this

after

the

gave

countries
which

did
distribute

in

moab
on
the
other

jordan
by
jericho
eastward
but
unto
the
tribe
of
levi
moses
gave
not
any
inheritance
the
lord
god
of
israel
was
their
inheritance
as
he
said
unto
them
and
these
are
the
countries
which
the
children
of
israel
inherited
in
the
land
of
canaan
which
eleazar
the
priest
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
the
heads
of
the
fathers
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
distributed
for
inheritance
to
them
by
lot
was
their
inheritance
as
the
lord
commanded
by
the
hand
of
moses
for
the
nine
tribes
and
for
the
half
tribe
for
moses
had
given
the
inheritance
of
two
tribes
and
an
half
tribe
on
the
other
side
jordan
but
unto
the
levites
he
gave
none
inheritance
among
them
for
the
children
of
joseph
were
two
tribes
manasseh
and
ephraim
therefore
they
gave
no
part
unto
the
levites
in
the
land
save
cities
to
dwell
in
with
their
suburbs
for
their
cattle
and
for
their
substance
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
so
the
children
of
israel
did
and
they
divided
the
land
then
the
children
of
judah
came
unto
joshua
in
gilgal
and
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
said
unto
him
thou
knowest
the
thing
that
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
of
god
concerning
me
and
thee
in
kadeshbarnea
forty
years
old
was
i
when
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
sent
me
from
kadeshbarnea
to
espy
out
the
land
and
i
brought
him
word
again
as
it
was
in
mine
heart
nevertheless
my
brethren
that
went
up
with
me
made
the
heart
of
the
people
melt
but
i
wholly
followed
the
lord
my
god
and
moses
sware
on
that
day
saying
surely
the
land
whereon
thy
feet
have
trodden
shall
be
thine
inheritance
and
thy
children's
for
ever
because
thou
hast
wholly
followed
the
lord
my
god
and
now
behold
the
lord
hath
kept
me
alive
as
he
said
these
forty
and
five
years
even
since
the
lord
spake
this
word
unto
moses
while
the
children
of
israel
wandered
in
the
wilderness
and
now
lo
i
am
this
day
fourscore
and
five
years
old
as
yet
i
am
as
strong
this
day
as
i
was
in
the
day
that
moses
sent
me
as
my
strength
was
then
even
so
is
my
strength
now
for
war
both
to
go
out
and
to
come
in
now
therefore
give
me
this
mountain
whereof
the
lord
spake
in
that
day
for
thou
heardest
in
that
day
how
the
anakims
were
there
and
that
the
cities
were
great
and
fenced
if
so
be
the
lord
will
be
with
me
then
i
shall
be
able
to
drive
them
out
as
the
lord
said
and
joshua
blessed
him
and
gave
unto
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
hebron
for
an
inheritance
hebron
therefore
became
the
inheritance
of
caleb
the
son
of
jephunneh
the
kenezite
unto
this
day
because
that
he
wholly
followed
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
the
name
of
hebron
before
was
kirjatharba
which
arba
was
a
great
man
among

to

unto

the

and
to

and
the

so
the

manasseh

took

and
the

according

the

went

westward
unto
the

kanah
and
the
goings
out
thereof
were
at

this
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
the
children
of
ephraim
by
their
families
and
the
separate
cities
for
the
children
of
ephraim
were
among
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
manasseh
all
the
cities
with
their
villages
and
they
drave
not
out
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
gezer
but
the
canaanites
dwell
among
the
ephraimites
unto
this
day
and
serve
under
tribute
there
was
also
a
lot
for
the
tribe
of
manasseh
for
he
was
the
firstborn
of
joseph
to
wit
for
machir
the
firstborn
of
manasseh
the
father
of
gilead
because
he
was
a
man
of
war
therefore
he
had
gilead
and
bashan
there
was
also
a
lot
for
the
rest
of
the
children
of
manasseh
by
their
families
for
the
children
of
abiezer

these
were
the
male
children
of
manasseh
the
son
of
joseph
by

but
zelophehad
the
son
of
hepher
the
son
of
gilead
the
son
of
machir
the
son
of
manasseh
had
no
sons
but
daughters
and
these
are
the
names
of
his
daughters
mahlah
and
noah
hoglah
milcah
and
tirzah
and
they
came
near
before
eleazar
the

and
before
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
before
the
princes
saying
the
lord
commanded
moses
to
give
us
an
inheritance
among
our
brethren
therefore
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
he
gave
them
an
inheritance
among
the
brethren
of
their
father
and
there
fell
ten
portions
to
manasseh
beside
the
land
of
gilead
and
bashan
which
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
because
the
daughters
of
manasseh
had
an
inheritance
among
his
sons
and
the
rest
of
manasseh's
sons
had
the
land
of
gilead
and
the
coast
of
manasseh
was
from
asher
to
michmethah
that
lieth
before
shechem
and
the
border
went
along
on
the
right
hand
unto
the

the

southward
it

it

not
drive

the

the

would
dwell
in

yet
it
came
to

were
waxen
strong
that
they
put
the
canaanites
to

but
did
not
utterly
drive

out
and
the
children
of
joseph
spake
unto
joshua
saying
why
hast
thou
given
me
but
one
lot
and
one
portion
to
inherit
seeing
i
am
a
great
people
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
blessed
me
hitherto
and
joshua
answered
them
if
thou
be
a
great
people
then
get
thee
up
to
the
wood
country
and
cut
down
for
thyself
there
in
the
land
of
the
perizzites
and
of
the
giants
if
mount
ephraim
be
too
narrow
for
thee
and
the
children
of
joseph
said
the
hill
is
not
enough
for
us
and
all
the
canaanites
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
valley
have
chariots
of
iron
both
they
who
are
of
bethshean
and
her
towns
and
they
who
are
of
the
valley
of
jezreel
and
joshua
spake
unto
the
house
of
joseph
even
to
ephraim
and
to
manasseh
saying
thou
art
a
great
people
and
hast
great
power
thou
shalt
not
have
one
lot
only
but
the
mountain
shall
be
thine
for
it
is
a
wood
and
thou
shalt
cut
it
down
and
the
outgoings
of
it
shall
be
thine
for
thou
shalt
drive
out
the
canaanites
though
they
have
iron
chariots
and
though
they
be
strong
and
the
whole
congregation
of
the

ye

describe

and
bring

hither
to
me
that
i
may
cast

for

here

the
children
of

and
the

and
the

built
there
an
altar
by

altar
to

to
and
the

heard
say
behold
the
children
of

and
the

and
the
half
tribe
of

have
built
an
altar
over
against
the
land
of
canaan
in
the
borders
of
jordan
at
the
passage
of
the
children
of

and
when
the
children
of

heard
of
it
the
whole
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
at
shiloh
to
go
up
to
war
against
them
and
the
children
of
israel
sent
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
into
the
land
of
gilead
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
and
with
him
ten
princes
of
each
chief
house
a
prince
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
and
each
one
was
an
head
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
among
the
thousands
of
israel
and
they
came
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
unto
the
land
of
gilead
and
they
spake
with
them
saying
thus
saith
the
whole
congregation
of
the
lord
what
trespass
is
this
that
ye
have
committed
against
the
god
of
israel
to
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
lord
in
that
ye
have
builded
you
an
altar
that
ye
might
rebel
this
day
against
the
lord
is
the
iniquity
of
peor
too
little
for
us
from
which
we
are
not
cleansed
until
this
day
although
there
was
a
plague
in
the
congregation
of
the
lord
but
that
ye
must
turn
away
this
day
from
following
the
lord
and
it
will
be
seeing
ye
rebel
to
day
against
the
lord
that
to
morrow
he
will
be
wroth
with
the
whole
congregation
of
israel
notwithstanding
if
the
land
of
your
possession
be
unclean
then
pass
ye
over
unto
the
land
of
the
possession
of
the
lord
wherein
the
lord's
tabernacle
dwelleth
and
take
possession
among
us
but
rebel
not
against
the
lord
nor
rebel
against
us
in
building
you
an
altar
beside
the
altar
of
the
lord
our
god
did
not
achan
the
son
of
zerah
commit
a
trespass
in
the
accursed
thing
and
wrath
fell
on
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
that
man
perished
not
alone
in
his
iniquity
then
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
half
tribe
of
manasseh
answered
and
said
unto
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
israel
the
lord
god
of
gods
the
lord
god
of
gods
he
knoweth
and
israel
he
shall
know
if
it
be
in
rebellion
or
if
in
transgression
against
the
lord
save
us
not
this
day
that
we
have
built
us
an
altar
to
turn
from
following
the
lord
or
if
to
offer
thereon
burnt
offering
or
meat
offering
or
if
to
offer
peace
offerings
thereon
let
the
lord
himself
require
it
and
if
we
have
not
rather
done
it
for
fear
of
this
thing
saying
in
time
to
come
your
children
might
speak
unto
our
children
saying
what
have
ye
to
do
with
the
lord
god
of
israel
for
the
lord
hath
made
jordan
a
border
between
us
and
you
ye
children
of
reuben
and
children
of
gad
ye
have
no
part
in
the
lord
so
shall
your
children
make
our
children
cease
from
fearing
the
lord
therefore
we
said
let
us
now
prepare
to
build
us
an
altar
not
for
burnt
offering
nor
for
sacrifice
but
that
it
may
be
a
witness
between
us
and
you
and
our
generations
after
us
that
we
might
do
the
service
of
the
lord
before
him
with
our
burnt
offerings
and
with
our
sacrifices
and
with
our
peace
offerings
that
your
children
may
not
say
to
our
children
in
time
to
come
ye
have
no
part
in
the
lord
therefore
said
we
that
it
shall
be
when
they
should
so
say
to
us
or
to
our
generations
in
time
to
come
that
we
may
say
again
behold
the
pattern
of
the
altar
of
the
lord
which
our
fathers
made
not
for
burnt
offerings
nor
for
sacrifices
but
it
is
a
witness
between
us
and
you
god
forbid
that
we
should
rebel
against
the
lord
and
turn
this
day
from
following
the
lord
to
build
an
altar
for
burnt
offerings
for
meat
offerings
or
for
sacrifices
beside
the
altar
of
the
lord
our
god
that
is
before
his
tabernacle
and
when
phinehas
the
priest
and
the
princes
of
the
congregation
and
heads
of
the
thousands
of
israel
which
were
with
him
heard
the
words
that
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
and
the
children
of
manasseh
spake
it
pleased
them
and
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
said
unto
the
children
of
reuben
and
to
the
children
of
gad
and
to
the
children
of
manasseh
this
day
we
perceive
that
the
lord
is
among
us
because
ye
have
not
committed
this
trespass
against
the
lord
now
ye
have
delivered
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
phinehas
the
son
of
eleazar
the
priest
and
the
princes
returned
from
the
children
of
reuben
and
from
the
children
of
gad
out
of
the
land
of
gilead
unto
the
land
of
canaan
to
the
children
of
israel
and
brought
them
word
again
and
the
thing
pleased
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
blessed
god
and
did
not
intend
to
go
up
against
them
in
battle
to
destroy
the
land
wherein
the
children
of
reuben
and
gad
dwelt
and
the
children
of
reuben
and
the
children
of
gad
called
the
altar
ed
for
it
shall
be
a
witness
between
us
that
the
lord
is
god
and
it
came
to
pass
a
long
time
after
that
the
lord
had
given
rest
unto
israel
from
all
their
enemies
round
about
that
joshua
waxed
old
and
stricken
in
age
and
joshua
called
for
all
israel
and
for
their
elders
and
for
their
heads
and
for
their
judges
and
for
their
officers
and
said
unto
them
i
am
old
and
stricken
in
age
and
ye
have
seen
all
that
the
lord
your
god
hath
done
unto
all
these
nations
because
of
you
for
the
lord
your
god
is
he
that
hath
fought
for
you
behold
i
have
divided
unto
you
by
lot
these
nations
that
remain
to
be
an
inheritance
for
your
tribes
from
jordan
with
all
the
nations
that
i
have
cut
off
even
unto
the
great
sea
westward
and
the
lord
your
god
he
shall
expel
them
from
before
you
and
drive
them
from
out
of
your
sight
and
ye
shall
possess
their
land
as
the
lord
your
god
hath
promised
unto
you
be
ye
therefore
very
courageous
to
keep
and
to
do
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
that
ye
turn
not
aside
therefrom
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
that
ye
come
not
among
these
nations
these
that
remain
among
you
neither
make
mention
of
the
name
of
their
gods
nor
cause
to
swear
by
them
neither
serve
them
nor
bow
yourselves
unto
them
but
cleave
unto
the
lord
your
god
as
ye
have
done
unto
this
day
for
the
lord
hath
driven
out
from
before
you
great
nations
and
strong
but
as
for
you
no
man
hath
been
able
to
stand
before
you
unto
this
day
one
man
of
you
shall
chase
a
thousand
for
the
lord
your
god
he
it
is
that
fighteth
for
you
as
he
hath
promised
you
take
good
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
that
ye
love
the
lord
your
god
else
if
ye
do
in
any
wise
go
back
and
cleave
unto
the
remnant
of
these
nations
even
these
that
remain
among
you
and
shall
make
marriages
with
them
and
go
in
unto
them
and
they
to
you
know
for
a
certainty
that
the
lord
your
god
will
no
more
drive
out
any
of
these
nations
from
before
you
but
they
shall
be
snares
and
traps
unto
you
and
scourges
in
your
sides
and
thorns
in
your
eyes
until
ye
perish
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
and
behold
this
day
i
am
going
the
way
of
all
the
earth
and
ye
know
in
all
your
hearts
and
in
all
your
souls
that
not
one
thing
hath
failed
of
all
the
good
things
which
the
lord
your
god
spake
concerning
you
all
are
come
to
pass
unto
you
and
not
one
thing
hath
failed
thereof
therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
as
all
good
things
are
come
upon
you
which
the
lord
your
god
promised
you
so
shall
the
lord
bring
upon
you
all
evil
things
until
he
have
destroyed
you
from
off
this
good
land
which
the
lord
your
god
hath
given
you
when
ye
have
transgressed
the
covenant
of
the
lord
your
god
which
he
commanded
you
and
have
gone
and
served
other
gods
and
bowed
yourselves
to
them
then
shall
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
kindled
against
you
and
ye
shall
perish
quickly
from
off
the
good
land
which
he
hath
given
unto
you
and
joshua
gathered
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
shechem
and
called
for
the
elders
of
israel
and
for
their
heads
and
for
their
judges
and
for
their
officers
and
they
presented
themselves
before
god
and
joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
your
fathers
dwelt
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
in
old
time
even
terah
the
father
of
abraham
and
the
father
of
nachor
and
they
served
other
gods
and
i
took
your
father
abraham
from
the
other
side
of
the
flood
and
led
him
throughout
all
the
land
of
canaan
and
multiplied
his
seed
and
gave
him
isaac
and
i
gave
unto
isaac
jacob
and
esau
and
i
gave
unto
esau
mount
seir
to
possess
it
but
jacob
and
his
children
went
down
into
egypt
i
sent
moses
also
and
aaron
and
i
plagued
egypt
according
to
that
which
i
did
among
them
and
afterward
i
brought
you
out
and
i
brought
your
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
ye
came
unto
the
sea
and
the
egyptians
pursued
after
your
fathers
with
chariots
and
horsemen
unto
the
red
sea
and
when
they
cried
unto
the
lord
he
put
darkness
between
you
and
the
egyptians
and
brought
the
sea
upon
them
and
covered
them
and
your
eyes
have
seen
what
i
have
done
in
egypt
and
ye
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
a
long
season
and
i
brought
you
into
the
land
of
the
amorites
which
dwelt
on
the
other
side
jordan
and
they
fought
with
you
and
i
gave
them
into
your
hand
that
ye
might
possess
their
land
and
i
destroyed
them
from
before
you
then
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
arose
and
warred
against
israel
and
sent
and
called
balaam
the
son
of
beor
to
curse
you
but
i
would
not
hearken
unto
balaam
therefore
he
blessed
you
still
so
i
delivered
you
out
of
his
hand
and
you
went
over
jordan
and
came
unto
jericho
and
the
men
of
jericho
fought
against
you
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
hittites
and
the
girgashites
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
and
i
delivered
them
into
your
hand
and
i
sent
the
hornet
before
you
which
drave
them
out
from
before
you
even
the
two
kings
of
the
amorites
but
not
with
thy
sword
nor
with
thy
bow
and
i
have
given
you
a
land
for
which
ye
did
not
labour
and
cities
which
ye
built
not
and
ye
dwell
in
them
of
the
vineyards
and
oliveyards
which
ye
planted
not
do
ye
eat
now
therefore
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
in
sincerity
and
in
truth
and
put
away
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
and
in
egypt
and
serve
ye
the
lord
and
if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the
lord
choose
you
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve
whether
the
gods
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
or
the
gods
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
and
the
people
answered
and
said
god
forbid
that
we
should
forsake
the
lord
to
serve
other
gods
for
the
lord
our
god
he
it
is
that
brought
us
up
and
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
and
which
did
those
great
signs
in
our
sight
and
preserved
us
in
all
the
way
wherein
we
went
and
among
all
the
people
through
whom
we
passed
and
the
lord
drave
out
from
before
us
all
the
people
even
the
amorites
which
dwelt
in
the
land
therefore
will
we
also
serve
the
lord
for
he
is
our
god
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
ye
cannot
serve
the
lord
for
he
is
an
holy
god
he
is
a
jealous
god
he
will
not
forgive
your
transgressions
nor
your
sins
if
ye
forsake
the
lord
and
serve
strange
gods
then
he
will
turn
and
do
you
hurt
and
consume
you
after
that
he
hath
done
you
good
and
the
people
said
unto
joshua
nay
but
we
will
serve
the
lord
and
joshua
said
unto
the
people
ye
are
witnesses
against
yourselves
that
ye
have
chosen
you
the
lord
to
serve
him
and
they
said
we
are
witnesses
now
therefore
put
away
said
he
the
strange
gods
which
are
among
you
and
incline
your
heart
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
the
people
said
unto
joshua
the
lord
our
god
will
we
serve
and
his
voice
will
we
obey
so
joshua
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
that
day
and
set
them
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
in
shechem
and
joshua
wrote
these
words
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
god
and
took
a
great
stone
and
set
it
up
there
under
an
oak
that
was
by
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
and
joshua
said
unto
all
the
people
behold
this
stone
shall
be
a
witness
unto
us
for
it
hath
heard
all
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
us
it
shall
be
therefore
a
witness
unto
you
lest
ye
deny
your
god
so
joshua
let
the
people
depart
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old
and
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
timnathserah
which
is
in
mount
ephraim
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
of
gaash
and
israel
served
the
lord
all
the
days
of
joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
overlived
joshua
and
which
had
known
all
the
works
of
the
lord
that
he
had
done
for
israel
and
the
bones
of
joseph
which
the
children
of
israel
brought
up
out
of
egypt
buried
they
in
shechem
in
a
parcel
of
ground
which
jacob
bought
of
the
sons
of
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
for
an
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
it
became
the
inheritance
of
the
children
of
joseph
and
eleazar
the
son
of
aaron
died
and
they
buried
him
in
a
hill
that
pertained
to
phinehas
his
son
which
was
given
him
in
mount
ephraim
the
book
of
judges
now
after
the
death
of
joshua
it
came
to
pass
that
the
children
of
israel
asked
the
lord
saying
who
shall
go
up
for
us
against
the
canaanites
first
to
fight
against
them
and
the
lord
said
judah
shall
go
up
behold
i
have
delivered
the
land
into
his
hand
and
judah
said
unto
simeon
his
brother
come
up
with
me
into
my
lot
that
we
may
fight
against
the
canaanites
and
i
likewise
will
go
with
thee
into
thy
lot
so
simeon
went
with
him
and
judah
went
up
and
the
lord
delivered
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
into
their
hand
and
they
slew
of
them
in
bezek
ten
thousand
men
and
they
found
adonibezek
in
bezek
and
they
fought
against
him
and
they
slew
the
canaanites
and
the
perizzites
but
adonibezek
fled
and
they
pursued
after
him
and
caught
him
and
cut
off
his
thumbs
and
his
great
toes
and
adonibezek
said
threescore
and
ten
kings
having
their
thumbs
and
their
great
toes
cut
off
gathered
their
meat
under
my
table
as
i
have
done
so
god
hath
requited
me
and
they
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
there
he
died
now
the
children
of
judah
had
fought
against
jerusalem
and
had
taken
it
and
smitten
it
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
set
the
city
on
fire
and
afterward
the
children
of
judah
went
down
to
fight
against
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
the
mountain
and
in
the
south
and
in
the
valley
and
judah
went
against
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
hebron
now
the
name
of
hebron
before
was
kirjatharba
and
they
slew
sheshai
and
ahiman
and
talmai
and
from
thence
he
went
against
the
inhabitants
of
debir
and
the
name
of
debir
before
was
kirjathsepher
and
caleb
said
he
that
smiteth
kirjathsepher
and
taketh
it
to
him
will
i
give
achsah
my
daughter
to
wife
and
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
caleb's
younger
brother
took
it
and
he
gave
him
achsah
his
daughter
to
wife
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
came
to
him
that
she
moved
him
to
ask
of
her
father
a
field
and
she
lighted
from
off
her
ass
and
caleb
said
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
and
she
said
unto
him
give
me
a
blessing
for
thou
hast
given
me
a
south
land
give
me
also
springs
of
water
and
caleb
gave
her
the
upper
springs
and
the
nether
springs
and
the
children
of
the
kenite
moses
father
in
law
went
up
out
of
the
city
of
palm
trees
with
the
children
of
judah
into
the
wilderness
of
judah
which
lieth
in
the
south
of
arad
and
they
went
and
dwelt
among
the
people
and
judah
went
with
simeon
his
brother
and
they
slew
the
canaanites
that
inhabited
zephath
and
utterly
destroyed
it
and
the
name
of
the
city
was
called
hormah
also
judah
took
gaza
with
the
coast
thereof
and
askelon
with
the
coast
thereof
and
ekron
with
the
coast
thereof
and
the
lord
was
with
judah
and
he
drave
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountain
but
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
because
they
had
chariots
of
iron
and
they
gave
hebron
unto
caleb
as
moses
said
and
he
expelled
thence
the
three
sons
of
anak
and
the
children
of
benjamin
did
not
drive
out
the
jebusites
that
inhabited
jerusalem
but
the
jebusites
dwell
with
the
children
of
benjamin
in
jerusalem
unto
this
day
and
the
house
of
joseph
they
also
went
up
against
bethel
and
the
lord
was
with
them
and
the
house
of
joseph
sent
to
descry
bethel
now
the
name
of
the
city
before
was
luz
and
the
spies
saw
a
man
come
forth
out
of
the
city
and
they
said
unto
him
shew
us
we
pray
thee
the
entrance
into
the
city
and
we
will
shew
thee
mercy
and
when
he
shewed
them
the
entrance
into
the
city
they
smote
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
they
let
go
the
man
and
all
his
family
and
the
man
went
into
the
land
of
the
hittites
and
built
a
city
and
called
the
name
thereof
luz
which
is
the
name
thereof
unto
this
day
neither
did
manasseh
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
bethshean
and
her
towns
nor
taanach
and
her
towns
nor
the
inhabitants
of
dor
and
her
towns
nor
the
inhabitants
of
ibleam
and
her
towns
nor
the
inhabitants
of
megiddo
and
her
towns
but
the
canaanites
would
dwell
in
that
land
and
it
came
to
pass
when
israel
was
strong
that
they
put
the
canaanites
to
tribute
and
did
not
utterly
drive
them
out
neither
did
ephraim
drive
out
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
gezer
but
the
canaanites
dwelt
in
gezer
among
them
neither
did
zebulun
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
kitron
nor
the
inhabitants
of
nahalol
but
the
canaanites
dwelt
among
them
and
became
tributaries
neither
did
asher
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
accho
nor
the
inhabitants
of
zidon
nor
of
ahlab
nor
of
achzib
nor
of
helbah
nor
of
aphik
nor
of
rehob
but
the
asherites
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
for
they
did
not
drive
them
out
neither
did
naphtali
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
bethshemesh
nor
the
inhabitants
of
bethanath
but
he
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
nevertheless
the
inhabitants
of
bethshemesh
and
of
bethanath
became
tributaries
unto
them
and
the
amorites
forced
the
children
of
dan
into
the
mountain
for
they
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
down
to
the
valley
but
the
amorites
would
dwell
in
mount
heres
in
aijalon
and
in
shaalbim
yet
the
hand
of
the
house
of
joseph
prevailed
so
that
they
became
tributaries
and
the
coast
of
the
amorites
was
from
the
going
up
to
akrabbim
from
the
rock
and
upward
and
an
angel
of
the
lord
came
up
from
gilgal
to
bochim
and
said
i
made
you
to
go
up
out
of
egypt
and
have
brought
you
unto
the
land
which
i
sware
unto
your
fathers
and
i
said
i
will
never
break
my
covenant
with
you
and
ye
shall
make
no
league
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
ye
shall
throw
down
their
altars
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
why
have
ye
done
this
wherefore
i
also
said
i
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
you
but
they
shall
be
as
thorns
in
your
sides
and
their
gods
shall
be
a
snare
unto
you
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
these
words
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
that
the
people
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
bochim
and
they
sacrificed
there
unto
the
lord
and
when
joshua
had
let
the
people
go
the
children
of
israel
went
every
man
unto
his
inheritance
to
possess
the
land
and
the
people
served
the
lord
all
the
days
of
joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
that
outlived
joshua
who
had
seen
all
the
great
works
of
the
lord
that
he
did
for
israel
and
joshua
the
son
of
nun
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
being
an
hundred
and
ten
years
old
and
they
buried
him
in
the
border
of
his
inheritance
in
timnathheres
in
the
mount
of
ephraim
on
the
north
side
of
the
hill
gaash
and
also
all
that
generation
were
gathered
unto
their
fathers
and
there
arose
another
generation
after
them
which
knew
not
the
lord
nor
yet
the
works
which
he
had
done
for
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
served
baalim
and
they
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
of
the
gods
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
and
provoked
the
lord
to
anger
and
they
forsook
the
lord
and
served
baal
and
ashtaroth
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
them
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
round
about
so
that
they
could
not
any
longer
stand
before
their
enemies
whithersoever
they
went
out
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
for
evil
as
the
lord
had
said
and
as
the
lord
had
sworn
unto
them
and
they
were
greatly
distressed
nevertheless
the
lord
raised
up
judges
which
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
those
that
spoiled
them
and
yet
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
judges
but
they
went
a
whoring
after
other
gods
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
they
turned
quickly
out
of
the
way
which
their
fathers
walked
in
obeying
the
commandments
of
the
lord
but
they
did
not
so
and
when
the
lord
raised
them
up
judges
then
the
lord
was
with
the
judge
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
judge
for
it
repented
the
lord
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
judge
was
dead
that
they
returned
and
corrupted
themselves
more
than
their
fathers
in
following
other
gods
to
serve
them
and
to
bow
down
unto
them
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
doings
nor
from
their
stubborn
way
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
said
because
that
this
people
hath
transgressed
my
covenant
which
i
commanded
their
fathers
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
my
voice
i
also
will
not
henceforth
drive
out
any
from
before
them
of
the
nations
which
joshua
left
when
he
died
that
through
them
i
may
prove
israel
whether
they
will
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
to
walk
therein
as
their
fathers
did
keep
it
or
not
therefore
the
lord
left
those
nations
without
driving
them
out
hastily
neither
delivered
he
them
into
the
hand
of
joshua
now
these
are
the
nations
which
the
lord
left
to
prove
israel
by
them
even
as
many
of
israel
as
had
not
known
all
the
wars
of
canaan
only
that
the
generations
of
the
children
of
israel
might
know
to
teach
them
war
at
the
least
such
as
before
knew
nothing
thereof
namely
five
lords
of
the
philistines
and
all
the
canaanites
and
the
sidonians
and
the
hivites
that
dwelt
in
mount
lebanon
from
mount
baalhermon
unto
the
entering
in
of
hamath
and
they
were
to
prove
israel
by
them
to
know
whether
they
would
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
which
he
commanded
their
fathers
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
the
children
of
israel
dwelt
among
the
canaanites
hittites
and
amorites
and
perizzites
and
hivites
and
jebusites
and
they
took
their
daughters
to
be
their
wives
and
gave
their
daughters
to
their
sons
and
served
their
gods
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
forgat
the
lord
their
god
and
served
baalim
and
the
groves
therefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
chushanrishathaim
king
of
mesopotamia
and
the
children
of
israel
served
chushanrishathaim
eight
years
and
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
the
lord
raised
up
a
deliverer
to
the
children
of
israel
who
delivered
them
even
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
caleb's
younger
brother
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
he
judged
israel
and
went
out
to
war
and
the
lord
delivered
chushanrishathaim
king
of
mesopotamia
into
his
hand
and
his
hand
prevailed
against
chushanrishathaim
and
the
land
had
rest
forty
years
and
othniel
the
son
of
kenaz
died
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
strengthened
eglon
the
king
of
moab
against
israel
because
they
had
done
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
he
gathered
unto
him
the
children
of
ammon
and
amalek
and
went
and
smote
israel
and
possessed
the
city
of
palm
trees
so
the
children
of
israel
served
eglon
the
king
of
moab
eighteen
years
but
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
the
lord
raised
them
up
a
deliverer
ehud
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
a
man
lefthanded
and
by
him
the
children
of
israel
sent
a
present
unto
eglon
the
king
of
moab
but
ehud
made
him
a
dagger
which
had
two
edges
of
a
cubit
length
and
he
did
gird
it
under
his
raiment
upon
his
right
thigh
and
he
brought
the
present
unto
eglon
king
of
moab
and
eglon
was
a
very
fat
man
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
to
offer
the
present
he
sent
away
the
people
that
bare
the
present
but
he
himself
turned
again
from
the
quarries
that
were
by
gilgal
and
said
i
have
a
secret
errand
unto
thee
o
king
who
said
keep
silence
and
all
that
stood
by
him
went
out
from
him
and
ehud
came
unto
him
and
he
was
sitting
in
a
summer
parlour
which
he
had
for
himself
alone
and
ehud
said
i
have
a
message
from
god
unto
thee
and
he
arose
out
of
his
seat
and
ehud
put
forth
his
left
hand
and
took
the
dagger
from
his
right
thigh
and
thrust
it
into
his
belly
and
the
haft
also
went
in
after
the
blade
and
the
fat
closed
upon
the
blade
so
that
he
could
not
draw
the
dagger
out
of
his
belly
and
the
dirt
came
out
then
ehud
went
forth
through
the
porch
and
shut
the
doors
of
the
parlour
upon
him
and
locked
them
when
he
was
gone
out
his
servants
came
and
when
they
saw
that
behold
the
doors
of
the
parlour
were
locked
they
said
surely
he
covereth
his
feet
in
his
summer
chamber
and
they
tarried
till
they
were
ashamed
and
behold
he
opened
not
the
doors
of
the
parlour
therefore
they
took
a
key
and
opened
them
and
behold
their
lord
was
fallen
down
dead
on
the
earth
and
ehud
escaped
while
they
tarried
and
passed
beyond
the
quarries
and
escaped
unto
seirath
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
that
he
blew
a
trumpet
in
the
mountain
of
ephraim
and
the
children
of
israel
went
down
with
him
from
the
mount
and
he
before
them
and
he
said
unto
them
follow
after
me
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
your
enemies
the
moabites
into
your
hand
and
they
went
down
after
him
and
took
the
fords
of
jordan
toward
moab
and
suffered
not
a
man
to
pass
over
and
they
slew
of
moab
at
that
time
about
ten
thousand
men
all
lusty
and
all
men
of
valour
and
there
escaped
not
a
man
so
moab
was
subdued
that
day
under
the
hand
of
israel
and
the
land
had
rest
fourscore
years
and
after
him
was
shamgar
the
son
of
anath
which
slew
of
the
philistines
six
hundred
men
with
an
ox
goad
and
he
also
delivered
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
again
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
when
ehud
was
dead
and
the
lord
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
jabin
king
of
canaan
that
reigned
in
hazor
the
captain
of
whose
host
was
sisera
which
dwelt
in
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
for
he
had
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron
and
twenty
years
he
mightily
oppressed
the
children
of
israel
and
deborah
a
prophetess
the
wife
of
lapidoth
she
judged
israel
at
that
time
and
she
dwelt
under
the
palm
tree
of
deborah
between
ramah
and
bethel
in
mount
ephraim
and
the
children
of
israel
came
up
to
her
for
judgment
and
she
sent
and
called
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
out
of
kedeshnaphtali
and
said
unto
him
hath
not
the
lord
god
of
israel
commanded
saying
go
and
draw
toward
mount
tabor
and
take
with
thee
ten
thousand
men
of
the
children
of
naphtali
and
of
the
children
of
zebulun
and
i
will
draw
unto
thee
to
the
river
kishon
sisera
the
captain
of
jabin's
army
with
his
chariots
and
his
multitude
and
i
will
deliver
him
into
thine
hand
and
barak
said
unto
her
if
thou
wilt
go
with
me
then
i
will
go
but
if
thou
wilt
not
go
with
me
then
i
will
not
go
and
she
said
i
will
surely
go
with
thee
notwithstanding
the
journey
that
thou
takest
shall
not
be
for
thine
honour
for
the
lord
shall
sell
sisera
into
the
hand
of
a
woman
and
deborah
arose
and
went
with
barak
to
kedesh
and
barak
called
zebulun
and
naphtali
to
kedesh
and
he
went
up
with
ten
thousand
men
at
his
feet
and
deborah
went
up
with
him
now
heber
the
kenite
which
was
of
the
children
of
hobab
the
father
in
law
of
moses
had
severed
himself
from
the
kenites
and
pitched
his
tent
unto
the
plain
of
zaanaim
which
is
by
kedesh
and
they
shewed
sisera
that
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
was
gone
up
to
mount
tabor
and
sisera
gathered
together
all
his
chariots
even
nine
hundred
chariots
of
iron
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
unto
the
river
of
kishon
and
deborah
said
unto
barak
up
for
this
is
the
day
in
which
the
lord
hath
delivered
sisera
into
thine
hand
is
not
the
lord
gone
out
before
thee
so
barak
went
down
from
mount
tabor
and
ten
thousand
men
after
him
and
the
lord
discomfited
sisera
and
all
his
chariots
and
all
his
host
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
before
barak
so
that
sisera
lighted
down
off
his
chariot
and
fled
away
on
his
feet
but
barak
pursued
after
the
chariots
and
after
the
host
unto
harosheth
of
the
gentiles
and
all
the
host
of
sisera
fell
upon
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
there
was
not
a
man
left
howbeit
sisera
fled
away
on
his
feet
to
the
tent
of
jael
the
wife
of
heber
the
kenite
for
there
was
peace
between
jabin
the
king
of
hazor
and
the
house
of
heber
the
kenite
and
jael
went
out
to
meet
sisera
and
said
unto
him
turn
in
my
lord
turn
in
to
me
fear
not
and
when
he
had
turned
in
unto
her
into
the
tent
she
covered
him
with
a
mantle
and
he
said
unto
her
give
me
i
pray
thee
a
little
water
to
drink
for
i
am
thirsty
and
she
opened
a
bottle
of
milk
and
gave
him
drink
and
covered
him
again
he
said
unto
her
stand
in
the
door
of
the
tent
and
it
shall
be
when
any
man
doth
come
and
enquire
of
thee
and
say
is
there
any
man
here
that
thou
shalt
say
no
then
jael
heber's
wife
took
a
nail
of
the
tent
and
took
an
hammer
in
her
hand
and
went
softly
unto
him
and
smote
the
nail
into
his
temples
and
fastened
it
into
the
ground
for
he
was
fast
asleep
and
weary
so
he
died
and
behold
as
barak
pursued
sisera
jael
came
out
to
meet
him
and
said
unto
him
come
and
i
will
shew
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
and
when
he
came
into
her
tent
behold
sisera
lay
dead
and
the
nail
was
in
his
temples
so
god
subdued
on
that
day
jabin
the
king
of
canaan
before
the
children
of
israel
and
the
hand
of
the
children
of
israel
prospered
and
prevailed
against
jabin
the
king
of
canaan
until
they
had
destroyed
jabin
king
of
canaan
then
sang
deborah
and
barak
the
son
of
abinoam
on
that
day
saying
praise
ye
the
lord
for
the
avenging
of

had
sown
that
the
midianites
came
up
and
the
amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
even
they
came
up
against
them
and
they
encamped
against
them
and
destroyed
the
increase
of
the
earth
till
thou
come
unto
gaza
and
left
no
sustenance
for
israel
neither
sheep
nor
ox
nor
ass
for
they
came
up
with
their
cattle
and
their
tents
and
they
came
as
grasshoppers
for
multitude
for
both
they
and
their
camels
were
without
number
and
they
entered
into
the
land
to
destroy
it
and
israel
was
greatly
impoverished
because
of
the
midianites
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
because
of
the
midianites
that
the
lord
sent
a
prophet
unto
the
children
of
israel
which
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
brought
you
up
from
egypt
and
brought
you
forth
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
and
i
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
that
oppressed
you
and
drave
them
out
from
before
you
and
gave
you
their
land
and
i
said
unto
you
i
am
the
lord
your
god
fear
not
the
gods
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
ye
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
and
there
came
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
sat
under
an
oak
which
was
in
ophrah
that
pertained
unto
joash
the
abiezrite
and
his
son
gideon
threshed
wheat
by
the
winepress
to
hide
it
from
the
midianites
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
the
lord
is
with
thee
thou
mighty
man
of
valour
and
gideon
said
unto
him
oh
my
lord
if
the
lord
be
with
us
why
then
is
all
this
befallen
us
and
where
be
all
his
miracles
which
our
fathers
told
us
of
saying
did
not
the
lord
bring
us
up
from
egypt
but
now
the
lord
hath
forsaken
us
and
delivered
us
into
the
hands
of
the
midianites
and
the
lord
looked
upon
him
and
said
go
in
this
thy
might
and
thou
shalt
save
israel
from
the
hand
of
the
midianites
have
not
i
sent
thee
and
he
said
unto
him
oh
my
lord
wherewith
shall
i
save
israel
behold
my
family
is
poor
in
manasseh
and
i
am
the
least
in
my
father's
house
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
surely
i
will
be
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
midianites
as
one
man
and
he
said
unto
him
if
now
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
then
shew
me
a
sign
that
thou
talkest
with
me
depart
not
hence
i
pray
thee
until
i
come
unto
thee
and
bring
forth
my
present
and
set
it
before
thee
and
he
said
i
will
tarry
until
thou
come
again
and
gideon
went
in
and
made
ready
a
kid
and
unleavened
cakes
of
an
ephah
of
flour
the
flesh
he
put
in
a
basket
and
he
put
the
broth
in
a
pot
and
brought
it
out
unto
him
under
the
oak
and
presented
it
and
the
angel
of
god
said
unto
him
take
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
lay
them
upon
this
rock
and
pour
out
the
broth
and
he
did
so
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
put
forth
the
end
of
the
staff
that
was
in
his
hand
and
touched
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
and
there
rose
up
fire
out
of
the
rock
and
consumed
the
flesh
and
the
unleavened
cakes
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
departed
out
of
his
sight
and
when
gideon
perceived
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
gideon
said
alas
o
lord
god
for
because
i
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
lord
face
to
face
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
peace
be
unto
thee
fear
not
thou
shalt
not
die
then
gideon
built
an
altar
there
unto
the
lord
and
called
it
jehovahshalom
unto
this
day
it
is
yet
in
ophrah
of
the
abiezrites
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
lord
said
unto
him
take
thy
father's
young
bullock
even
the
second
bullock
of
seven
years
old
and
throw
down
the
altar
of
baal
that
thy
father
hath
and
cut
down
the
grove
that
is
by
it
and
build
an
altar
unto
the
lord
thy
god
upon
the
top
of
this
rock
in
the
ordered
place
and
take
the
second
bullock
and
offer
a
burnt
sacrifice
with
the
wood
of
the
grove
which
thou
shalt
cut
down
then
gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
servants
and
did
as
the
lord
had
said
unto
him
and
so
it
was
because
he
feared
his
father's
household
and
the
men
of
the
city
that
he
could
not
do
it
by
day
that
he
did
it
by
night
and
when
the
men
of
the
city
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
the
altar
of
baal
was
cast
down
and
the
grove
was
cut
down
that
was
by
it
and
the
second
bullock
was
offered
upon
the
altar
that
was
built
and
they
said
one
to
another
who
hath
done
this
thing
and
when
they
enquired
and
asked
they
said
gideon
the
son
of
joash
hath
done
this
thing
then
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
joash
bring
out
thy
son
that
he
may
die
because
he
hath
cast
down
the
altar
of
baal
and
because
he
hath
cut
down
the
grove
that
was
by
it
and
joash
said
unto
all
that
stood
against
him
will
ye
plead
for
baal
will
ye
save
him
he
that
will
plead
for
him
let
him
be
put
to
death
whilst
it
is
yet
morning
if
he
be
a
god
let
him
plead
for
himself
because
one
hath
cast
down
his
altar
therefore
on
that
day
he
called
him
jerubbaal
saying
let
baal
plead
against
him
because
he
hath
thrown
down
his
altar
then
all
the
midianites
and
the
amalekites
and
the
children
of
the
east
were
gathered
together
and
went
over
and
pitched
in
the
valley
of
jezreel
but
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
gideon
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
abiezer
was
gathered
after
him
and
he
sent
messengers
throughout
all
manasseh
who
also
was
gathered
after
him
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
asher
and
unto
zebulun
and
unto
naphtali
and
they
came
up
to
meet
them
and
gideon
said
unto
god
if
thou
wilt
save
israel
by
mine
hand
as
thou
hast
said
behold
i
will
put
a
fleece
of
wool
in
the
floor
and
if
the
dew
be
on
the
fleece
only
and
it
be
dry
upon
all
the
earth
beside
then
shall
i
know
that
thou
wilt
save
israel
by
mine
hand
as
thou
hast
said
and
it
was
so
for
he
rose
up
early
on
the
morrow
and
thrust
the
fleece
together
and
wringed
the
dew
out
of
the
fleece
a
bowl
full
of
water
and
gideon
said
unto
god
let
not
thine
anger
be
hot
against
me
and
i
will
speak
but
this
once
let
me
prove
i
pray
thee
but
this
once
with
the
fleece
let
it
now
be
dry
only
upon
the
fleece
and
upon
all
the
ground
let
there
be
dew
and
god
did
so
that
night
for
it
was
dry
upon
the
fleece
only
and
there
was
dew
on
all
the
ground
then
jerubbaal
who
is
gideon
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
rose
up
early
and
pitched
beside
the
well
of
harod
so
that
the
host
of
the
midianites
were
on
the
north
side
of
them
by
the
hill
of
moreh
in
the
valley
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
the
people
that
are
with
thee
are
too
many
for
me
to
give
the
midianites
into
their
hands
lest
israel
vaunt
themselves
against
me
saying
mine
own
hand
hath
saved
me
now
therefore
go
to
proclaim
in
the
ears
of
the
people
saying
whosoever
is
fearful
and
afraid
let
him
return
and
depart
early
from
mount
gilead
and
there
returned
of
the
people
twenty
and
two
thousand
and
there
remained
ten
thousand
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
the
people
are
yet
too
many
bring
them
down
unto
the
water
and
i
will
try
them
for
thee
there
and
it
shall
be
that
of
whom
i
say
unto
thee
this
shall
go
with
thee
the
same
shall
go
with
thee
and
of
whomsoever
i
say
unto
thee
this
shall
not
go
with
thee
the
same
shall
not
go
so
he
brought
down
the
people
unto
the
water
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
every
one
that
lappeth
of
the
water
with
his
tongue
as
a
dog
lappeth
him
shalt
thou
set
by
himself
likewise
every
one
that
boweth
down
upon
his
knees
to
drink
and
the
number
of
them
that
lapped
putting
their
hand
to
their
mouth
were
three
hundred
men
but
all
the
rest
of
the
people
bowed
down
upon
their
knees
to
drink
water
and
the
lord
said
unto
gideon
by
the
three
hundred
men
that
lapped
will
i
save
you
and
deliver
the
midianites
into
thine
hand
and
let
all
the
other
people
go
every
man
unto
his
place
so
the
people
took
victuals
in
their
hand
and
their
trumpets
and
he
sent
all
the
rest
of
israel
every
man
unto
his
tent
and
retained
those
three
hundred
men
and
the
host
of
midian
was
beneath
him
in
the
valley
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
get
thee
down
unto
the
host
for
i
have
delivered
it
into
thine
hand
but
if
thou
fear
to
go
down
go
thou
with
phurah
thy
servant
down
to
the
host
and
thou
shalt
hear
what
they
say
and
afterward
shall
thine
hands
be
strengthened
to
go
down
unto
the
host
then
went
he
down
with
phurah
his
servant
unto
the
outside
of
the
armed
men
that
were
in
the
host
and
the
midianites
and
the
amalekites
and
all
the
children
of
the
east
lay
along
in
the
valley
like
grasshoppers
for
multitude
and
their
camels
were
without
number
as
the
sand
by
the
sea
side
for
multitude
and
when
gideon
was
come
behold
there
was
a
man
that
told
a
dream
unto
his
fellow
and
said
behold
i
dreamed
a
dream
and
lo
a
cake
of
barley
bread
tumbled
into
the
host
of
midian
and
came
unto
a
tent
and
smote
it
that
it
fell
and
overturned
it
that
the
tent
lay
along
and
his
fellow
answered
and
said
this
is
nothing
else
save
the
sword
of
gideon
the
son
of
joash
a
man
of
israel
for
into
his
hand
hath
god
delivered
midian
and
all
the
host
and
it
was
so
when
gideon
heard
the
telling
of
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
thereof
that
he
worshipped
and
returned
into
the
host
of
israel
and
said
arise
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
host
of
midian
and
he
divided
the
three
hundred
men
into
three
companies
and
he
put
a
trumpet
in
every
man's
hand
with
empty
pitchers
and
lamps
within
the
pitchers
and
he
said
unto
them
look
on
me
and
do
likewise
and
behold
when
i
come
to
the
outside
of
the
camp
it
shall
be
that
as
i
do
so
shall
ye
do
when
i
blow
with
a
trumpet
i
and
all
that
are
with
me
then
blow
ye
the
trumpets
also
on
every
side
of
all
the
camp
and
say
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
so
gideon
and
the
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
came
unto
the
outside
of
the
camp
in
the
beginning
of
the
middle
watch
and
they
had
but
newly
set
the
watch
and
they
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake
the
pitchers
that
were
in
their
hands
and
the
three
companies
blew
the
trumpets
and
brake
the
pitchers
and
held
the
lamps
in
their
left
hands
and
the
trumpets
in
their
right
hands
to
blow
withal
and
they
cried
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
and
they
stood
every
man
in
his
place
round
about
the
camp
and
all
the
host
ran
and
cried
and
fled
and
the
three
hundred
blew
the
trumpets
and
the
lord
set
every
man's
sword
against
his
fellow
even
throughout
all
the
host
and
the
host
fled
to
bethshittah
in
zererath
and
to
the
border
of
abelmeholah
unto
tabbath
and
the
men
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
naphtali
and
out
of
asher
and
out
of
all
manasseh
and
pursued
after
the
midianites
and
gideon
sent
messengers
throughout
all
mount
ephraim
saying
come
down
against
the
midianites
and
take
before
them
the
waters
unto
bethbarah
and
jordan
then
all
the
men
of
ephraim
gathered
themselves
together
and
took
the
waters
unto
bethbarah
and
jordan
and
they
took
two
princes
of
the
midianites
oreb
and
zeeb
and
they
slew
oreb
upon
the
rock
oreb
and
zeeb
they
slew
at
the
winepress
of
zeeb
and
pursued
midian
and
brought
the
heads
of
oreb
and
zeeb
to
gideon
on
the
other
side
jordan
and
the
men
of
ephraim
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
served
us
thus
that
thou
calledst
us
not
when
thou
wentest
to
fight
with
the
midianites
and
they
did
chide
with
him
sharply
and
he
said
unto
them
what
have
i
done
now
in
comparison
of
you
is
not
the
gleaning
of
the
grapes
of
ephraim
better
than
the
vintage
of
abiezer
god
hath
delivered
into
your
hands
the
princes
of
midian
oreb
and
zeeb
and
what
was
i
able
to
do
in
comparison
of
you
then
their
anger
was
abated
toward
him
when
he
had
said
that
and
gideon
came
to
jordan
and
passed
over
he
and
the
three
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
faint
yet
pursuing
them
and
he
said
unto
the
men
of
succoth
give
i
pray
you
loaves
of
bread
unto
the
people
that
follow
me
for
they
be
faint
and
i
am
pursuing
after
zebah
and
zalmunna
kings
of
midian
and
the
princes
of
succoth
said
are
the
hands
of
zebah
and
zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thine
army
and
gideon
said
therefore
when
the
lord
hath
delivered
zebah
and
zalmunna
into
mine
hand
then
i
will
tear
your
flesh
with
the
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
with
briers
and
he
went
up
thence
to
penuel
and
spake
unto
them
likewise
and
the
men
of
penuel
answered
him
as
the
men
of
succoth
had
answered
him
and
he
spake
also
unto
the
men
of
penuel
saying
when
i
come
again
in
peace
i
will
break
down
this
tower
now
zebah
and
zalmunna
were
in
karkor
and
their
hosts
with
them
about
fifteen
thousand
men
all
that
were
left
of
all
the
hosts
of
the
children
of
the
east
for
there
fell
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
and
gideon
went
up
by
the
way
of
them
that
dwelt
in
tents
on
the
east
of
nobah
and
jogbehah
and
smote
the
host
for
the
host
was
secure
and
when
zebah
and
zalmunna
fled
he
pursued
after
them
and
took
the
two
kings
of
midian
zebah
and
zalmunna
and
discomfited
all
the
host
and
gideon
the
son
of
joash
returned
from
battle
before
the
sun
was
up
and
caught
a
young
man
of
the
men
of
succoth
and
enquired
of
him
and
he
described
unto
him
the
princes
of
succoth
and
the
elders
thereof
even
threescore
and
seventeen
men
and
he
came
unto
the
men
of
succoth
and
said
behold
zebah
and
zalmunna
with
whom
ye
did
upbraid
me
saying
are
the
hands
of
zebah
and
zalmunna
now
in
thine
hand
that
we
should
give
bread
unto
thy
men
that
are
weary
and
he
took
the
elders
of
the
city
and
thorns
of
the
wilderness
and
briers
and
with
them
he
taught
the
men
of
succoth
and
he
beat
down
the
tower
of
penuel
and
slew
the
men
of
the
city
then
said
he
unto
zebah
and
zalmunna
what
manner
of
men
were
they
whom
ye
slew
at
tabor
and
they
answered
as
thou
art
so
were
they
each
one
resembled
the
children
of
a
king
and
he
said
they
were
my
brethren
even
the
sons
of
my
mother
as
the
lord
liveth
if
ye
had
saved
them
alive
i
would
not
slay
you
and
he
said
unto
jether
his
firstborn
up
and
slay
them
but
the
youth
drew
not
his
sword
for
he
feared
because
he
was
yet
a
youth
then
zebah
and
zalmunna
said
rise
thou
and
fall
upon
us
for
as
the
man
is
so
is
his
strength
and
gideon
arose
and
slew
zebah
and
zalmunna
and
took
away
the
ornaments
that
were
on
their
camels
necks
then
the
men
of
israel
said
unto
gideon
rule
thou
over
us
both
thou
and
thy
son
and
thy
son's
son
also
for
thou
hast
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
midian
and
gideon
said
unto
them
i
will
not
rule
over
you
neither
shall
my
son
rule
over
you
the
lord
shall
rule
over
you
and
gideon
said
unto
them
i
would
desire
a
request
of
you
that
ye
would
give
me
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey
for
they
had
golden
earrings
because
they
were
ishmaelites
and
they
answered
we
will
willingly
give
them
and
they
spread
a
garment
and
did
cast
therein
every
man
the
earrings
of
his
prey
and
the
weight
of
the
golden
earrings
that
he
requested
was
a
thousand
and
seven
hundred
shekels
of
gold
beside
ornaments
and
collars
and
purple
raiment
that
was
on
the
kings
of
midian
and
beside
the
chains
that
were
about
their
camels
necks
and
gideon
made
an
ephod
thereof
and
put
it
in
his
city
even
in
ophrah
and
all
israel
went
thither
a
whoring
after
it
which
thing
became
a
snare
unto
gideon
and
to
his
house
thus
was
midian
subdued
before
the
children
of
israel
so
that
they
lifted
up
their
heads
no
more
and
the
country
was
in
quietness
forty
years
in
the
days
of
gideon
and
jerubbaal
the
son
of
joash
went
and
dwelt
in
his
own
house
and
gideon
had
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
his
body
begotten
for
he
had
many
wives
and
his
concubine
that
was
in
shechem
she
also
bare
him
a
son
whose
name
he
called
abimelech
and
gideon
the
son
of
joash
died
in
a
good
old
age
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
joash
his
father
in
ophrah
of
the
abiezrites
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
gideon
was
dead
that
the
children
of
israel
turned
again
and
went
a
whoring
after
baalim
and
made
baalberith
their
god
and
the
children
of
israel
remembered
not
the
lord
their
god
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
all
their
enemies
on
every
side
neither
shewed
they
kindness
to
the
house
of
jerubbaal
namely
gideon
according
to
all
the
goodness
which
he
had
shewed
unto
israel
and
abimelech
the
son
of
jerubbaal
went
to
shechem
unto
his
mother's
brethren
and
communed
with
them
and
with
all
the
family
of
the
house
of
his
mother's
father
saying
speak
i
pray
you
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
shechem
whether
is
better
for
you
either
that
all
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
which
are
threescore
and
ten
persons
reign
over
you
or
that
one
reign
over
you
remember
also
that
i
am
your
bone
and
your
flesh
and
his
mother's
brethren
spake
of
him
in
the
ears
of
all
the
men
of
shechem
all
these
words
and
their
hearts
inclined
to
follow
abimelech
for
they
said
he
is
our
brother
and
they
gave
him
threescore
and
ten
pieces
of
silver
out
of
the
house
of
baalberith
wherewith
abimelech
hired
vain
and
light
persons
which
followed
him
and
he
went
unto
his
father's
house
at
ophrah
and
slew
his
brethren
the
sons
of
jerubbaal
being
threescore
and
ten
persons
upon
one
stone
notwithstanding
yet
jotham
the
youngest
son
of
jerubbaal
was
left
for
he
hid
himself
and
all
the
men
of
shechem
gathered
together
and
all
the
house
of
millo
and
went
and
made
abimelech
king
by
the
plain
of
the
pillar
that
was
in
shechem
and
when
they
told
it
to
jotham
he
went
and
stood
in
the
top
of
mount
gerizim
and
lifted
up
his
voice
and
cried
and
said
unto
them
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
shechem
that
god
may
hearken
unto
you
the
trees
went
forth
on
a
time
to
anoint
a
king
over
them
and
they
said
unto
the
olive
tree
reign
thou
over
us
but
the
olive
tree
said
unto
them
should
i
leave
my
fatness
wherewith
by
me
they
honour
god
and
man
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
and
the
trees
said
to
the
fig
tree
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
but
the
fig
tree
said
unto
them
should
i
forsake
my
sweetness
and
my
good
fruit
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
then
said
the
trees
unto
the
vine
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
and
the
vine
said
unto
them
should
i
leave
my
wine
which
cheereth
god
and
man
and
go
to
be
promoted
over
the
trees
then
said
all
the
trees
unto
the
bramble
come
thou
and
reign
over
us
and
the
bramble
said
unto
the
trees
if
in
truth
ye
anoint
me
king
over
you
then
come
and
put
your
trust
in
my
shadow
and
if
not
let
fire
come
out
of
the
bramble
and
devour
the
cedars
of
lebanon
now
therefore
if
ye
have
done
truly
and
sincerely
in
that
ye
have
made
abimelech
king
and
if
ye
have
dealt
well
with
jerubbaal
and
his
house
and
have
done
unto
him
according
to
the
deserving
of
his
hands
for
my
father
fought
for
you
and
adventured
his
life
far
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
midian
and
ye
are
risen
up
against
my
father's
house
this
day
and
have
slain
his
sons
threescore
and
ten
persons
upon
one
stone
and
have
made
abimelech
the
son
of
his
maidservant
king
over
the
men
of
shechem
because
he
is
your
brother
if
ye
then
have
dealt
truly
and
sincerely
with
jerubbaal
and
with
his
house
this
day
then
rejoice
ye
in
abimelech
and
let
him
also
rejoice
in
you
but
if
not
let
fire
come
out
from
abimelech
and
devour
the
men
of
shechem
and
the
house
of
millo
and
let
fire
come
out
from
the
men
of
shechem
and
from
the
house
of
millo
and
devour
abimelech
and
jotham
ran
away
and
fled
and
went
to
beer
and
dwelt
there
for
fear
of
abimelech
his
brother
when
abimelech
had
reigned
three
years
over
israel
then
god
sent
an
evil
spirit
between
abimelech
and
the
men
of
shechem
and
the
men
of
shechem
dealt
treacherously
with
abimelech
that
the
cruelty
done
to
the
threescore
and
ten
sons
of
jerubbaal
might
come
and
their
blood
be
laid
upon
abimelech
their
brother
which
slew
them
and
upon
the
men
of
shechem
which
aided
him
in
the
killing
of
his
brethren
and
the
men
of
shechem
set
liers
in
wait
for
him
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
they
robbed
all
that
came
along
that
way
by
them
and
it
was
told
abimelech
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
came
with
his
brethren
and
went
over
to
shechem
and
the
men
of
shechem
put
their
confidence
in
him
and
they
went
out
into
the
fields
and
gathered
their
vineyards
and
trode
the
grapes
and
made
merry
and
went
into
the
house
of
their
god
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
cursed
abimelech
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
said
who
is
abimelech
and
who
is
shechem
that
we
should
serve
him
is
not
he
the
son
of
jerubbaal
and
zebul
his
officer
serve
the
men
of
hamor
the
father
of
shechem
for
why
should
we
serve
him
and
would
to
god
this
people
were
under
my
hand
then
would
i
remove
abimelech
and
he
said
to
abimelech
increase
thine
army
and
come
out
and
when
zebul
the
ruler
of
the
city
heard
the
words
of
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
his
anger
was
kindled
and
he
sent
messengers
unto
abimelech
privily
saying
behold
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
and
his
brethren
be
come
to
shechem
and
behold
they
fortify
the
city
against
thee
now
therefore
up
by
night
thou
and
the
people
that
is
with
thee
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
field
and
it
shall
be
that
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
up
thou
shalt
rise
early
and
set
upon
the
city
and
behold
when
he
and
the
people
that
is
with
him
come
out
against
thee
then
mayest
thou
do
to
them
as
thou
shalt
find
occasion
and
abimelech
rose
up
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
by
night
and
they
laid
wait
against
shechem
in
four
companies
and
gaal
the
son
of
ebed
went
out
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
abimelech
rose
up
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
lying
in
wait
and
when
gaal
saw
the
people
he
said
to
zebul
behold
there
come
people
down
from
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
zebul
said
unto
him
thou
seest
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
men
and
gaal
spake
again
and
said
see
there
come
people
down
by
the
middle
of
the
land
and
another
company
come
along
by
the
plain
of
meonenim
then
said
zebul
unto
him
where
is
now
thy
mouth
wherewith
thou
saidst
who
is
abimelech
that
we
should
serve
him
is
not
this
the
people
that
thou
hast
despised
go
out
i
pray
now
and
fight
with
them
and
gaal
went
out
before
the
men
of
shechem
and
fought
with
abimelech
and
abimelech
chased
him
and
he
fled
before
him
and
many
were
overthrown
and
wounded
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate
and
abimelech
dwelt
at
arumah
and
zebul
thrust
out
gaal
and
his
brethren
that
they
should
not
dwell
in
shechem
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
and
they
told
abimelech
and
he
took
the
people
and
divided
them
into
three
companies
and
laid
wait
in
the
field
and
looked
and
behold
the
people
were
come
forth
out
of
the
city
and
he
rose
up
against
them
and
smote
them
and
abimelech
and
the
company
that
was
with
him
rushed
forward
and
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
two
other
companies
ran
upon
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
fields
and
slew
them
and
abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
day
and
he
took
the
city
and
slew
the
people
that
was
therein
and
beat
down
the
city
and
sowed
it
with
salt
and
when
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
heard
that
they
entered
into
an
hold
of
the
house
of
the
god
berith
and
it
was
told
abimelech
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
were
gathered
together
and
abimelech
gat
him
up
to
mount
zalmon
he
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
abimelech
took
an
axe
in
his
hand
and
cut
down
a
bough
from
the
trees
and
took
it
and
laid
it
on
his
shoulder
and
said
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
what
ye
have
seen
me
do
make
haste
and
do
as
i
have
done
and
all
the
people
likewise
cut
down
every
man
his
bough
and
followed
abimelech
and
put
them
to
the
hold
and
set
the
hold
on
fire
upon
them
so
that
all
the
men
of
the
tower
of
shechem
died
also
about
a
thousand
men
and
women
then
went
abimelech
to
thebez
and
encamped
against
thebez
and
took
it
but
there
was
a
strong
tower
within
the
city
and
thither
fled
all
the
men
and
women
and
all
they
of
the
city
and
shut
it
to
them
and
gat
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
abimelech
came
unto
the
tower
and
fought
against
it
and
went
hard
unto
the
door
of
the
tower
to
burn
it
with
fire
and
a
certain
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
abimelech's
head
and
all
to
brake
his
skull
then
he
called
hastily
unto
the
young
man
his
armourbearer
and
said
unto
him
draw
thy
sword
and
slay
me
that
men
say
not
of
me
a
women
slew
him
and
his
young
man
thrust
him
through
and
he
died
and
when
the
men
of
israel
saw
that
abimelech
was
dead
they
departed
every
man
unto
his
place
thus
god
rendered
the
wickedness
of
abimelech
which
he
did
unto
his
father
in
slaying
his
seventy
brethren
and
all
the
evil
of
the
men
of
shechem
did
god
render
upon
their
heads
and
upon
them
came
the
curse
of
jotham
the
son
of
jerubbaal
and
after
abimelech
there
arose
to
defend
israel
tola
the
son
of
puah
the
son
of
dodo
a
man
of
issachar
and
he
dwelt
in
shamir
in
mount
ephraim
and
he
judged
israel
twenty
and
three
years
and
died
and
was
buried
in
shamir
and
after
him
arose
jair
a
gileadite
and
judged
israel
twenty
and
two
years
and
he
had
thirty
sons
that
rode
on
thirty
ass
colts
and
they
had
thirty
cities
which
are
called
havothjair
unto
this
day
which
are
in
the
land
of
gilead
and
jair
died
and
was
buried
in
camon
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
the
gods
of
syria
and
the
gods
of
zidon
and
the
gods
of
moab
and
the
gods
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
gods
of
the
philistines
and
forsook
the
lord
and
served
not
him
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
into
the
hands
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
that
year
they
vexed
and
oppressed
the
children
of
israel
eighteen
years
all
the
children
of
israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
in
the
land
of
the
amorites
which
is
in
gilead
moreover
the
children
of
ammon
passed
over
jordan
to
fight
also
against
judah
and
against
benjamin
and
against
the
house
of
ephraim
so
that
israel
was
sore
distressed
and
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
we
have
sinned
against
thee
both
because
we
have
forsaken
our
god
and
also
served
baalim
and
the
lord
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
did
not
i
deliver
you
from
the
egyptians
and
from
the
amorites
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
from
the
philistines
the
zidonians
also
and
the
amalekites
and
the
maonites
did
oppress
you
and
ye
cried
to
me
and
i
delivered
you
out
of
their
hand
yet
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
wherefore
i
will
deliver
you
no
more
go
and
cry
unto
the
gods
which
ye
have
chosen
let
them
deliver
you
in
the
time
of
your
tribulation
and
the
children
of
israel
said
unto
the
lord
we
have
sinned
do
thou
unto
us
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee
deliver
us
only
we
pray
thee
this
day
and
they
put
away
the
strange
gods
from
among
them
and
served
the
lord
and
his
soul
was
grieved
for
the
misery
of
israel
then
the
children
of
ammon
were
gathered
together
and
encamped
in
gilead
and
the
children
of
israel
assembled
themselves
together
and
encamped
in
mizpeh
and
the
people
and
princes
of
gilead
said
one
to
another
what
man
is
he
that
will
begin
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
he
shall
be
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
now
jephthah
the
gileadite
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
he
was
the
son
of
an
harlot
and
gilead
begat
jephthah
and
gilead's
wife
bare
him
sons
and
his
wife's
sons
grew
up
and
they
thrust
out
jephthah
and
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
inherit
in
our
father's
house
for
thou
art
the
son
of
a
strange
woman
then
jephthah
fled
from
his
brethren
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
tob
and
there
were
gathered
vain
men
to
jephthah
and
went
out
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
in
process
of
time
that
the
children
of
ammon
made
war
against
israel
and
it
was
so
that
when
the
children
of
ammon
made
war
against
israel
the
elders
of
gilead
went
to
fetch
jephthah
out
of
the
land
of
tob
and
they
said
unto
jephthah
come
and
be
our
captain
that
we
may
fight
with
the
children
of
ammon
and
jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
gilead
did
not
ye
hate
me
and
expel
me
out
of
my
father's
house
and
why
are
ye
come
unto
me
now
when
ye
are
in
distress
and
the
elders
of
gilead
said
unto
jephthah
therefore
we
turn
again
to
thee
now
that
thou
mayest
go
with
us
and
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
be
our
head
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
and
jephthah
said
unto
the
elders
of
gilead
if
ye
bring
me
home
again
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
lord
deliver
them
before
me
shall
i
be
your
head
and
the
elders
of
gilead
said
unto
jephthah
the
lord
be
witness
between
us
if
we
do
not
so
according
to
thy
words
then
jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
gilead
and
the
people
made
him
head
and
captain
over
them
and
jephthah
uttered
all
his
words
before
the
lord
in
mizpeh
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
saying
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
me
that
thou
art
come
against
me
to
fight
in
my
land
and
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
answered
unto
the
messengers
of
jephthah
because
israel
took
away
my
land
when
they
came
up
out
of
egypt
from
arnon
even
unto
jabbok
and
unto
jordan
now
therefore
restore
those
lands
again
peaceably
and
jephthah
sent
messengers
again
unto
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
jephthah
israel
took
not
away
the
land
of
moab
nor
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
but
when
israel
came
up
from
egypt
and
walked
through
the
wilderness
unto
the
red
sea
and
came
to
kadesh
then
israel
sent
messengers
unto
the
king
of
edom
saying
let
me
i
pray
thee
pass
through
thy
land
but
the
king
of
edom
would
not
hearken
thereto
and
in
like
manner
they
sent
unto
the
king
of
moab
but
he
would
not
consent
and
israel
abode
in
kadesh
then
they
went
along
through
the
wilderness
and
compassed
the
land
of
edom
and
the
land
of
moab
and
came
by
the
east
side
of
the
land
of
moab
and
pitched
on
the
other
side
of
arnon
but
came
not
within
the
border
of
moab
for
arnon
was
the
border
of
moab
and
israel
sent
messengers
unto
sihon
king
of
the
amorites
the
king
of
heshbon
and
israel
said
unto
him
let
us
pass
we
pray
thee
through
thy
land
into
my
place
but
sihon
trusted
not
israel
to
pass
through
his
coast
but
sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
pitched
in
jahaz
and
fought
against
israel
and
the
lord
god
of
israel
delivered
sihon
and
all
his
people
into
the
hand
of
israel
and
they
smote
them
so
israel
possessed
all
the
land
of
the
amorites
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
and
they
possessed
all
the
coasts
of
the
amorites
from
arnon
even
unto
jabbok
and
from
the
wilderness
even
unto
jordan
so
now
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
dispossessed
the
amorites
from
before
his
people
israel
and
shouldest
thou
possess
it
wilt
not
thou
possess
that
which
chemosh
thy
god
giveth
thee
to
possess
so
whomsoever
the
lord
our
god
shall
drive
out
from
before
us
them
will
we
possess
and
now
art
thou
any
thing
better
than
balak
the
son
of
zippor
king
of
moab
did
he
ever
strive
against
israel
or
did
he
ever
fight
against
them
while
israel
dwelt
in
heshbon
and
her
towns
and
in
aroer
and
her
towns
and
in
all
the
cities
that
be
along
by
the
coasts
of
arnon
three
hundred
years
why
therefore
did
ye
not
recover
them
within
that
time
wherefore
i
have
not
sinned
against
thee
but
thou
doest
me
wrong
to
war
against
me
the
lord
the
judge
be
judge
this
day
between
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
ammon
howbeit
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
jephthah
which
he
sent
him
then
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
jephthah
and
he
passed
over
gilead
and
manasseh
and
passed
over
mizpeh
of
gilead
and
from
mizpeh
of
gilead
he
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
and
jephthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
and
said
if
thou
shalt
without
fail
deliver
the
children
of
ammon
into
mine
hands
then
it
shall
be
that
whatsoever
cometh
forth
of
the
doors
of
my
house
to
meet
me
when
i
return
in
peace
from
the
children
of
ammon
shall
surely
be
the
lord's
and
i
will
offer
it
up
for
a
burnt
offering
so
jephthah
passed
over
unto
the
children
of
ammon
to
fight
against
them
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
his
hands
and
he
smote
them
from
aroer
even
till
thou
come
to
minnith
even
twenty
cities
and
unto
the
plain
of
the
vineyards
with
a
very
great
slaughter
thus
the
children
of
ammon
were
subdued
before
the
children
of
israel
and
jephthah
came
to
mizpeh
unto
his
house
and
behold
his
daughter
came
out
to
meet
him
with
timbrels
and
with
dances
and
she
was
his
only
child
beside
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
saw
her
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
said
alas
my
daughter
thou
hast
brought
me
very
low
and
thou
art
one
of
them
that
trouble
me
for
i
have
opened
my
mouth
unto
the
lord
and
i
cannot
go
back
and
she
said
unto
him
my
father
if
thou
hast
opened
thy
mouth
unto
the
lord
do
to
me
according
to
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
thy
mouth
forasmuch
as
the
lord
hath
taken
vengeance
for
thee
of
thine
enemies
even
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
she
said
unto
her
father
let
this
thing
be
done
for
me
let
me
alone
two
months
that
i
may
go
up
and
down
upon
the
mountains
and
bewail
my
virginity
i
and
my
fellows
and
he
said
go
and
he
sent
her
away
for
two
months
and
she
went
with
her
companions
and
bewailed
her
virginity
upon
the
mountains
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
two
months
that
she
returned
unto
her
father
who
did
with
her
according
to
his
vow
which
he
had
vowed
and
she
knew
no
man
and
it
was
a
custom
in
israel
that
the
daughters
of
israel
went
yearly
to
lament
the
daughter
of
jephthah
the
gileadite
four
days
in
a
year
and
the
men
of
ephraim
gathered
themselves
together
and
went
northward
and
said
unto
jephthah
wherefore
passedst
thou
over
to
fight
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
didst
not
call
us
to
go
with
thee
we
will
burn
thine
house
upon
thee
with
fire
and
jephthah
said
unto
them
i
and
my
people
were
at
great
strife
with
the
children
of
ammon
and
when
i
called
you
ye
delivered
me
not
out
of
their
hands
and
when
i
saw
that
ye
delivered
me
not
i
put
my
life
in
my
hands
and
passed
over
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
my
hand
wherefore
then
are
ye
come
up
unto
me
this
day
to
fight
against
me
then
jephthah
gathered
together
all
the
men
of
gilead
and
fought
with
ephraim
and
the
men
of
gilead
smote
ephraim
because
they
said
ye
gileadites
are
fugitives
of
ephraim
among
the
ephraimites
and
among
the
manassites
and
the
gileadites
took
the
passages
of
jordan
before
the
ephraimites
and
it
was
so
that
when
those
ephraimites
which
were
escaped
said
let
me
go
over
that
the
men
of
gilead
said
unto
him
art
thou
an
ephraimite
if
he
said
nay
then
said
they
unto
him
say
now
shibboleth
and
he
said
sibboleth
for
he
could
not
frame
to
pronounce
it
right
then
they
took
him
and
slew
him
at
the
passages
of
jordan
and
there
fell
at
that
time
of
the
ephraimites
forty
and
two
thousand
and
jephthah
judged
israel
six
years
then
died
jephthah
the
gileadite
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
cities
of
gilead
and
after
him
ibzan
of
bethlehem
judged
israel
and
he
had
thirty
sons
and
thirty
daughters
whom
he
sent
abroad
and
took
in
thirty
daughters
from
abroad
for
his
sons
and
he
judged
israel
seven
years
then
died
ibzan
and
was
buried
at
bethlehem
and
after
him
elon
a
zebulonite
judged
israel
and
he
judged
israel
ten
years
and
elon
the
zebulonite
died
and
was
buried
in
aijalon
in
the
country
of
zebulun
and
after
him
abdon
the
son
of
hillel
a
pirathonite
judged
israel
and
he
had
forty
sons
and
thirty
nephews
that
rode
on
threescore
and
ten
ass
colts
and
he
judged
israel
eight
years
and
abdon
the
son
of
hillel
the
pirathonite
died
and
was
buried
in
pirathon
in
the
land
of
ephraim
in
the
mount
of
the
amalekites
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
forty
years
and
there
was
a
certain
man
of
zorah
of
the
family
of
the
danites
whose
name
was
manoah
and
his
wife
was
barren
and
bare
not
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
the
woman
and
said
unto
her
behold
now
thou
art
barren
and
bearest
not
but
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
now
therefore
beware
i
pray
thee
and
drink
not
wine
nor
strong
drink
and
eat
not
any
unclean
thing
for
lo
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
no
razor
shall
come
on
his
head
for
the
child
shall
be
a
nazarite
unto
god
from
the
womb
and
he
shall
begin
to
deliver
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
then
the
woman
came
and
told
her
husband
saying
a
man
of
god
came
unto
me
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
countenance
of
an
angel
of
god
very
terrible
but
i
asked
him
not
whence
he
was
neither
told
he
me
his
name
but
he
said
unto
me
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
now
drink
no
wine
nor
strong
drink
neither
eat
any
unclean
thing
for
the
child
shall
be
a
nazarite
to
god
from
the
womb
to
the
day
of
his
death
then
manoah
intreated
the
lord
and
said
o
my
lord
let
the
man
of
god
which
thou
didst
send
come
again
unto
us
and
teach
us
what
we
shall
do
unto
the
child
that
shall
be
born
and
god
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
manoah
and
the
angel
of
god
came
again
unto
the
woman
as
she
sat
in
the
field
but
manoah
her
husband
was
not
with
her
and
the
woman
made
haste
and
ran
and
shewed
her
husband
and
said
unto
him
behold
the
man
hath
appeared
unto
me
that
came
unto
me
the
other
day
and
manoah
arose
and
went
after
his
wife
and
came
to
the
man
and
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
man
that
spakest
unto
the
woman
and
he
said
i
am
and
manoah
said
now
let
thy
words
come
to
pass
how
shall
we
order
the
child
and
how
shall
we
do
unto
him
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
manoah
of
all
that
i
said
unto
the
woman
let
her
beware
she
may
not
eat
of
any
thing
that
cometh
of
the
vine
neither
let
her
drink
wine
or
strong
drink
nor
eat
any
unclean
thing
all
that
i
commanded
her
let
her
observe
and
manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
i
pray
thee
let
us
detain
thee
until
we
shall
have
made
ready
a
kid
for
thee
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
manoah
though
thou
detain
me
i
will
not
eat
of
thy
bread
and
if
thou
wilt
offer
a
burnt
offering
thou
must
offer
it
unto
the
lord
for
manoah
knew
not
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
manoah
said
unto
the
angel
of
the
lord
what
is
thy
name
that
when
thy
sayings
come
to
pass
we
may
do
thee
honour
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
why
askest
thou
thus
after
my
name
seeing
it
is
secret
so
manoah
took
a
kid
with
a
meat
offering
and
offered
it
upon
a
rock
unto
the
lord
and
the
angel
did
wonderously
and
manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
for
it
came
to
pass
when
the
flame
went
up
toward
heaven
from
off
the
altar
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
ascended
in
the
flame
of
the
altar
and
manoah
and
his
wife
looked
on
it
and
fell
on
their
faces
to
the
ground
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
did
no
more
appear
to
manoah
and
to
his
wife
then
manoah
knew
that
he
was
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
manoah
said
unto
his
wife
we
shall
surely
die
because
we
have
seen
god
but
his
wife
said
unto
him
if
the
lord
were
pleased
to
kill
us
he
would
not
have
received
a
burnt
offering
and
a
meat
offering
at
our
hands
neither
would
he
have
shewed
us
all
these
things
nor
would
as
at
this
time
have
told
us
such
things
as
these
and
the
woman
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
samson
and
the
child
grew
and
the
lord
blessed
him
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
began
to
move
him
at
times
in
the
camp
of
dan
between
zorah
and
eshtaol
and
samson
went
down
to
timnath
and
saw
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
and
he
came
up
and
told
his
father
and
his
mother
and
said
i
have
seen
a
woman
in
timnath
of
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
now
therefore
get
her
for
me
to
wife
then
his
father
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
is
there
never
a
woman
among
the
daughters
of
thy
brethren
or
among
all
my
people
that
thou
goest
to
take
a
wife
of
the
uncircumcised
philistines
and
samson
said
unto
his
father
get
her
for
me
for
she
pleaseth
me
well
but
his
father
and
his
mother
knew
not
that
it
was
of
the
lord
that
he
sought
an
occasion
against
the
philistines
for
at
that
time
the
philistines
had
dominion
over
israel
then
went
samson
down
and
his
father
and
his
mother
to
timnath
and
came
to
the
vineyards
of
timnath
and
behold
a
young
lion
roared
against
him
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
mightily
upon
him
and
he
rent
him
as
he
would
have
rent
a
kid
and
he
had
nothing
in
his
hand
but
he
told
not
his
father
or
his
mother
what
he
had
done
and
he
went
down
and
talked
with
the
woman
and
she
pleased
samson
well
and
after
a
time
he
returned
to
take
her
and
he
turned
aside
to
see
the
carcase
of
the
lion
and
behold
there
was
a
swarm
of
bees
and
honey
in
the
carcase
of
the
lion
and
he
took
thereof
in
his
hands
and
went
on
eating
and
came
to
his
father
and
mother
and
he
gave
them
and
they
did
eat
but
he
told
not
them
that
he
had
taken
the
honey
out
of
the
carcase
of
the
lion
so
his
father
went
down
unto
the
woman
and
samson
made
there
a
feast
for
so
used
the
young
men
to
do
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
saw
him
that
they
brought
thirty
companions
to
be
with
him
and
samson
said
unto
them
i
will
now
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
you
if
ye
can
certainly
declare
it
me
within
the
seven
days
of
the
feast
and
find
it
out
then
i
will
give
you
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments
but
if
ye
cannot
declare
it
me
then
shall
ye
give
me
thirty
sheets
and
thirty
change
of
garments
and
they
said
unto
him
put
forth
thy
riddle
that
we
may
hear
it
and
he
said
unto
them
out
of
the
eater
came
forth
meat
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
and
they
could
not
in
three
days
expound
the
riddle
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
they
said
unto
samson's
wife
entice
thy
husband
that
he
may
declare
unto
us
the
riddle
lest
we
burn
thee
and
thy
father's
house
with
fire
have
ye
called
us
to
take
that
we
have
is
it
not
so
and
samson's
wife
wept
before
him
and
said
thou
dost
but
hate
me
and
lovest
me
not
thou
hast
put
forth
a
riddle
unto
the
children
of
my
people
and
hast
not
told
it
me
and
he
said
unto
her
behold
i
have
not
told
it
my
father
nor
my
mother
and
shall
i
tell
it
thee
and
she
wept
before
him
the
seven
days
while
their
feast
lasted
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
he
told
her
because
she
lay
sore
upon
him
and
she
told
the
riddle
to
the
children
of
her
people
and
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
him
on
the
seventh
day
before
the
sun
went
down
what
is
sweeter
than
honey
and
what
is
stronger
than
a
lion
and
he
said
unto
them
if
ye
had
not
plowed
with
my
heifer
ye
had
not
found
out
my
riddle
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
he
went
down
to
ashkelon
and
slew
thirty
men
of
them
and
took
their
spoil
and
gave
change
of
garments
unto
them
which
expounded
the
riddle
and
his
anger
was
kindled
and
he
went
up
to
his
father's
house
but
samson's
wife
was
given
to
his
companion
whom
he
had
used
as
his
friend
but
it
came
to
pass
within
a
while
after
in
the
time
of
wheat
harvest
that
samson
visited
his
wife
with
a
kid
and
he
said
i
will
go
in
to
my
wife
into
the
chamber
but
her
father
would
not
suffer
him
to
go
in
and
her
father
said
i
verily
thought
that
thou
hadst
utterly
hated
her
therefore
i
gave
her
to
thy
companion
is
not
her
younger
sister
fairer
than
she
take
her
i
pray
thee
instead
of
her
and
samson
said
concerning
them
now
shall
i
be
more
blameless
than
the
philistines
though
i
do
them
a
displeasure
and
samson
went
and
caught
three
hundred
foxes
and
took
firebrands
and
turned
tail
to
tail
and
put
a
firebrand
in
the
midst
between
two
tails
and
when
he
had
set
the
brands
on
fire
he
let
them
go
into
the
standing
corn
of
the
philistines
and
burnt
up
both
the
shocks
and
also
the
standing
corn
with
the
vineyards
and
olives
then
the
philistines
said
who
hath
done
this
and
they
answered
samson
the
son
in
law
of
the
timnite
because
he
had
taken
his
wife
and
given
her
to
his
companion
and
the
philistines
came
up
and
burnt
her
and
her
father
with
fire
and
samson
said
unto
them
though
ye
have
done
this
yet
will
i
be
avenged
of
you
and
after
that
i
will
cease
and
he
smote
them
hip
and
thigh
with
a
great
slaughter
and
he
went
down
and
dwelt
in
the
top
of
the
rock
etam
then
the
philistines
went
up
and
pitched
in
judah
and
spread
themselves
in
lehi
and
the
men
of
judah
said
why
are
ye
come
up
against
us
and
they
answered
to
bind
samson
are
we
come
up
to
do
to
him
as
he
hath
done
to
us
then
three
thousand
men
of
judah
went
to
the
top
of
the
rock
etam
and
said
to
samson
knowest
thou
not
that
the
philistines
are
rulers
over
us
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
unto
us
and
he
said
unto
them
as
they
did
unto
me
so
have
i
done
unto
them
and
they
said
unto
him
we
are
come
down
to
bind
thee
that
we
may
deliver
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
samson
said
unto
them
swear
unto
me
that
ye
will
not
fall
upon
me
yourselves
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
no
but
we
will
bind
thee
fast
and
deliver
thee
into
their
hand
but
surely
we
will
not
kill
thee
and
they
bound
him
with
two
new
cords
and
brought
him
up
from
the
rock
and
when
he
came
unto
lehi
the
philistines
shouted
against
him
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
mightily
upon
him
and
the
cords
that
were
upon
his
arms
became
as
flax
that
was
burnt
with
fire
and
his
bands
loosed
from
off
his
hands
and
he
found
a
new
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
put
forth
his
hand
and
took
it
and
slew
a
thousand
men
therewith
and
samson
said
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
heaps
upon
heaps
with
the
jaw
of
an
ass
have
i
slain
a
thousand
men
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
that
he
cast
away
the
jawbone
out
of
his
hand
and
called
that
place
ramathlehi
and
he
was
sore
athirst
and
called
on
the
lord
and
said
thou
hast
given
this
great
deliverance
into
the
hand
of
thy
servant
and
now
shall
i
die
for
thirst
and
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
uncircumcised
but
god
clave
an
hollow
place
that
was
in
the
jaw
and
there
came
water
thereout
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
spirit
came
again
and
he
revived
wherefore
he
called
the
name
thereof
enhakkore
which
is
in
lehi
unto
this
day
and
he
judged
israel
in
the
days
of
the
philistines
twenty
years
then
went
samson
to
gaza
and
saw
there
an
harlot
and
went
in
unto
her
and
it
was
told
the
gazites
saying
samson
is
come
hither
and
they
compassed
him
in
and
laid
wait
for
him
all
night
in
the
gate
of
the
city
and
were
quiet
all
the
night
saying
in
the
morning
when
it
is
day
we
shall
kill
him
and
samson
lay
till
midnight
and
arose
at
midnight
and
took
the
doors
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
two
posts
and
went
away
with
them
bar
and
all
and
put
them
upon
his
shoulders
and
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
an
hill
that
is
before
hebron
and
it
came
to
pass
afterward
that
he
loved
a
woman
in
the
valley
of
sorek
whose
name
was
delilah
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
came
up
unto
her
and
said
unto
her
entice
him
and
see
wherein
his
great
strength
lieth
and
by
what
means
we
may
prevail
against
him
that
we
may
bind
him
to
afflict
him
and
we
will
give
thee
every
one
of
us
eleven
hundred
pieces
of
silver
and
delilah
said
to
samson
tell
me
i
pray
thee
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth
and
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
to
afflict
thee
and
samson
said
unto
her
if
they
bind
me
with
seven
green
withs
that
were
never
dried
then
shall
i
be
weak
and
be
as
another
man
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
brought
up
to
her
seven
green
withs
which
had
not
been
dried
and
she
bound
him
with
them
now
there
were
men
lying
in
wait
abiding
with
her
in
the
chamber
and
she
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
brake
the
withs
as
a
thread
of
tow
is
broken
when
it
toucheth
the
fire
so
his
strength
was
not
known
and
delilah
said
unto
samson
behold
thou
hast
mocked
me
and
told
me
lies
now
tell
me
i
pray
thee
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
and
he
said
unto
her
if
they
bind
me
fast
with
new
ropes
that
never
were
occupied
then
shall
i
be
weak
and
be
as
another
man
delilah
therefore
took
new
ropes
and
bound
him
therewith
and
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
there
were
liers
in
wait
abiding
in
the
chamber
and
he
brake
them
from
off
his
arms
like
a
thread
and
delilah
said
unto
samson
hitherto
thou
hast
mocked
me
and
told
me
lies
tell
me
wherewith
thou
mightest
be
bound
and
he
said
unto
her
if
thou
weavest
the
seven
locks
of
my
head
with
the
web
and
she
fastened
it
with
the
pin
and
said
unto
him
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
awaked
out
of
his
sleep
and
went
away
with
the
pin
of
the
beam
and
with
the
web
and
she
said
unto
him
how
canst
thou
say
i
love
thee
when
thine
heart
is
not
with
me
thou
hast
mocked
me
these
three
times
and
hast
not
told
me
wherein
thy
great
strength
lieth
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
pressed
him
daily
with
her
words
and
urged
him
so
that
his
soul
was
vexed
unto
death
that
he
told
her
all
his
heart
and
said
unto
her
there
hath
not
come
a
razor
upon
mine
head
for
i
have
been
a
nazarite
unto
god
from
my
mother's
womb
if
i
be
shaven
then
my
strength
will
go
from
me
and
i
shall
become
weak
and
be
like
any
other
man
and
when
delilah
saw
that
he
had
told
her
all
his
heart
she
sent
and
called
for
the
lords
of
the
philistines
saying
come
up
this
once
for
he
hath
shewed
me
all
his
heart
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
came
up
unto
her
and
brought
money
in
their
hand
and
she
made
him
sleep
upon
her
knees
and
she
called
for
a
man
and
she
caused
him
to
shave
off
the
seven
locks
of
his
head
and
she
began
to
afflict
him
and
his
strength
went
from
him
and
she
said
the
philistines
be
upon
thee
samson
and
he
awoke
out
of
his
sleep
and
said
i
will
go
out
as
at
other
times
before
and
shake
myself
and
he
wist
not
that
the
lord
was
departed
from
him
but
the
philistines
took
him
and
put
out
his
eyes
and
brought
him
down
to
gaza
and
bound
him
with
fetters
of
brass
and
he
did
grind
in
the
prison
house
howbeit
the
hair
of
his
head
began
to
grow
again
after
he
was
shaven
then
the
lords
of
the
philistines
gathered
them
together
for
to
offer
a
great
sacrifice
unto
dagon
their
god
and
to
rejoice
for
they
said
our
god
hath
delivered
samson
our
enemy
into
our
hand
and
when
the
people
saw
him
they
praised
their
god
for
they
said
our
god
hath
delivered
into
our
hands
our
enemy
and
the
destroyer
of
our
country
which
slew
many
of
us
and
it
came
to
pass
when
their
hearts
were
merry
that
they
said
call
for
samson
that
he
may
make
us
sport
and
they
called
for
samson
out
of
the
prison
house
and
he
made
them
sport
and
they
set
him
between
the
pillars
and
samson
said
unto
the
lad
that
held
him
by
the
hand
suffer
me
that
i
may
feel
the
pillars
whereupon
the
house
standeth
that
i
may
lean
upon
them
now
the
house
was
full
of
men
and
women
and
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
were
there
and
there
were
upon
the
roof
about
three
thousand
men
and
women
that
beheld
while
samson
made
sport
and
samson
called
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
remember
me
i
pray
thee
and
strengthen
me
i
pray
thee
only
this
once
o
god
that
i
may
be
at
once
avenged
of
the
philistines
for
my
two
eyes
and
samson
took
hold
of
the
two
middle
pillars
upon
which
the
house
stood
and
on
which
it
was
borne
up
of
the
one
with
his
right
hand
and
of
the
other
with
his
left
and
samson
said
let
me
die
with
the
philistines
and
he
bowed
himself
with
all
his
might
and
the
house
fell
upon
the
lords
and
upon
all
the
people
that
were
therein
so
the
dead
which
he
slew
at
his
death
were
more
than
they
which
he
slew
in
his
life
then
his
brethren
and
all
the
house
of
his
father
came
down
and
took
him
and
brought
him
up
and
buried
him
between
zorah
and
eshtaol
in
the
buryingplace
of
manoah
his
father
and
he
judged
israel
twenty
years
and
there
was
a
man
of
mount
ephraim
whose
name
was
micah
and
he
said
unto
his
mother
the
eleven
hundred
shekels
of
silver
that
were
taken
from
thee
about
which
thou
cursedst
and
spakest
of
also
in
mine
ears
behold
the
silver
is
with
me
i
took
it
and
his
mother
said
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
my
son
and
when
he
had
restored
the
eleven
hundred
shekels
of
silver
to
his
mother
his
mother
said
i
had
wholly
dedicated
the
silver
unto
the
lord
from
my
hand
for
my
son
to
make
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
now
therefore
i
will
restore
it
unto
thee
yet
he
restored
the
money
unto
his
mother
and
his
mother
took
two
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
gave
them
to
the
founder
who
made
thereof
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
and
they
were
in
the
house
of
micah
and
the
man
micah
had
an
house
of
gods
and
made
an
ephod
and
teraphim
and
consecrated
one
of
his
sons
who
became
his
priest
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
but
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
and
there
was
a
young
man
out
of
bethlehemjudah
of
the
family
of
judah
who
was
a
levite
and
he
sojourned
there
and
the
man
departed
out
of
the
city
from
bethlehemjudah
to
sojourn
where
he
could
find
a
place
and
he
came
to
mount
ephraim
to
the
house
of
micah
as
he
journeyed
and
micah
said
unto
him
whence
comest
thou
and
he
said
unto
him
i
am
a
levite
of
bethlehemjudah
and
i
go
to
sojourn
where
i
may
find
a
place
and
micah
said
unto
him
dwell
with
me
and
be
unto
me
a
father
and
a
priest
and
i
will
give
thee
ten
shekels
of
silver
by
the
year
and
a
suit
of
apparel
and
thy
victuals
so
the
levite
went
in
and
the
levite
was
content
to
dwell
with
the
man
and
the
young
man
was
unto
him
as
one
of
his
sons
and
micah
consecrated
the
levite
and
the
young
man
became
his
priest
and
was
in
the
house
of
micah
then
said
micah
now
know
i
that
the
lord
will
do
me
good
seeing
i
have
a
levite
to
my
priest
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
and
in
those
days
the
tribe
of
the
danites
sought
them
an
inheritance
to
dwell
in
for
unto
that
day
all
their
inheritance
had
not
fallen
unto
them
among
the
tribes
of
israel
and
the
children
of
dan
sent
of
their
family
five
men
from
their
coasts
men
of
valour
from
zorah
and
from
eshtaol
to
spy
out
the
land
and
to
search
it
and
they
said
unto
them
go
search
the
land
who
when
they
came
to
mount
ephraim
to
the
house
of
micah
they
lodged
there
when
they
were
by
the
house
of
micah
they
knew
the
voice
of
the
young
man
the
levite
and
they
turned
in
thither
and
said
unto
him
who
brought
thee
hither
and
what
makest
thou
in
this
place
and
what
hast
thou
here
and
he
said
unto
them
thus
and
thus
dealeth
micah
with
me
and
hath
hired
me
and
i
am
his
priest
and
they
said
unto
him
ask
counsel
we
pray
thee
of
god
that
we
may
know
whether
our
way
which
we
go
shall
be
prosperous
and
the
priest
said
unto
them
go
in
peace
before
the
lord
is
your
way
wherein
ye
go
then
the
five
men
departed
and
came
to
laish
and
saw
the
people
that
were
therein
how
they
dwelt
careless
after
the
manner
of
the
zidonians
quiet
and
secure
and
there
was
no
magistrate
in
the
land
that
might
put
them
to
shame
in
any
thing
and
they
were
far
from
the
zidonians
and
had
no
business
with
any
man
and
they
came
unto
their
brethren
to
zorah
and
eshtaol
and
their
brethren
said
unto
them
what
say
ye
and
they
said
arise
that
we
may
go
up
against
them
for
we
have
seen
the
land
and
behold
it
is
very
good
and
are
ye
still
be
not
slothful
to
go
and
to
enter
to
possess
the
land
when
ye
go
ye
shall
come
unto
a
people
secure
and
to
a
large
land
for
god
hath
given
it
into
your
hands
a
place
where
there
is
no
want
of
any
thing
that
is
in
the
earth
and
there
went
from
thence
of
the
family
of
the
danites
out
of
zorah
and
out
of
eshtaol
six
hundred
men
appointed
with
weapons
of
war
and
they
went
up
and
pitched
in
kirjathjearim
in
judah
wherefore
they
called
that
place
mahanehdan
unto
this
day
behold
it
is
behind
kirjathjearim
and
they
passed
thence
unto
mount
ephraim
and
came
unto
the
house
of
micah
then
answered
the
five
men
that
went
to
spy
out
the
country
of
laish
and
said
unto
their
brethren
do
ye
know
that
there
is
in
these
houses
an
ephod
and
teraphim
and
a
graven
image
and
a
molten
image
now
therefore
consider
what
ye
have
to
do
and
they
turned
thitherward
and
came
to
the
house
of
the
young
man
the
levite
even
unto
the
house
of
micah
and
saluted
him
and
the
six
hundred
men
appointed
with
their
weapons
of
war
which
were
of
the
children
of
dan
stood
by
the
entering
of
the
gate
and
the
five
men
that
went
to
spy
out
the
land
went
up
and
came
in
thither
and
took
the
graven
image
and
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
molten
image
and
the
priest
stood
in
the
entering
of
the
gate
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
appointed
with
weapons
of
war
and
these
went
into
micah's
house
and
fetched
the
carved
image
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
molten
image
then
said
the
priest
unto
them
what
do
ye
and
they
said
unto
him
hold
thy
peace
lay
thine
hand
upon
thy
mouth
and
go
with
us
and
be
to
us
a
father
and
a
priest
is
it
better
for
thee
to
be
a
priest
unto
the
house
of
one
man
or
that
thou
be
a
priest
unto
a
tribe
and
a
family
in
israel
and
the
priest's
heart
was
glad
and
he
took
the
ephod
and
the
teraphim
and
the
graven
image
and
went
in
the
midst
of
the
people
so
they
turned
and
departed
and
put
the
little
ones
and
the
cattle
and
the
carriage
before
them
and
when
they
were
a
good
way
from
the
house
of
micah
the
men
that
were
in
the
houses
near
to
micah's
house
were
gathered
together
and
overtook
the
children
of
dan
and
they
cried
unto
the
children
of
dan
and
they
turned
their
faces
and
said
unto
micah
what
aileth
thee
that
thou
comest
with
such
a
company
and
he
said
ye
have
taken
away
my
gods
which
i
made
and
the
priest
and
ye
are
gone
away
and
what
have
i
more
and
what
is
this
that
ye
say
unto
me
what
aileth
thee
and
the
children
of
dan
said
unto
him
let
not
thy
voice
be
heard
among
us
lest
angry
fellows
run
upon
thee
and
thou
lose
thy
life
with
the
lives
of
thy
household
and
the
children
of
dan
went
their
way
and
when
micah
saw
that
they
were
too
strong
for
him
he
turned
and
went
back
unto
his
house
and
they
took
the
things
which
micah
had
made
and
the
priest
which
he
had
and
came
unto
laish
unto
a
people
that
were
at
quiet
and
secure
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
burnt
the
city
with
fire
and
there
was
no
deliverer
because
it
was
far
from
zidon
and
they
had
no
business
with
any
man
and
it
was
in
the
valley
that
lieth
by
bethrehob
and
they
built
a
city
and
dwelt
therein
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
dan
after
the
name
of
dan
their
father
who
was
born
unto
israel
howbeit
the
name
of
the
city
was
laish
at
the
first
and
the
children
of
dan
set
up
the
graven
image
and
jonathan
the
son
of
gershom
the
son
of
manasseh
he
and
his
sons
were
priests
to
the
tribe
of
dan
until
the
day
of
the
captivity
of
the
land
and
they
set
them
up
micah's
graven
image
which
he
made
all
the
time
that
the
house
of
god
was
in
shiloh
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
when
there
was
no
king
in
israel
that
there
was
a
certain
levite
sojourning
on
the
side
of
mount
ephraim
who
took
to
him
a
concubine
out
of
bethlehemjudah
and
his
concubine
played
the
whore
against
him
and
went
away
from
him
unto
her
father's
house
to
bethlehemjudah
and
was
there
four
whole
months
and
her
husband
arose
and
went
after
her
to
speak
friendly
unto
her
and
to
bring
her
again
having
his
servant
with
him
and
a
couple
of
asses
and
she
brought
him
into
her
father's
house
and
when
the
father
of
the
damsel
saw
him
he
rejoiced
to
meet
him
and
his
father
in
law
the
damsel's
father
retained
him
and
he
abode
with
him
three
days
so
they
did
eat
and
drink
and
lodged
there
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
fourth
day
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
that
he
rose
up
to
depart
and
the
damsel's
father
said
unto
his
son
in
law
comfort
thine
heart
with
a
morsel
of
bread
and
afterward
go
your
way
and
they
sat
down
and
did
eat
and
drink
both
of
them
together
for
the
damsel's
father
had
said
unto
the
man
be
content
i
pray
thee
and
tarry
all
night
and
let
thine
heart
be
merry
and
when
the
man
rose
up
to
depart
his
father
in
law
urged
him
therefore
he
lodged
there
again
and
he
arose
early
in
the
morning
on
the
fifth
day
to
depart
and
the
damsel's
father
said
comfort
thine
heart
i
pray
thee
and
they
tarried
until
afternoon
and
they
did
eat
both
of
them
and
when
the
man
rose
up
to
depart
he
and
his
concubine
and
his
servant
his
father
in
law
the
damsel's
father
said
unto
him
behold
now
the
day
draweth
toward
evening
i
pray
you
tarry
all
night
behold
the
day
groweth
to
an
end
lodge
here
that
thine
heart
may
be
merry
and
to
morrow
get
you
early
on
your
way
that
thou
mayest
go
home
but
the
man
would
not
tarry
that
night
but
he
rose
up
and
departed
and
came
over
against
jebus
which
is
jerusalem
and
there
were
with
him
two
asses
saddled
his
concubine
also
was
with
him
and
when
they
were
by
jebus
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
come
i
pray
thee
and
let
us
turn
in
into
this
city
of
the
jebusites
and
lodge
in
it
and
his
master
said
unto
him
we
will
not
turn
aside
hither
into
the
city
of
a
stranger
that
is
not
of
the
children
of
israel
we
will
pass
over
to
gibeah
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
come
and
let
us
draw
near
to
one
of
these
places
to
lodge
all
night
in
gibeah
or
in
ramah
and
they
passed
on
and
went
their
way
and
the
sun
went
down
upon
them
when
they
were
by
gibeah
which
belongeth
to
benjamin
and
they
turned
aside
thither
to
go
in
and
to
lodge
in
gibeah
and
when
he
went
in
he
sat
him
down
in
a
street
of
the
city
for
there
was
no
man
that
took
them
into
his
house
to
lodging
and
behold
there
came
an
old
man
from
his
work
out
of
the
field
at
even
which
was
also
of
mount
ephraim
and
he
sojourned
in
gibeah
but
the
men
of
the
place
were
benjamites
and
when
he
had
lifted
up
his
eyes
he
saw
a
wayfaring
man
in
the
street
of
the
city
and
the
old
man
said
whither
goest
thou
and
whence
comest
thou
and
he
said
unto
him
we
are
passing
from
bethlehemjudah
toward
the
side
of
mount
ephraim
from
thence
am
i
and
i
went
to
bethlehemjudah
but
i
am
now
going
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
there
is
no
man
that
receiveth
me
to
house
yet
there
is
both
straw
and
provender
for
our
asses
and
there
is
bread
and
wine
also
for
me
and
for
thy
handmaid
and
for
the
young
man
which
is
with
thy
servants
there
is
no
want
of
any
thing
and
the
old
man
said
peace
be
with
thee
howsoever
let
all
thy
wants
lie
upon
me
only
lodge
not
in
the
street
so
he
brought
him
into
his
house
and
gave
provender
unto
the
asses
and
they
washed
their
feet
and
did
eat
and
drink
now
as
they
were
making
their
hearts
merry
behold
the
men
of
the
city
certain
sons
of
belial
beset
the
house
round
about
and
beat
at
the
door
and
spake
to
the
master
of
the
house
the
old
man
saying
bring
forth
the
man
that
came
into
thine
house
that
we
may
know
him
and
the
man
the
master
of
the
house
went
out
unto
them
and
said
unto
them
nay
my
brethren
nay
i
pray
you
do
not
so
wickedly
seeing
that
this
man
is
come
into
mine
house
do
not
this
folly
behold
here
is
my
daughter
a
maiden
and
his
concubine
them
i
will
bring
out
now
and
humble
ye
them
and
do
with
them
what
seemeth
good
unto
you
but
unto
this
man
do
not
so
vile
a
thing
but
the
men
would
not
hearken
to
him
so
the
man
took
his
concubine
and
brought
her
forth
unto
them
and
they
knew
her
and
abused
her
all
the
night
until
the
morning
and
when
the
day
began
to
spring
they
let
her
go
then
came
the
woman
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
and
fell
down
at
the
door
of
the
man's
house
where
her
lord
was
till
it
was
light
and
her
lord
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
and
went
out
to
go
his
way
and
behold
the
woman
his
concubine
was
fallen
down
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
her
hands
were
upon
the
threshold
and
he
said
unto
her
up
and
let
us
be
going
but
none
answered
then
the
man
took
her
up
upon
an
ass
and
the
man
rose
up
and
gat
him
unto
his
place
and
when
he
was
come
into
his
house
he
took
a
knife
and
laid
hold
on
his
concubine
and
divided
her
together
with
her
bones
into
twelve
pieces
and
sent
her
into
all
the
coasts
of
israel
and
it
was
so
that
all
that
saw
it
said
there
was
no
such
deed
done
nor
seen
from
the
day
that
the
children
of
israel
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
unto
this
day
consider
of
it
take
advice
and
speak
your
minds
then
all
the
children
of
israel
went
out
and
the
congregation
was
gathered
together
as
one
man
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
with
the
land
of
gilead
unto
the
lord
in
mizpeh
and
the
chief
of
all
the
people
even
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
presented
themselves
in
the
assembly
of
the
people
of
god
four
hundred
thousand
footmen
that
drew
sword
now
the
children
of
benjamin
heard
that
the
children
of
israel
were
gone
up
to
mizpeh
then
said
the
children
of
israel
tell
us
how
was
this
wickedness
and
the
levite
the
husband
of
the
woman
that
was
slain
answered
and
said
i
came
into
gibeah
that
belongeth
to
benjamin
i
and
my
concubine
to
lodge
and
the
men
of
gibeah
rose
against
me
and
beset
the
house
round
about
upon
me
by
night
and
thought
to
have
slain
me
and
my
concubine
have
they
forced
that
she
is
dead
and
i
took
my
concubine
and
cut
her
in
pieces
and
sent
her
throughout
all
the
country
of
the
inheritance
of
israel
for
they
have
committed
lewdness
and
folly
in
israel
behold
ye
are
all
children
of
israel
give
here
your
advice
and
counsel
and
all
the
people
arose
as
one
man
saying
we
will
not
any
of
us
go
to
his
tent
neither
will
we
any
of
us
turn
into
his
house
but
now
this
shall
be
the
thing
which
we
will
do
to
gibeah
we
will
go
up
by
lot
against
it
and
we
will
take
ten
men
of
an
hundred
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
and
an
hundred
of
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
out
of
ten
thousand
to
fetch
victual
for
the
people
that
they
may
do
when
they
come
to
gibeah
of
benjamin
according
to
all
the
folly
that
they
have
wrought
in
israel
so
all
the
men
of
israel
were
gathered
against
the
city
knit
together
as
one
man
and
the
tribes
of
israel
sent
men
through
all
the
tribe
of
benjamin
saying
what
wickedness
is
this
that
is
done
among
you
now
therefore
deliver
us
the
men
the
children
of
belial
which
are
in
gibeah
that
we
may
put
them
to
death
and
put
away
evil
from
israel
but
the
children
of
benjamin
would
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
their
brethren
the
children
of
israel
but
the
children
of
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
out
of
the
cities
unto
gibeah
to
go
out
to
battle
against
the
children
of
israel
and
the
children
of
benjamin
were
numbered
at
that
time
out
of
the
cities
twenty
and
six
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
beside
the
inhabitants
of
gibeah
which
were
numbered
seven
hundred
chosen
men
among
all
this
people
there
were
seven
hundred
chosen
men
lefthanded
every
one
could
sling
stones
at
an
hair
breadth
and
not
miss
and
the
men
of
israel
beside
benjamin
were
numbered
four
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
all
these
were
men
of
war

saying

yet
again

brother
or

and
the

up
for
to
morrow
i
will
deliver
them
into

hand
and
israel
set
liers
in
wait
round
about
gibeah
and
the
children
of
israel
went
up
against
the
children
of
benjamin
on
the
third
day
and
put
themselves
in
array
against
gibeah
as
at
other
times
and
the
children
of
benjamin
went
out
against
the
people
and
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
and
they
began
to
smite
of
the
people
and
kill
as
at
other
times
in
the
highways
of
which
one
goeth
up
to
the
house
of
god
and
the
other
to
gibeah
in
the
field
about
thirty
men
of
israel
and
the
children
of
benjamin
said
they
are
smitten
down
before
us
as
at
the
first
but
the
children
of
israel
said
let
us
flee
and
draw
them
from
the
city
unto
the
highways
and
all
the
men
of
israel
rose
up
out
of
their
place
and
put
themselves
in
array
at
baaltamar
and
the
liers
in
wait
of
israel
came
forth
out
of
their
places
even
out
of
the
meadows
of
gibeah
and
there
came
against
gibeah
ten
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
israel
and
the
battle
was
sore
but
they
knew
not
that
evil
was
near
them
and
the
lord
smote
benjamin
before
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
destroyed
of
the
benjamites
that
day
twenty
and
five
thousand
and
an
hundred
men
all
these
drew
the
sword
so
the
children
of
benjamin
saw
that
they
were
smitten
for
the
men
of
israel
gave
place
to
the
benjamites
because
they
trusted
unto
the
liers
in
wait
which
they
had
set
beside
gibeah
and
the
liers
in
wait
hasted
and
rushed
upon
gibeah
and
the
liers
in
wait
drew
themselves
along
and
smote
all
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
now
there
was
an
appointed
sign
between
the
men
of
israel
and
the
liers
in
wait
that
they
should
make
a
great
flame
with
smoke
rise
up
out
of
the
city
and
when
the
men
of
israel
retired
in
the
battle
benjamin
began
to
smite
and
kill
of
the
men
of
israel
about
thirty
persons
for
they
said
surely
they
are
smitten
down
before
us
as
in
the
first
battle
but
when
the
flame
began
to
arise
up
out
of
the
city
with
a
pillar
of
smoke
the
benjamites
looked
behind
them
and
behold
the
flame
of
the
city
ascended
up
to
heaven
and
when
the
men
of
israel
turned
again
the
men
of
benjamin
were
amazed
for
they
saw
that
evil
was
come
upon
them
therefore
they
turned
their
backs
before
the
men
of
israel
unto
the
way
of
the
wilderness
but
the
battle
overtook
them
and
them
which
came
out
of
the
cities
they
destroyed
in
the
midst
of
them
thus
they
inclosed
the
benjamites
round
about
and
chased
them
and
trode
them
down
with
ease
over
against
gibeah
toward
the
sunrising
and
there
fell
of
benjamin
eighteen
thousand
men
all
these
were
men
of
valour
and
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
of
rimmon
and
they
gleaned
of
them
in
the
highways
five
thousand
men
and
pursued
hard
after
them
unto
gidom
and
slew
two
thousand
men
of
them
so
that
all
which
fell
that
day
of
benjamin
were
twenty
and
five
thousand
men
that
drew
the
sword
all
these
were
men
of
valour
but
six
hundred
men
turned
and
fled
to
the
wilderness
unto
the
rock
rimmon
and
abode
in
the
rock
rimmon
four
months
and
the
men
of
israel
turned
again
upon
the
children
of
benjamin
and
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
as
well
the
men
of
every
city
as
the
beast
and
all
that
came
to
hand
also
they
set
on
fire
all
the
cities
that
they
came
to
now
the
men
of
israel
had
sworn
in
mizpeh
saying
there
shall
not
any
of
us
give
his
daughter
unto
benjamin
to
wife
and
the
people
came
to
the
house
of
god
and
abode
there
till
even
before
god
and
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
sore
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
why
is
this
come
to
pass
in
israel
that
there
should
be
to
day
one
tribe
lacking
in
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
people
rose
early
and
built
there
an
altar
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
and
the
children
of
israel
said
who
is
there
among
all
the
tribes
of
israel
that
came
not
up
with
the
congregation
unto
the
lord
for
they
had
made
a
great
oath
concerning
him
that
came
not
up
to
the
lord
to
mizpeh
saying
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
and
the
children
of
israel
repented
them
for
benjamin
their
brother
and
said
there
is
one
tribe
cut
off
from
israel
this
day
how
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain
seeing
we
have
sworn
by
the
lord
that
we
will
not
give
them
of
our
daughters
to
wives
and
they
said
what
one
is
there
of
the
tribes
of
israel
that
came
not
up
to
mizpeh
to
the
lord
and
behold
there
came
none
to
the
camp
from
jabeshgilead
to
the
assembly
for
the
people
were
numbered
and
behold
there
were
none
of
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
there
and
the
congregation
sent
thither
twelve
thousand
men
of
the
valiantest
and
commanded
them
saying
go
and
smite
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
with
the
women
and
the
children
and
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
ye
shall
utterly
destroy
every
male
and
every
woman
that
hath
lain
by
man
and
they
found
among
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
four
hundred
young
virgins
that
had
known
no
man
by
lying
with
any
male
and
they
brought
them
unto
the
camp
to
shiloh
which
is
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
the
whole
congregation
sent
some
to
speak
to
the
children
of
benjamin
that
were
in
the
rock
rimmon
and
to
call
peaceably
unto
them
and
benjamin
came
again
at
that
time
and
they
gave
them
wives
which
they
had
saved
alive
of
the
women
of
jabeshgilead
and
yet
so
they
sufficed
them
not
and
the
people
repented
them
for
benjamin
because
that
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
in
the
tribes
of
israel
then
the
elders
of
the
congregation
said
how
shall
we
do
for
wives
for
them
that
remain
seeing
the
women
are
destroyed
out
of
benjamin
and
they
said
there
must
be
an
inheritance
for
them
that
be
escaped
of
benjamin
that
a
tribe
be
not
destroyed
out
of
israel
howbeit
we
may
not
give
them
wives
of
our
daughters
for
the
children
of
israel
have
sworn
saying
cursed
be
he
that
giveth
a
wife
to
benjamin
then
they
said
behold
there
is
a
feast
of
the
lord
in
shiloh
yearly
in
a
place
which
is
on
the
north
side
of
bethel
on
the
east
side
of
the
highway
that
goeth
up
from
bethel
to
shechem
and
on
the
south
of
lebonah
therefore
they
commanded
the
children
of
benjamin
saying
go
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
vineyards
and
see
and
behold
if
the
daughters
of
shiloh
come
out
to
dance
in
dances
then
come
ye
out
of
the
vineyards
and
catch
you
every
man
his
wife
of
the
daughters
of
shiloh
and
go
to
the
land
of
benjamin
and
it
shall
be
when
their
fathers
or
their
brethren
come
unto
us
to
complain
that
we
will
say
unto
them
be
favourable
unto
them
for
our
sakes
because
we
reserved
not
to
each
man
his
wife
in
the
war
for
ye
did
not
give
unto
them
at
this
time
that
ye
should
be
guilty
and
the
children
of
benjamin
did
so
and
took
them
wives
according
to
their
number
of
them
that
danced
whom
they
caught
and
they
went
and
returned
unto
their
inheritance
and
repaired
the
cities
and
dwelt
in
them
and
the
children
of
israel
departed
thence
at
that
time
every
man
to
his
tribe
and
to
his
family
and
they
went
out
from
thence
every
man
to
his
inheritance
in
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
israel
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
the
book
of
ruth
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
when
the
judges
ruled
that
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land
and
a
certain
man
of
bethlehemjudah
went
to
sojourn
in
the
country
of
moab
he
and
his
wife
and
his
two
sons
and
the
name
of
the
man
was
elimelech
and
the
name
of
his
wife
naomi
and
the
name
of
his
two
sons
mahlon
and
chilion
ephrathites
of
bethlehemjudah
and
they
came
into
the
country
of
moab
and
continued
there
and
elimelech
naomi's
husband
died
and
she
was
left
and
her
two
sons
and
they
took
them
wives
of
the
women
of
moab
the
name
of
the
one
was
orpah
and
the
name
of
the
other
ruth
and
they
dwelled
there
about
ten
years
and
mahlon
and
chilion
died
also
both
of
them
and
the
woman
was
left
of
her
two
sons
and
her
husband
then
she
arose
with
her
daughters
in
law
that
she
might
return
from
the
country
of
moab
for
she
had
heard
in
the
country
of
moab
how
that
the
lord
had
visited
his
people
in
giving
them
bread
wherefore
she
went
forth
out
of
the
place
where
she
was
and
her
two
daughters
in
law
with
her
and
they
went
on
the
way
to
return
unto
the
land
of
judah
and
naomi
said
unto
her
two
daughters
in
law
go
return
each
to
her
mother's
house
the
lord
deal
kindly
with
you
as
ye
have
dealt
with
the
dead
and
with
me
the
lord
grant
you
that
ye
may
find
rest
each
of
you
in
the
house
of
her
husband
then
she
kissed
them
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
they
said
unto
her
surely
we
will
return
with
thee
unto
thy
people
and
naomi
said
turn
again
my
daughters
why
will
ye
go
with
me
are
there
yet
any
more
sons
in
my
womb
that
they
may
be
your
husbands
turn
again
my
daughters
go
your
way
for
i
am
too
old
to
have
an
husband
if
i
should
say
i
have
hope
if
i
should
have
an
husband
also
to
night
and
should
also
bear
sons
would
ye
tarry
for
them
till
they
were
grown
would
ye
stay
for
them
from
having
husbands
nay
my
daughters
for
it
grieveth
me
much
for
your
sakes
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
gone
out
against
me
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
again
and
orpah
kissed
her
mother
in
law
but
ruth
clave
unto
her
and
she
said
behold
thy
sister
in
law
is
gone
back
unto
her
people
and
unto
her
gods
return
thou
after
thy
sister
in
law
and
ruth
said
intreat
me
not
to
leave
thee
or
to
return
from
following
after
thee
for
whither
thou
goest
i
will
go
and
where
thou
lodgest
i
will
lodge
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
where
thou
diest
will
i
die
and
there
will
i
be
buried
the
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
ought
but
death
part
thee
and
me
when
she
saw
that
she
was
stedfastly
minded
to
go
with
her
then
she
left
speaking
unto
her
so
they
two
went
until
they
came
to
bethlehem
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
to
bethlehem
that
all
the
city
was
moved
about
them
and
they
said
is
this
naomi
and
she
said
unto
them
call
me
not
naomi
call
me
mara
for
the
almighty
hath
dealt
very
bitterly
with
me
i
went
out
full
and
the
lord
hath
brought
me
home
again
empty
why
then
call
ye
me
naomi
seeing
the
lord
hath
testified
against
me
and
the
almighty
hath
afflicted
me
so
naomi
returned
and
ruth
the
moabitess
her
daughter
in
law
with
her
which
returned
out
of
the
country
of
moab
and
they
came
to
bethlehem
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest
and
naomi
had
a
kinsman
of
her
husband's
a
mighty
man
of
wealth
of
the
family
of
elimelech
and
his
name
was
boaz
and
ruth
the
moabitess
said
unto
naomi
let
me
now
go
to
the
field
and
glean
ears
of
corn
after
him
in
whose
sight
i
shall
find
grace
and
she
said
unto
her
go
my
daughter
and
she
went
and
came
and
gleaned
in
the
field
after
the
reapers
and
her
hap
was
to
light
on
a
part
of
the
field
belonging
unto
boaz
who
was
of
the
kindred
of
elimelech
and
behold
boaz
came
from
bethlehem
and
said
unto
the
reapers
the
lord
be
with
you
and
they
answered
him
the
lord
bless
thee
then
said
boaz
unto
his
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers
whose
damsel
is
this
and
the
servant
that
was
set
over
the
reapers
answered
and
said
it
is
the
moabitish
damsel
that
came
back
with
naomi
out
of
the
country
of
moab
and
she
said
i
pray
you
let
me
glean
and
gather
after
the
reapers
among
the
sheaves
so
she
came
and
hath
continued
even
from
the
morning
until
now
that
she
tarried
a
little
in
the
house
then
said
boaz
unto
ruth
hearest
thou
not
my
daughter
go
not
to
glean
in
another
field
neither
go
from
hence
but
abide
here
fast
by
my
maidens
let
thine
eyes
be
on
the
field
that
they
do
reap
and
go
thou
after
them
have
i
not
charged
the
young
men
that
they
shall
not
touch
thee
and
when
thou
art
athirst
go
unto
the
vessels
and
drink
of
that
which
the
young
men
have
drawn
then
she
fell
on
her
face
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
and
said
unto
him
why
have
i
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
that
thou
shouldest
take
knowledge
of
me
seeing
i
am
a
stranger
and
boaz
answered
and
said
unto
her
it
hath
fully
been
shewed
me
all
that
thou
hast
done
unto
thy
mother
in
law
since
the
death
of
thine
husband
and
how
thou
hast
left
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
the
land
of
thy
nativity
and
art
come
unto
a
people
which
thou
knewest
not
heretofore
the
lord
recompense
thy
work
and
a
full
reward
be
given
thee
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
under
whose
wings
thou
art
come
to
trust
then
she
said
let
me
find
favour
in
thy
sight
my
lord
for
that
thou
hast
comforted
me
and
for
that
thou
hast
spoken
friendly
unto
thine
handmaid
though
i
be
not
like
unto
one
of
thine
handmaidens
and
boaz
said
unto
her
at
mealtime
come
thou
hither
and
eat
of
the
bread
and
dip
thy
morsel
in
the
vinegar
and
she
sat
beside
the
reapers
and
he
reached
her
parched
corn
and
she
did
eat
and
was
sufficed
and
left
and
when
she
was
risen
up
to
glean
boaz
commanded
his
young
men
saying
let
her
glean
even
among
the
sheaves
and
reproach
her
not
and
let
fall
also
some
of
the
handfuls
of
purpose
for
her
and
leave
them
that
she
may
glean
them
and
rebuke
her
not
so
she
gleaned
in
the
field
until
even
and
beat
out
that
she
had
gleaned
and
it
was
about
an
ephah
of
barley
and
she
took
it
up
and
went
into
the
city
and
her
mother
in
law
saw
what
she
had
gleaned
and
she
brought
forth
and
gave
to
her
that
she
had
reserved
after
she
was
sufficed
and
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her
where
hast
thou
gleaned
to
day
and
where
wroughtest
thou
blessed
be
he
that
did
take
knowledge
of
thee
and
she
shewed
her
mother
in
law
with
whom
she
had
wrought
and
said
the
man's
name
with
whom
i
wrought
to
day
is
boaz
and
naomi
said
unto
her
daughter
in
law
blessed
be
he
of
the
lord
who
hath
not
left
off
his
kindness
to
the
living
and
to
the
dead
and
naomi
said
unto
her
the
man
is
near
of
kin
unto
us
one
of
our
next
kinsmen
and
ruth
the
moabitess
said
he
said
unto
me
also
thou
shalt
keep
fast
by
my
young
men
until
they
have
ended
all
my
harvest
and
naomi
said
unto
ruth
her
daughter
in
law
it
is
good
my
daughter
that
thou
go
out
with
his
maidens
that
they
meet
thee
not
in
any
other
field
so
she
kept
fast
by
the
maidens
of
boaz
to
glean
unto
the
end
of
barley
harvest
and
of
wheat
harvest
and
dwelt
with
her
mother
in
law
then
naomi
her
mother
in
law
said
unto
her
my
daughter
shall
i
not
seek
rest
for
thee
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
now
is
not
boaz
of
our
kindred
with
whose
maidens
thou
wast
behold
he
winnoweth
barley
to
night
in
the
threshingfloor
wash
thyself
therefore
and
anoint
thee
and
put
thy
raiment
upon
thee
and
get
thee
down
to
the
floor
but
make
not
thyself
known
unto
the
man
until
he
shall
have
done
eating
and
drinking
and
it
shall
be
when
he
lieth
down
that
thou
shalt
mark
the
place
where
he
shall
lie
and
thou
shalt
go
in
and
uncover
his
feet
and
lay
thee
down
and
he
will
tell
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
and
she
said
unto
her
all
that
thou
sayest
unto
me
i
will
do
and
she
went
down
unto
the
floor
and
did
according
to
all
that
her
mother
in
law
bade
her
and
when
boaz
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
his
heart
was
merry
he
went
to
lie
down
at
the
end
of
the
heap
of
corn
and
she
came
softly
and
uncovered
his
feet
and
laid
her
down
and
it
came
to
pass
at
midnight
that
the
man
was
afraid
and
turned
himself
and
behold
a
woman
lay
at
his
feet
and
he
said
who
art
thou
and
she
answered
i
am
ruth
thine
handmaid
spread
therefore
thy
skirt
over
thine
handmaid
for
thou
art
a
near
kinsman
and
he
said
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
my
daughter
for
thou
hast
shewed
more
kindness
in
the
latter
end
than
at
the
beginning
inasmuch
as
thou
followedst
not
young
men
whether
poor
or
rich
and
now
my
daughter
fear
not
i
will
do
to
thee
all
that
thou
requirest
for
all
the
city
of
my
people
doth
know
that
thou
art
a
virtuous
woman
and
now
it
is
true
that
i
am
thy
near
kinsman
howbeit
there
is
a
kinsman
nearer
than
i
tarry
this
night
and
it
shall
be
in
the
morning
that
if
he
will
perform
unto
thee
the
part
of
a
kinsman
well
let
him
do
the
kinsman's
part
but
if
he
will
not
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee
then
will
i
do
the
part
of
a
kinsman
to
thee
as
the
lord
liveth
lie
down
until
the
morning
and
she
lay
at
his
feet
until
the
morning
and
she
rose
up
before
one
could
know
another
and
he
said
let
it
not
be
known
that
a
woman
came
into
the
floor
also
he
said
bring
the
vail
that
thou
hast
upon
thee
and
hold
it
and
when
she
held
it
he
measured
six
measures
of
barley
and
laid
it
on
her
and
she
went
into
the
city
and
when
she
came
to
her
mother
in
law
she
said
who
art
thou
my
daughter
and
she
told
her
all
that
the
man
had
done
to
her
and
she
said
these
six
measures
of
barley
gave
he
me
for
he
said
to
me
go
not
empty
unto
thy
mother
in
law
then
said
she
sit
still
my
daughter
until
thou
know
how
the
matter
will
fall
for
the
man
will
not
be
in
rest
until
he
have
finished
the
thing
this
day
then
went
boaz
up
to
the
gate
and
sat
him
down
there
and
behold
the
kinsman
of
whom
boaz
spake
came
by
unto
whom
he
said
ho
such
a
one
turn
aside
sit
down
here
and
he
turned
aside
and
sat
down
and
he
took
ten
men
of
the
elders
of
the
city
and
said
sit
ye
down
here
and
they
sat
down
and
he
said
unto
the
kinsman
naomi
that
is
come
again
out
of
the
country
of
moab
selleth
a
parcel
of
land
which
was
our
brother
elimelech's
and
i
thought
to
advertise
thee
saying
buy
it
before
the
inhabitants
and
before
the
elders
of
my
people
if
thou
wilt
redeem
it
redeem
it
but
if
thou
wilt
not
redeem
it
then
tell
me
that
i
may
know
for
there
is
none
to
redeem
it
beside
thee
and
i
am
after
thee
and
he
said
i
will
redeem
it
then
said
boaz
what
day
thou
buyest
the
field
of
the
hand
of
naomi
thou
must
buy
it
also
of
ruth
the
moabitess
the
wife
of
the
dead
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance
and
the
kinsman
said
i
cannot
redeem
it
for
myself
lest
i
mar
mine
own
inheritance
redeem
thou
my
right
to
thyself
for
i
cannot
redeem
it
now
this
was
the
manner
in
former
time
in
israel
concerning
redeeming
and
concerning
changing
for
to
confirm
all
things
a
man
plucked
off
his
shoe
and
gave
it
to
his
neighbour
and
this
was
a
testimony
in
israel
therefore
the
kinsman
said
unto
boaz
buy
it
for
thee
so
he
drew
off
his
shoe
and
boaz
said
unto
the
elders
and
unto
all
the
people
ye
are
witnesses
this
day
that
i
have
bought
all
that
was
elimelech's
and
all
that
was
chilion's
and
mahlon's
of
the
hand
of
naomi
moreover
ruth
the
moabitess
the
wife
of
mahlon
have
i
purchased
to
be
my
wife
to
raise
up
the
name
of
the
dead
upon
his
inheritance
that
the
name
of
the
dead
be
not
cut
off
from
among
his
brethren
and
from
the
gate
of
his
place
ye
are
witnesses
this
day
and
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
gate
and
the
elders
said
we
are
witnesses
the
lord
make
the
woman
that
is
come
into
thine
house
like
rachel
and
like
leah
which
two
did
build
the
house
of
israel
and
do
thou
worthily
in
ephratah
and
be
famous
in
bethlehem
and
let
thy
house
be
like
the
house
of
pharez
whom
tamar
bare
unto
judah
of
the
seed
which
the
lord
shall
give
thee
of
this
young
woman
so
boaz
took
ruth
and
she
was
his
wife
and
when
he
went
in
unto
her
the
lord
gave
her
conception
and
she
bare
a
son
and
the
women
said
unto
naomi
blessed
be
the
lord
which
hath
not
left
thee
this
day
without
a
kinsman
that
his
name
may
be
famous
in
israel
and
he
shall
be
unto
thee
a
restorer
of
thy
life
and
a
nourisher
of
thine
old
age
for
thy
daughter
in
law
which
loveth
thee
which
is
better
to
thee
than
seven
sons
hath
born
him
and
naomi
took
the
child
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom
and
became
nurse
unto
it
and
the
women
her
neighbours
gave
it
a
name
saying
there
is
a
son
born
to
naomi
and
they
called
his
name
obed
he
is
the
father
of
jesse
the
father
of
david
now
these
are
the
generations
of
pharez

david
the
first
book
of
samuel
otherwise
called
the
first
book
of
the
kings
now
there
was
a
certain
man
of
ramathaimzophim
of
mount
ephraim
and
his
name
was
elkanah
the
son
of
jeroham
the
son
of
elihu
the
son
of
tohu
the
son
of
zuph
an
ephrathite
and
he
had
two
wives
the
name
of
the
one
was
hannah
and
the
name
of
the
other
peninnah
and
peninnah
had
children
but
hannah
had
no
children
and
this
man
went
up
out
of
his
city
yearly
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
of
hosts
in
shiloh
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
the
priests
of
the
lord
were
there
and
when
the
time
was
that
elkanah
offered
he
gave
to
peninnah
his
wife
and
to
all
her
sons
and
her
daughters
portions
but
unto
hannah
he
gave
a
worthy
portion
for
he
loved
hannah
but
the
lord
had
shut
up
her
womb
and
her
adversary
also
provoked
her
sore
for
to
make
her
fret
because
the
lord
had
shut
up
her
womb
and
as
he
did
so
year
by
year
when
she
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
so
she
provoked
her
therefore
she
wept
and
did
not
eat
then
said
elkanah
her
husband
to
her
hannah
why
weepest
thou
and
why
eatest
thou
not
and
why
is
thy
heart
grieved
am
not
i
better
to
thee
than
ten
sons
so
hannah
rose
up
after
they
had
eaten
in
shiloh
and
after
they
had
drunk
now
eli
the
priest
sat
upon
a
seat
by
a
post
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
she
was
in
bitterness
of
soul
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
wept
sore
and
she
vowed
a
vow
and
said
o
lord
of
hosts
if
thou
wilt
indeed
look
on
the
affliction
of
thine
handmaid
and
remember
me
and
not
forget
thine
handmaid
but
wilt
give
unto
thine
handmaid
a
man
child
then
i
will
give
him
unto
the
lord
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
there
shall
no
razor
come
upon
his
head
and
it
came
to
pass
as
she
continued
praying
before
the
lord
that
eli
marked
her
mouth
now
hannah
she
spake
in
her
heart
only
her
lips
moved
but
her
voice
was
not
heard
therefore
eli
thought
she
had
been
drunken
and
eli
said
unto
her
how
long
wilt
thou
be
drunken
put
away
thy
wine
from
thee
and
hannah
answered
and
said
no
my
lord
i
am
a
woman
of
a
sorrowful
spirit
i
have
drunk
neither
wine
nor
strong
drink
but
have
poured
out
my
soul
before
the
lord
count
not
thine
handmaid
for
a
daughter
of
belial
for
out
of
the
abundance
of
my
complaint
and
grief
have
i
spoken
hitherto
then
eli
answered
and
said
go
in
peace
and
the
god
of
israel
grant
thee
thy
petition
that
thou
hast
asked
of
him
and
she
said
let
thine
handmaid
find
grace
in
thy
sight
so
the
woman
went
her
way
and
did
eat
and
her
countenance
was
no
more
sad
and
they
rose
up
in
the
morning
early
and
worshipped
before
the
lord
and
returned
and
came
to
their
house
to
ramah
and
elkanah
knew
hannah
his
wife
and
the
lord
remembered
her
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
when
the
time
was
come
about
after
hannah
had
conceived
that
she
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
samuel
saying
because
i
have
asked
him
of
the
lord
and
the
man
elkanah
and
all
his
house
went
up
to
offer
unto
the
lord
the
yearly
sacrifice
and
his
vow
but
hannah
went
not
up
for
she
said
unto
her
husband
i
will
not
go
up
until
the
child
be
weaned
and
then
i
will
bring
him
that
he
may
appear
before
the
lord
and
there
abide
for
ever
and
elkanah
her
husband
said
unto
her
do
what
seemeth
thee
good
tarry
until
thou
have
weaned
him
only
the
lord
establish
his
word
so
the
woman
abode
and
gave
her
son
suck
until
she
weaned
him
and
when
she
had
weaned
him
she
took
him
up
with
her
with
three
bullocks
and
one
ephah
of
flour
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
brought
him
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
in
shiloh
and
the
child
was
young
and
they
slew
a
bullock
and
brought
the
child
to
eli
and
she
said
oh
my
lord
as
thy
soul
liveth
my
lord
i
am
the
woman
that
stood
by
thee
here
praying
unto
the
lord
for
this
child
i
prayed
and
the
lord
hath
given
me
my
petition
which
i
asked
of
him
therefore
also
i
have
lent
him
to
the
lord
as
long
as
he
liveth
he
shall
be
lent
to
the
lord
and
he
worshipped
the
lord
there
and
hannah
prayed
and
said
my
heart
rejoiceth
in
the
lord
mine
horn
is
exalted
in
the
lord
my
mouth
is
enlarged
over
mine
enemies
because
i
rejoice
in
thy
salvation
there
is
none
holy
as
the
lord
for
there
is
none
beside
thee
neither
is
there
any
rock
like
our
god
talk
no
more
so
exceeding
proudly
let
not
arrogancy
come
out
of
your
mouth
for
the
lord
is
a
god
of
knowledge
and
by
him
actions
are
weighed
the
bows
of
the
mighty
men
are
broken
and
they
that
stumbled
are
girded
with
strength
they
that
were
full
have
hired
out
themselves
for
bread
and
they
that
were
hungry
ceased
so
that
the
barren
hath
born
seven
and
she
that
hath
many
children
is
waxed
feeble
the
lord
killeth
and
maketh
alive
he
bringeth
down
to
the
grave
and
bringeth
up
the
lord
maketh
poor
and
maketh
rich
he
bringeth
low
and
lifteth
up
he
raiseth
up
the
poor
out
of
the
dust
and
lifteth
up
the
beggar
from
the
dunghill
to
set
them
among
princes
and
to
make
them
inherit
the
throne
of
glory
for
the
pillars
of
the
earth
are
the
lord's
and
he
hath
set
the
world
upon
them
he
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
saints
and
the
wicked
shall
be
silent
in
darkness
for
by
strength
shall
no
man
prevail
the
adversaries
of
the
lord
shall
be
broken
to
pieces
out
of
heaven
shall
he
thunder
upon
them
the
lord
shall
judge
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
give
strength
unto
his
king
and
exalt
the
horn
of
his
anointed
and
elkanah
went
to
ramah
to
his
house
and
the
child
did
minister
unto
the
lord
before
eli
the
priest
now
the
sons
of
eli
were
sons
of
belial
they
knew
not
the
lord
and
the
priest's
custom
with
the
people
was
that
when
any
man
offered
sacrifice
the
priest's
servant
came
while
the
flesh
was
in
seething
with
a
fleshhook
of
three
teeth
in
his
hand
and
he
struck
it
into
the
pan
or
kettle
or
caldron
or
pot
all
that
the
fleshhook
brought
up
the
priest
took
for
himself
so
they
did
in
shiloh
unto
all
the
israelites
that
came
thither
also
before
they
burnt
the
fat
the
priest's
servant
came
and
said
to
the
man
that
sacrificed
give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
priest
for
he
will
not
have
sodden
flesh
of
thee
but
raw
and
if
any
man
said
unto
him
let
them
not
fail
to
burn
the
fat
presently
and
then
take
as
much
as
thy
soul
desireth
then
he
would
answer
him
nay
but
thou
shalt
give
it
me
now
and
if
not
i
will
take
it
by
force
wherefore
the
sin
of
the
young
men
was
very
great
before
the
lord
for
men
abhorred
the
offering
of
the
lord
but
samuel
ministered
before
the
lord
being
a
child
girded
with
a
linen
ephod
moreover
his
mother
made
him
a
little
coat
and
brought
it
to
him
from
year
to
year
when
she
came
up
with
her
husband
to
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice
and
eli
blessed
elkanah
and
his
wife
and
said
the
lord
give
thee
seed
of
this
woman
for
the
loan
which
is
lent
to
the
lord
and
they
went
unto
their
own
home
and
the
lord
visited
hannah
so
that
she
conceived
and
bare
three
sons
and
two
daughters
and
the
child
samuel
grew
before
the
lord
now
eli
was
very
old
and
heard
all
that
his
sons
did
unto
all
israel
and
how
they
lay
with
the
women
that
assembled
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
he
said
unto
them
why
do
ye
such
things
for
i
hear
of
your
evil
dealings
by
all
this
people
nay
my
sons
for
it
is
no
good
report
that
i
hear
ye
make
the
lord's
people
to
transgress
if
one
man
sin
against
another
the
judge
shall
judge
him
but
if
a
man
sin
against
the
lord
who
shall
intreat
for
him
notwithstanding
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
their
father
because
the
lord
would
slay
them
and
the
child
samuel
grew
on
and
was
in
favour
both
with
the
lord
and
also
with
men
and
there
came
a
man
of
god
unto
eli
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
did
i
plainly
appear
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
when
they
were
in
egypt
in
pharaoh's
house
and
did
i
choose
him
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
be
my
priest
to
offer
upon
mine
altar
to
burn
incense
to
wear
an
ephod
before
me
and
did
i
give
unto
the
house
of
thy
father
all
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
children
of
israel
wherefore
kick
ye
at
my
sacrifice
and
at
mine
offering
which
i
have
commanded
in
my
habitation
and
honourest
thy
sons
above
me
to
make
yourselves
fat
with
the
chiefest
of
all
the
offerings
of
israel
my
people
wherefore
the
lord
god
of
israel
saith
i
said
indeed
that
thy
house
and
the
house
of
thy
father
should
walk
before
me
for
ever
but
now
the
lord
saith
be
it
far
from
me
for
them
that
honour
me
i
will
honour
and
they
that
despise
me
shall
be
lightly
esteemed
behold
the
days
come
that
i
will
cut
off
thine
arm
and
the
arm
of
thy
father's
house
that
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
and
thou
shalt
see
an
enemy
in
my
habitation
in
all
the
wealth
which
god
shall
give
israel
and
there
shall
not
be
an
old
man
in
thine
house
for
ever
and
the
man
of
thine
whom
i
shall
not
cut
off
from
mine
altar
shall
be
to
consume
thine
eyes
and
to
grieve
thine
heart
and
all
the
increase
of
thine
house
shall
die
in
the
flower
of
their
age
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
shall
come
upon
thy
two
sons
on
hophni
and
phinehas
in
one
day
they
shall
die
both
of
them
and
i
will
raise
me
up
a
faithful
priest
that
shall
do
according
to
that
which
is
in
mine
heart
and
in
my
mind
and
i
will
build
him
a
sure
house
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
ever
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
one
that
is
left
in
thine
house
shall
come
and
crouch
to
him
for
a
piece
of
silver
and
a
morsel
of
bread
and
shall
say
put
me
i
pray
thee
into
one
of
the
priests
offices
that
i
may
eat
a
piece
of
bread
and
the
child
samuel
ministered
unto
the
lord
before
eli
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
precious
in
those
days
there
was
no
open
vision
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
eli
was
laid
down
in
his
place
and
his
eyes
began
to
wax
dim
that
he
could
not
see
and
ere
the
lamp
of
god
went
out
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
where
the
ark
of
god
was
and
samuel
was
laid
down
to
sleep
that
the
lord
called
samuel
and
he
answered
here
am
i
and
he
ran
unto
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
calledst
me
and
he
said
i
called
not
lie
down
again
and
he
went
and
lay
down
and
the
lord
called
yet
again
samuel
and
samuel
arose
and
went
to
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
didst
call
me
and
he
answered
i
called
not
my
son
lie
down
again
now
samuel
did
not
yet
know
the
lord
neither
was
the
word
of
the
lord
yet
revealed
unto
him
and
the
lord
called
samuel
again
the
third
time
and
he
arose
and
went
to
eli
and
said
here
am
i
for
thou
didst
call
me
and
eli
perceived
that
the
lord
had
called
the
child
therefore
eli
said
unto
samuel
go
lie
down
and
it
shall
be
if
he
call
thee
that
thou
shalt
say
speak
lord
for
thy
servant
heareth
so
samuel
went
and
lay
down
in
his
place
and
the
lord
came
and
stood
and
called
as
at
other
times
samuel
samuel
then
samuel
answered
speak
for
thy
servant
heareth
and
the
lord
said
to
samuel
behold
i
will
do
a
thing
in
israel
at
which
both
the
ears
of
every
one
that
heareth
it
shall
tingle
in
that
day
i
will
perform
against
eli
all
things
which
i
have
spoken
concerning
his
house
when
i
begin
i
will
also
make
an
end
for
i
have
told
him
that
i
will
judge
his
house
for
ever
for
the
iniquity
which
he
knoweth
because
his
sons
made
themselves
vile
and
he
restrained
them
not
and
therefore
i
have
sworn
unto
the
house
of
eli
that
the
iniquity
of
eli's
house
shall
not
be
purged
with
sacrifice
nor
offering
for
ever
and
samuel
lay
until
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
samuel
feared
to
shew
eli
the
vision
