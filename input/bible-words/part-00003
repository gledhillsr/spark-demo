and
david
consulted
with

and
with

leader
and
david
said
unto
all
the
congregation
of

if
it
seem
good
unto
you
and
that
it
be
of
the
lord
our
god
let

send

unto
our

every
where
that
are
left
in
all
the
land
of
israel
and
with
them
also
to
the
priests
and
levites
which
are
in
their
cities
and
suburbs
that
they
may
gather
themselves
unto
us
and
let
us
bring
again
the
ark
of
our
god
to
us
for
we
enquired
not
at
it
in
the
days
of
saul
and
all
the
congregation
said
that
they
would
do
so
for
the
thing
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
people
so
david
gathered
all
israel
together
from
shihor
of
egypt
even
unto
the
entering
of
hemath
to
bring
the
ark
of
god
from
kirjathjearim
and
david
went
up
and
all
israel
to
baalah
that
is
to
kirjathjearim
which
belonged
to
judah
to
bring
up
thence
the
ark
of
god
the
lord
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims
whose
name
is
called
on
it
and
they
carried
the
ark
of
god
in
a
new
cart
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
and
uzza
and
ahio
drave
the
cart
and
david
and
all
israel
played
before
god
with
all
their
might
and
with
singing
and
with
harps
and
with
psalteries
and
with
timbrels
and
with
cymbals
and
with
trumpets
and
when
they
came
unto
the
threshingfloor
of
chidon
uzza
put
forth
his
hand
to
hold
the
ark
for
the
oxen
stumbled
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
uzza
and
he
smote
him
because
he
put
his
hand
to
the
ark
and
there
he
died
before
god
and
david
was
displeased
because
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
upon
uzza
wherefore
that
place
is
called
perezuzza
to
this
day
and
david
was
afraid
of
god
that
day
saying
how
shall
i
bring
the
ark
of
god
home
to
me
so
david
brought
not
the
ark
home
to
himself
to
the
city
of
david
but
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
and
the
ark
of
god
remained
with
the
family
of
obededom
in
his
house
three
months
and
the
lord
blessed
the
house
of
obededom
and
all
that
he
had
now
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
messengers
to
david
and
timber
of
cedars
with
masons
and
carpenters
to
build
him
an
house
and
david
perceived
that
the
lord
had
confirmed
him
king
over
israel
for
his
kingdom
was
lifted
up
on
high
because
of
his
people
israel
and
david
took
more
wives
at
jerusalem
and
david
begat
more
sons
and
daughters
now
these
are
the
names
of
his
children
which
he
had
in
jerusalem
shammua
and
shobab
nathan
and
solomon
and
ibhar
and
elishua
and
elpalet
and
nogah
and
nepheg
and
japhia
and
elishama
and
beeliada
and
eliphalet
and
when
the
philistines
heard
that
david
was
anointed
king
over
all
israel
all
the
philistines
went
up
to
seek
david
and
david
heard
of
it
and
went
out
against
them
and
the
philistines
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
and
david
enquired
of
god
saying
shall
i
go
up
against
the
philistines
and
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
up
for
i
will
deliver
them
into
thine
hand
so
they
came
up
to
baalperazim
and
david
smote
them
there
then
david
said
god
hath
broken
in
upon
mine
enemies
by
mine
hand
like
the
breaking
forth
of
waters
therefore
they
called
the
name
of
that
place
baalperazim
and
when
they
had
left
their
gods
there
david
gave
a
commandment
and
they
were
burned
with
fire
and
the
philistines
yet
again
spread
themselves
abroad
in
the
valley
therefore
david
enquired
again
of
god
and
god
said
unto
him
go
not
up
after
them
turn
away
from
them
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees
and
it
shall
be
when
thou
shalt
hear
a
sound
of
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
that
then
thou
shalt
go
out
to
battle
for
god
is
gone
forth
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
philistines
david
therefore
did
as
god
commanded
him
and
they
smote
the
host
of
the
philistines
from
gibeon
even
to
gazer
and
the
fame
of
david
went
out
into
all
lands
and
the
lord
brought
the
fear
of
him
upon
all
nations
and
david
made
him
houses
in
the
city
of
david
and
prepared
a
place
for
the
ark
of
god
and
pitched
for
it
a
tent
then
david
said
none
ought
to
carry
the
ark
of
god
but
the
levites
for
them
hath
the
lord
chosen
to
carry
the
ark
of
god
and
to
minister
unto
him
for
ever
and
david
gathered
all
israel
together
to
jerusalem
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
unto
his
place
which
he
had
prepared
for
it
and

and
with
sound
of
the
cornet
and
with

and
with

making
a
noise
with

and
it
came
to

daughter
of
saul
looking
out
at
a
window
saw

david
dancing

playing
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart
so
they
brought
the

and
set
it
in

midst
of
the

that
david
had
pitched
for
it

and
all
the
people
departed
every
man
to
his
house
and
david
returned
to
bless
his
house
now
it
came
to
pass
as
david
sat
in
his
house
that
david
said
to
nathan
the
prophet
lo
i
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedars
but
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
remaineth
under
curtains
then
nathan
said
unto
david
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
for
god
is
with
thee
and
it
came
to
pass
the
same
night
that
the
word
of
god
came
to
nathan
saying
go
and
tell
david
my
servant
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
not
build
me
an
house
to
dwell
in
for
i
have
not
dwelt
in
an
house
since
the
day
that
i
brought
up
israel
unto
this
day
but
have
gone
from
tent
to
tent
and
from
one
tabernacle
to
another
wheresoever
i
have
walked
with
all
israel
spake
i
a
word
to
any
of
the
judges
of
israel
whom
i
commanded
to
feed
my
people
saying
why
have
ye
not
built
me
an
house
of
cedars
now
therefore
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote
even
from
following
the
sheep
that
thou
shouldest
be
ruler
over
my
people
israel
and
i
have
been
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
hast
walked
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
from
before
thee
and
have
made
thee
a
name
like
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
earth
also
i
will
ordain
a
place
for
my
people
israel
and
will
plant
them
and
they
shall
dwell
in
their
place
and
shall
be
moved
no
more
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
waste
them
any
more
as
at
the
beginning
and
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
israel
moreover
i
will
subdue
all
thine
enemies
furthermore
i
tell
thee
that
the
lord
will
build
thee
an
house
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thy
days
be
expired
that
thou
must
go
to
be
with
thy
fathers
that
i
will
raise
up
thy
seed
after
thee
which
shall
be
of
thy
sons
and
i
will
establish
his
kingdom
he
shall
build
me
an
house
and
i
will
stablish
his
throne
for
ever
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
and
i
will
not
take
my
mercy
away
from
him
as
i
took
it
from
him
that
was
before
thee
but
i
will
settle
him
in
mine
house
and
in
my
kingdom
for
ever
and
his
throne
shall
be
established
for
evermore
according
to
all
these
words
and
according
to
all
this
vision
so
did
nathan
speak
unto
david
and
david
the
king
came
and
sat
before
the
lord
and
said
who
am
i
o
lord
god
and
what
is
mine
house
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto
and
yet
this
was
a
small
thing
in
thine
eyes
o
god
for
thou
hast
also
spoken
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
to
come
and
hast
regarded
me
according
to
the
estate
of
a
man
of
high
degree
o
lord
god
what
can
david
speak
more
to
thee
for
the
honour
of
thy
servant
for
thou
knowest
thy
servant
o
lord
for
thy
servant's
sake
and
according
to
thine
own
heart
hast
thou
done
all
this
greatness
in
making
known
all
these
great
things
o
lord
there
is
none
like
thee
neither
is
there
any
god
beside
thee
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
and
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
israel
whom
god
went
to
redeem
to
be
his
own
people
to
make
thee
a
name
of
greatness
and
terribleness
by
driving
out
nations
from
before
thy
people
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
out
of
egypt
for
thy
people
israel
didst
thou
make
thine
own
people
for
ever
and
thou
lord
becamest
their
god
therefore
now
lord
let
the
thing
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
be
established
for
ever
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
let
it
even
be
established
that
thy
name
may
be
magnified
for
ever
saying
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
god
of
israel
even
a
god
to
israel
and
let
the
house
of
david
thy
servant
be
established
before
thee
for
thou
o
my
god
hast
told
thy
servant
that
thou
wilt
build
him
an
house
therefore
thy
servant
hath
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
before
thee
and
now
lord
thou
art
god
and
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant
now
therefore
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant
that
it
may
be
before
thee
for
ever
for
thou
blessest
o
lord
and
it
shall
be
blessed
for
ever
now
after
this
it
came
to
pass
that
david
smote
the
philistines
and
subdued
them
and
took
gath
and
her
towns
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
he
smote
moab
and
the
moabites
became
david's
servants
and
brought
gifts
and
david
smote
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
unto
hamath
as
he
went
to
stablish
his
dominion
by
the
river
euphrates
and
david
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots
and
seven
thousand
horsemen
and
twenty
thousand
footmen
david
also
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses
but
reserved
of
them
an
hundred
chariots
and
when
the
syrians
of
damascus
came
to
help
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
david
slew
of
the
syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men
then
david
put
garrisons
in
syriadamascus
and
the
syrians
became
david's
servants
and
brought
gifts
thus
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
and
david
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
hadarezer
and
brought
them
to
jerusalem
likewise
from
tibhath
and
from
chun
cities
of
hadarezer
brought
david
very
much
brass
wherewith
solomon
made
the
brasen
sea
and
the
pillars
and
the
vessels
of
brass
now
when
tou
king
of
hamath
heard
how
david
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
hadarezer
king
of
zobah
he
sent
hadoram
his
son
to
king
david
to
enquire
of
his
welfare
and
to
congratulate
him
because
he
had
fought
against
hadarezer
and
smitten
him
for
hadarezer
had
war
with
tou
and
with
him
all
manner
of
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass
them
also
king
david
dedicated
unto
the
lord
with
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
he
brought
from
all
these
nations
from
edom
and
from
moab
and
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
from
the
philistines
and
from
amalek
moreover
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
slew
of
the
edomites
in
the
valley
of
salt
eighteen
thousand
and
he
put
garrisons
in
edom
and
all
the
edomites
became
david's
servants
thus
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
so
david
reigned
over
all
israel
and
executed
judgment
and
justice
among
all
his
people
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
over
the
host
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
recorder
and
zadok
the
son
of
ahitub
and
abimelech
the
son
of
abiathar
were
the
priests
and
shavsha
was
scribe
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
was
over
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
the
sons
of
david
were
chief
about
the
king
now
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
died
and
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
david
said
i
will
shew
kindness
unto
hanun
the
son
of
nahash
because
his
father
shewed
kindness
to
me
and
david
sent
messengers
to
comfort
him
concerning
his
father
so
the
servants
of
david
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
to
hanun
to
comfort
him
but
the
princes
of
the
children
of
ammon
said
to
hanun
thinkest
thou
that
david
doth
honour
thy
father
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee
are
not
his
servants
come
unto
thee
for
to
search
and
to
overthrow
and
to
spy
out
the
land
wherefore
hanun
took
david's
servants
and
shaved
them
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
midst
hard
by
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
then
there
went
certain
and
told
david
how
the
men
were
served
and
he
sent
to
meet
them
for
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed
and
the
king
said
tarry
at
jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown
and
then
return
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
they
had
made
themselves
odious
to
david
hanun
and
the
children
of
ammon
sent
a
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
hire
them
chariots
and
horsemen
out
of
mesopotamia
and
out
of
syriamaachah
and
out
of
zobah
so
they
hired
thirty
and
two
thousand
chariots
and
the
king
of
maachah
and
his
people
who
came
and
pitched
before
medeba
and
the
children
of
ammon
gathered
themselves
together
from
their
cities
and
came
to
battle
and
when
david
heard
of
it
he
sent
joab
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men
and
the
children
of
ammon
came
out
and
put
the
battle
in
array
before
the
gate
of
the
city
and
the
kings
that
were
come
were
by
themselves
in
the
field
now
when
joab
saw
that
the
battle
was
set
against
him
before
and
behind
he
chose
out
of
all
the
choice
of
israel
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
syrians
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
unto
the
hand
of
abishai
his
brother
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
he
said
if
the
syrians
be
too
strong
for
me
then
thou
shalt
help
me
but
if
the
children
of
ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee
then
i
will
help
thee
be
of
good
courage
and
let
us
behave
ourselves
valiantly
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
god
and
let
the
lord
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
sight
so
joab
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
drew
nigh
before
the
syrians
unto
the
battle
and
they
fled
before
him
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
the
syrians
were
fled
they
likewise
fled
before
abishai
his
brother
and
entered
into
the
city
then
joab
came
to
jerusalem
and
when
the
syrians
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
they
sent
messengers
and
drew
forth
the
syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river
and
shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
hadarezer
went
before
them
and
it
was
told
david
and
he
gathered
all
israel
and
passed
over
jordan
and
came
upon
them
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
them
so
when
david
had
put
the
battle
in
array
against
the
syrians
they
fought
with
him
but
the
syrians
fled
before
israel
and
david
slew
of
the
syrians
seven
thousand
men
which
fought
in
chariots
and
forty
thousand
footmen
and
killed
shophach
the
captain
of
the
host
and
when
the
servants
of
hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
they
made
peace
with
david
and
became
his
servants
neither
would
the
syrians
help
the
children
of
ammon
any
more
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
year
was
expired
at
the
time
that
kings
go
out
to
battle
joab
led
forth
the
power
of
the
army
and
wasted
the
country
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
came
and
besieged
rabbah
but
david
tarried
at
jerusalem
and
joab
smote
rabbah
and
destroyed
it
and
david
took
the
crown
of
their
king
from
off
his
head
and
found
it
to
weigh
a
talent
of
gold
and
there
were
precious
stones
in
it
and
it
was
set
upon
david's
head
and
he
brought
also
exceeding
much
spoil
out
of
the
city
and
he
brought
out
the
people
that
were
in
it
and
cut
them
with
saws
and
with
harrows
of
iron
and
with
axes
even
so
dealt
david
with
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
david
and
all
the
people
returned
to
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
there
arose
war
at
gezer
with
the
philistines
at
which
time
sibbechai
the
hushathite
slew
sippai
that
was
of
the
children
of
the
giant
and
they
were
subdued
and
there
was
war
again
with
the
philistines
and
elhanan
the
son
of
jair
slew
lahmi
the
brother
of
goliath
the
gittite
whose
spear
staff
was
like
a
weaver's
beam
and
yet
again
there
was
war
at
gath
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature
whose
fingers
and
toes
were
four
and
twenty
six
on
each
hand
and
six
on
each
foot
and
he
also
was
the
son
of
the
giant
but
when
he
defied
israel
jonathan
the
son
of
shimea
david's
brother
slew
him
these
were
born
unto
the
giant
in
gath
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
david
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
satan
stood
up
against
israel
and
provoked
david
to
number
israel
and
david
said
to
joab
and
to
the
rulers
of
the
people
go
number
israel
from
beersheba
even
to
dan
and
bring
the
number
of
them
to
me
that
i
may
know
it
and
joab
answered
the
lord
make
his
people
an
hundred
times
so
many
more
as
they
be
but
my
lord
the
king
are
they
not
all
my
lord's
servants
why
then
doth
my
lord
require
this
thing
why
will
he
be
a
cause
of
trespass
to
israel
nevertheless
the
king's
word
prevailed
against
joab
wherefore
joab
departed
and
went
throughout
all
israel
and
came
to
jerusalem
and
joab
gave
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
david
and
all
they
of
israel
were
a
thousand
thousand
and
an
hundred
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
and
judah
was
four
hundred
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
that
drew
sword
but
levi
and
benjamin
counted
he
not
among
them
for
the
king's
word
was
abominable
to
joab
and
god
was
displeased
with
this
thing
therefore
he
smote
israel
and
david
said
unto
god
i
have
sinned
greatly
because
i
have
done
this
thing
but
now
i
beseech
thee
do
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant
for
i
have
done
very
foolishly
and
the
lord
spake
unto
gad
david's
seer
saying
go
and
tell
david
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
offer
thee
three
things
choose
thee
one
of
them
that
i
may
do
it
unto
thee
so
gad
came
to
david
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
choose
thee
either
three
years
famine
or
three
months
to
be
destroyed
before
thy
foes
while
that
the
sword
of
thine
enemies
overtaketh
thee
or
else
three
days
the
sword
of
the
lord
even
the
pestilence
in
the
land
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
destroying
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
now
therefore
advise
thyself
what
word
i
shall
bring
again
to
him
that
sent
me
and
david
said
unto
gad
i
am
in
a
great
strait
let
me
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
lord
for
very
great
are
his
mercies
but
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
so
the
lord
sent
pestilence
upon
israel
and
there
fell
of
israel
seventy
thousand
men
and
god
sent
an
angel
unto
jerusalem
to
destroy
it
and
as
he
was
destroying
the
lord
beheld
and
he
repented
him
of
the
evil
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed
it
is
enough
stay
now
thine
hand
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
stood
by
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
and
david
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
angel
of
the
lord
stand
between
the
earth
and
the
heaven
having
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
stretched
out
over
jerusalem
then
david
and
the
elders
of
israel
who
were
clothed
in
sackcloth
fell
upon
their
faces
and
david
said
unto
god
is
it
not
i
that
commanded
the
people
to
be
numbered
even
i
it
is
that
have
sinned
and
done
evil
indeed
but
as
for
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thine
hand
i
pray
thee
o
lord
my
god
be
on
me
and
on
my
father's
house
but
not
on
thy
people
that
they
should
be
plagued
then
the
angel
of
the
lord
commanded
gad
to
say
to
david
that
david
should
go
up
and
set
up
an
altar
unto
the
lord
in
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
and
david
went
up
at
the
saying
of
gad
which
he
spake
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
ornan
turned
back
and
saw
the
angel
and
his
four
sons
with
him
hid
themselves
now
ornan
was
threshing
wheat
and
as
david
came
to
ornan
ornan
looked
and
saw
david
and
went
out
of
the
threshingfloor
and
bowed
himself
to
david
with
his
face
to
the
ground
then
david
said
to
ornan
grant
me
the
place
of
this
threshingfloor
that
i
may
build
an
altar
therein
unto
the
lord
thou
shalt
grant
it
me
for
the
full
price
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people
and
ornan
said
unto
david
take
it
to
thee
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
that
which
is
good
in
his
eyes
lo
i
give
thee
the
oxen
also
for
burnt
offerings
and
the
threshing
instruments
for
wood
and
the
wheat
for
the
meat
offering
i
give
it
all
and
king
david
said
to
ornan
nay
but
i
will
verily
buy
it
for
the
full
price
for
i
will
not
take
that
which
is
thine
for
the
lord
nor
offer
burnt
offerings
without
cost
so
david
gave
to
ornan
for
the
place
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
by
weight
and
david
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
and
called
upon
the
lord
and
he
answered
him
from
heaven
by
fire
upon
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
the
lord
commanded
the
angel
and
he
put
up
his
sword
again
into
the
sheath
thereof
at
that
time
when
david
saw
that
the
lord
had
answered
him
in
the
threshingfloor
of
ornan
the
jebusite
then
he
sacrificed
there
for
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
which
moses
made
in
the
wilderness
and
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
were
at
that
season
in
the
high
place
at
gibeon
but
david
could
not
go
before
it
to
enquire
of
god
for
he
was
afraid
because
of
the
sword
of
the
angel
of
the
lord
then
david
said
this
is
the
house
of
the
lord
god
and
this
is
the
altar
of
the
burnt
offering
for
israel
and
david
commanded
to
gather
together
the
strangers
that
were
in
the
land
of
israel
and
he
set
masons
to
hew
wrought
stones
to
build
the
house
of
god
and
david
prepared
iron
in
abundance
for
the
nails
for
the
doors
of
the
gates
and
for
the
joinings
and
brass
in
abundance
without
weight
also
cedar
trees
in
abundance
for
the
zidonians
and
they
of
tyre
brought
much
cedar
wood
to
david
and
david
said
solomon
my
son
is
young
and
tender
and
the
house
that
is
to
be
builded
for
the
lord
must
be
exceeding
magnifical
of
fame
and
of
glory
throughout
all
countries
i
will
therefore
now
make
preparation
for
it
so
david
prepared
abundantly
before
his
death
then
he
called
for
solomon
his
son
and
charged
him
to
build
an
house
for
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
david
said
to
solomon
my
son
as
for
me
it
was
in
my
mind
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
but
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
thou
hast
shed
blood
abundantly
and
hast
made
great
wars
thou
shalt
not
build
an
house
unto
my
name
because
thou
hast
shed
much
blood
upon
the
earth
in
my
sight
behold
a
son
shall
be
born
to
thee
who
shall
be
a
man
of
rest
and
i
will
give
him
rest
from
all
his
enemies
round
about
for
his
name
shall
be
solomon
and
i
will
give
peace
and
quietness
unto
israel
in
his
days
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
he
shall
be
my
son
and
i
will
be
his
father
and
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
over
israel
for
ever
now
my
son
the
lord
be
with
thee
and
prosper
thou
and
build
the
house
of
the
lord
thy
god
as
he
hath
said
of
thee
only
the
lord
give
thee
wisdom
and
understanding
and
give
thee
charge
concerning
israel
that
thou
mayest
keep
the
law
of
the
lord
thy
god
then
shalt
thou
prosper
if
thou
takest
heed
to
fulfil
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
the
lord
charged
moses
with
concerning
israel
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
dread
not
nor
be
dismayed
now
behold
in
my
trouble
i
have
prepared
for
the
house
of
the
lord
an
hundred
thousand
talents
of
gold
and
a
thousand
thousand
talents
of
silver
and
of
brass
and
iron
without
weight
for
it
is
in
abundance
timber
also
and
stone
have
i
prepared
and
thou
mayest
add
thereto
moreover
there
are
workmen
with
thee
in
abundance
hewers
and
workers
of
stone
and
timber
and
all
manner
of
cunning
men
for
every
manner
of
work
of
the
gold
the
silver
and
the
brass
and
the
iron
there
is
no
number
arise
therefore
and
be
doing
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
david
also
commanded
all
the
princes
of
israel
to
help
solomon
his
son
saying
is
not
the
lord
your
god
with
you
and
hath
he
not
given
you
rest
on
every
side
for
he
hath
given
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
mine
hand
and
the
land
is
subdued
before
the
lord
and
before
his
people
now
set
your
heart
and
your
soul
to
seek
the
lord
your
god
arise
therefore
and
build
ye
the
sanctuary
of
the
lord
god
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
the
holy
vessels
of
god
into
the
house
that
is
to
be
built
to
the
name
of
the
lord
so
when
david
was
old
and
full
of
days
he
made
solomon
his
son
king
over
israel
and
he
gathered
together
all
the
princes
of
israel
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
now
the
levites
were
numbered
from
the
age
of
thirty
years
and
upward
and
their
number
by
their
polls
man
by
man
was
thirty
and
eight
thousand
of
which
twenty
and
four
thousand
were
to
set
forward
the
work
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
six
thousand
were
officers
and
judges
moreover
four
thousand
were
porters
and
four
thousand
praised
the
lord
with
the
instruments
which
i
made
said
david
to
praise
therewith
and
david
divided
them
into
courses
among
the
sons
of
levi
namely
gershon
kohath
and
merari
of
the
gershonites
were
laadan
and
shimei
the
sons
of
laadan
the
chief
was
jehiel
and
zetham
and
joel
three
the
sons
of
shimei
shelomith
and
haziel
and
haran
three
these
were
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
laadan
and
the
sons
of
shimei
were
jahath
zina
and
jeush
and
beriah
these
four
were
the
sons
of
shimei
and
jahath
was
the
chief
and
zizah
the
second
but
jeush
and
beriah
had
not
many
sons
therefore
they
were
in
one
reckoning
according
to
their
father's
house
the
sons
of
kohath
amram
izhar
hebron
and
uzziel
four
the
sons
of
amram
aaron
and
moses
and
aaron
was
separated
that
he
should
sanctify
the
most
holy
things
he
and
his
sons
for
ever
to
burn
incense
before
the
lord
to
minister
unto
him
and
to
bless
in
his
name
for
ever
now
concerning
moses
the
man
of
god
his
sons
were
named
of
the
tribe
of
levi
the
sons
of
moses
were
gershom
and
eliezer
of
the
sons
of
gershom
shebuel
was
the
chief
and
the
sons
of
eliezer
were
rehabiah
the
chief
and
eliezer
had
none
other
sons
but
the
sons
of
rehabiah
were
very
many
of
the
sons
of
izhar
shelomith
the
chief
of
the
sons
of
hebron
jeriah
the

amariah
the

micah
the

and
jesiah
the
second
the
sons
of
merari
mahli
and
mushi
the
sons
of
mahli
eleazar
and
kish
and
eleazar
died
and
had
no
sons
but
daughters
and
their
brethren
the
sons
of
kish
took
them
the
sons
of
mushi
mahli
and
eder
and
jeremoth
three
these
were
the
sons
of
levi
after
the
house
of
their
fathers
even
the
chief
of
the
fathers
as
they
were
counted
by
number
of
names
by
their
polls
that
did
the
work
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
from
the
age
of
twenty
years
and
upward
for
david
said
the
lord
god
of
israel
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
that
they
may
dwell
in
jerusalem
for
ever
and
also
unto
the
levites
they
shall
no
more
carry
the
tabernacle
nor
any
vessels
of
it
for
the
service
thereof
for
by
the
last
words
of
david
the
levites
were
numbered
from
twenty
years
old
and
above
because
their
office
was
to
wait
on
the
sons
of
aaron
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
in
the
courts
and
in
the
chambers
and
in
the
purifying
of
all
holy
things
and
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
god
both
for
the
shewbread
and
for
the
fine
flour
for
meat
offering
and
for
the
unleavened
cakes
and
for
that
which
is
baked
in
the
pan
and
for
that
which
is
fried
and
for
all
manner
of
measure
and
size
and
to
stand
every
morning
to
thank
and
praise
the
lord
and
likewise
at
even
and
to
offer
all
burnt
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
in
the
sabbaths
in
the
new
moons
and
on
the
set
feasts
by
number
according
to
the
order
commanded
unto
them
continually
before
the
lord
and
that
they
should
keep
the
charge
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
the
charge
of
the
holy
place
and
the
charge
of
the
sons
of
aaron
their
brethren
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
the

now
these
are
the
divisions
of
the

of
aaron
the

aaron
nadab
and
abihu
eleazar
and
ithamar
but
nadab
and
abihu
died
before
their

and
had
no

therefore
eleazar
and
ithamar
executed
the

and
david
distributed
them
both

the

of
eleazar
and

according

and
there
were

there
were

chief
men
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
eight

of

according
to

thus
were
they
divided

one
sort
with
another
for
the

of
the

and
governors
of
the

of

god
said
unto

thou

because
thou
hast
been
a
man
of

and
hast
shed

the
lord
god
of

chose
me
before
all

for
ever
for
he
hath
chosen
judah
to
be
the

and
of
the
house
of

the
house
of
my

and
among
the

of
my

he
liked
me
to
make
me
king
over

hath
given
me
many

he
hath
chosen
solomon
my
son
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom

he
said
unto

solomon
thy

he
shall
build

for
i
have
chosen
him
to

know
thou
the

if

o

and
of

our
fathers
keep
this
for
ever
in
the
imagination
of
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
of
thy
people
and
prepare
their
heart
unto
thee
and
give
unto
solomon
my
son
a

and
to

all
these
things
and
to
build
the
palace
for
the
which
i
have
made
provision
and
david
said
to
all
the
congregation
now
bless
the
lord
your
god
and
all
the
congregation
blessed
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
bowed
down
their
heads
and
worshipped
the
lord
and
the
king
and
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
on
the
morrow
after
that
day
even
a
thousand
bullocks
a
thousand
rams
and
a
thousand
lambs
with
their
drink
offerings
and
sacrifices
in
abundance
for
all
israel
and
did
eat
and
drink
before
the
lord
on
that
day
with
great
gladness
and
they
made
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
the
second
time
and
anointed
him
unto
the
lord
to
be
the
chief
governor
and
zadok
to
be
priest
then
solomon
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
lord
as
king
instead
of
david
his
father
and
prospered
and
all
israel
obeyed
him
and
all
the
princes
and
the
mighty
men
and
all
the
sons
likewise
of
king
david
submitted
themselves
unto
solomon
the
king
and
the
lord
magnified
solomon
exceedingly
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
and
bestowed
upon
him
such
royal
majesty
as
had
not
been
on
any
king
before
him
in
israel
thus
david
the
son
of
jesse
reigned
over
all
israel
and
the
time
that
he
reigned
over
israel
was
forty
years
seven
years
reigned
he
in
hebron
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
he
died
in
a
good
old
age
full
of
days
riches
and
honour
and
solomon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
now
the
acts
of
david
the
king
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
samuel
the
seer
and
in
the
book
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
in
the
book
of
gad
the
seer
with
all
his
reign
and
his
might
and
the
times
that
went
over
him
and
over
israel
and
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries
the
second
book
of
the
chronicles
and
solomon
the
son
of
david
was
strengthened
in
his
kingdom
and
the
lord
his
god
was
with
him
and
magnified
him
exceedingly
then
solomon
spake
unto
all
israel
to
the
captains
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds
and
to
the
judges
and
to
every
governor
in
all
israel
the
chief
of
the
fathers
so
solomon
and
all
the
congregation
with
him
went
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
gibeon
for
there
was
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
of
god
which
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
had
made
in
the
wilderness
but
the
ark
of
god
had
david
brought
up
from
kirjathjearim
to
the
place
which
david
had
prepared
for
it
for
he
had
pitched
a
tent
for
it
at
jerusalem
moreover
the
brasen
altar
that
bezaleel
the
son
of
uri
the
son
of
hur
had
made
he
put
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
solomon
and
the
congregation
sought
unto
it
and
solomon
went
up
thither
to
the
brasen
altar
before
the
lord
which
was
at
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
offered
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
upon
it
in
that
night
did
god
appear
unto
solomon
and
said
unto
him
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
and
solomon
said
unto
god
thou
hast
shewed
great
mercy
unto
david
my
father
and
hast
made
me
to
reign
in
his
stead
now
o
lord
god
let
thy
promise
unto
david
my
father
be
established
for
thou
hast
made
me
king
over
a
people
like
the
dust
of
the
earth
in
multitude
give
me
now
wisdom
and
knowledge
that
i
may
go
out
and
come
in
before
this
people
for
who
can
judge
this
thy
people
that
is
so
great
and
god
said
to
solomon
because
this
was
in
thine
heart
and
thou
hast
not
asked
riches
wealth
or
honour
nor
the
life
of
thine
enemies
neither
yet
hast
asked
long
life
but
hast
asked
wisdom
and
knowledge
for
thyself
that
thou
mayest
judge
my
people
over
whom
i
have
made
thee
king
wisdom
and
knowledge
is
granted
unto
thee
and
i
will
give
thee
riches
and
wealth
and
honour
such
as
none
of
the
kings
have
had
that
have
been
before
thee
neither
shall
there
any
after
thee
have
the
like
then
solomon
came
from
his
journey
to
the
high
place
that
was
at
gibeon
to
jerusalem
from
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
reigned
over
israel
and
solomon
gathered
chariots
and
horsemen
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
which
he
placed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
with
the
king
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
made
silver
and
gold
at
jerusalem
as
plenteous
as
stones
and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
vale
for
abundance
and
solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
egypt
and
linen
yarn
the
king's
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a
price
and
they
fetched
up
and
brought
forth
out
of
egypt
a
chariot
for
six
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
so
brought
they
out
horses
for
all
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
for
the
kings
of
syria
by
their
means
and
solomon
determined
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
and
an
house
for
his
kingdom
and
solomon
told
out
threescore
and
ten
thousand
men
to
bear
burdens
and
fourscore
thousand
to
hew
in
the
mountain
and
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
to
oversee
them
and
solomon
sent
to
huram
the
king
of
tyre
saying
as
thou
didst
deal
with
david
my
father
and
didst
send
him

and
on
the
solemn
feasts
of
the

our

this
is
an
ordinance
for
ever
to
israel
and
the
house
which
i
build
is

for

to
build

then
huram
the

answered
in

which
he
sent
to
solomon
because
the
lord
hath
loved
his
people
he
hath
made
thee
king
over
them
huram
said
moreover
blessed

a

sound
to

and
praised
the

saying
for
he
is

was
filled
with
a
cloud
even
the
house
of
the

so
that
the

not
stand
to

by
reason
of

for
the
glory
of

thick
darkness
but
i
have
built
an
house
of
habitation
for

fulfilled
that
which
he
spake
with

house
in
that
my

might
be
there
neither

i
have
chosen
jerusalem
that
my
name
might
be
there
and
have
chosen
david
to
be
over
my
people
israel
now
it
was
in
the
heart
of
david
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
but
the
lord
said
to
david
my
father
forasmuch
as
it
was
in
thine
heart
to
build
an
house
for
my
name
thou
didst
well
in
that
it
was
in
thine
heart
notwithstanding
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
but
thy
son
which
shall
come
forth
out
of
thy
loins
he
shall
build
the
house
for
my

the
lord
therefore

of
the
lord
that
he
made
with
the
children
of
israel
and
he
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of

and
spread
forth
his
hands
for

of
five
cubits
long
and

cubits
broad
and
three
cubits
high
and
had
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
court
and
upon
it
he
stood
and
kneeled
down
upon
his
knees
before
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
no
god
like
thee
in
the
heaven
nor
in
the
earth
which
keepest
covenant
and
shewest
mercy
unto
thy
servants
that
walk
before
thee
with
all
their
hearts
thou
which
hast
kept
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him
and
spakest
with
thy
mouth
and
hast
fulfilled
it
with
thine
hand
as
it
is
this
day
now
therefore
o
lord
god
of
israel
keep
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
which
thou
hast
promised
him
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
in
my
sight
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
israel
yet
so
that
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
to
walk
in
my
law
as
thou
hast
walked
before
me
now
then
o
lord
god
of
israel
let
thy
word
be
verified
which
thou

cannot
contain
thee
how
much
less
this
house
which
i
have
built
have
respect
therefore
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
his
supplication
o
lord
my
god
to
hearken
unto
the
cry
and
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
before
thee
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
upon
this
house
day
and
night
upon
the
place
whereof
thou
hast
said
that
thou
wouldest
put
thy
name
there
to
hearken
unto
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
toward
this
place
hearken
therefore
unto
the
supplications
of
thy
servant
and
of
thy
people
israel
which
they
shall
make
toward
this
place
hear

from
thy
dwelling
place
even
from

and
an
oath
be
laid
upon
him
to
make
him
swear
and
the
oath
come
before
thine
altar
in
this
house
then
hear
thou
from
heaven
and
do
and
judge
thy
servants
by
requiting
the
wicked
by
recompensing
his
way
upon
his
own
head
and
by
justifying
the
righteous
by
giving
him
according
to
his
righteousness
and
if

people
israel
be
put
to
the
worse
before

land
which
thou
gavest
to
them
and
to
their
fathers
when
the
heaven
is
shut
up
and

is
no
rain
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
yet
if
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
confess
thy
name
and
turn
from
their
sin
when

dost
afflict
them
then
hear
thou
from
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
servants
and
of
thy
people
israel
when
thou
hast
taught
them
the
good
way
wherein
they
should
walk
and
send
rain
upon
thy
land
which
thou
hast
given
unto
thy
people
for
an
inheritance
if
there
be
dearth
in
the
land
if
there
be
pestilence
if
there
be

or
caterpillers
if
their

besiege
them
in
the
cities
of

be
then
what
prayer
or

supplication
soever
shall
be
made
of
any
man

when
every
one
shall
know
his

sore
and
his

and
render
unto
every
man
according
unto
all
his
ways
whose
heart
thou
knowest
for
thou
only
knowest
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
that
they
may
fear
thee
to
walk
in
thy
ways
so
long
as
they
live
in
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
moreover
concerning
the
stranger
which
is
not
of
thy
people
israel
but
is
come
from
a
far
country
for
thy
great
name's
sake
and
thy
mighty
hand
and
thy
stretched
out
arm
if

in
this
house
then
hear
thou
from

even
from
thy
dwelling
place
and
do
according
to
all
that
the
stranger
calleth
to
thee
for
that
all
people
of
the
earth
may
know
thy
name
and
fear
thee
as
doth
thy
people
israel
and
may
know
that
this
house
which
i
have
built
is
called
by
thy
name
if
thy
people
go
out
to
war
against
their
enemies
by
the
way
that
thou
shalt
send
them
and
they
pray
unto
thee
toward
this
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
and
maintain
their
cause
if
they
sin
against
thee
for
there
is
no
man
which
sinneth
not
and
thou
be
angry
with
them
and
deliver
them
over
before
their
enemies
and
they
carry
them
away
captives
unto
a
land
far
off
or
near
yet
if
they
bethink
themselves
in
the
land
whither
they
are
carried
captive
and
turn
and
pray
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
their
captivity
saying
we
have
sinned
we
have
done
amiss
and
have
dealt
wickedly
if
they
return
to
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
captivity
whither
they
have
carried
them
captives
and
pray
toward
their
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
and
toward
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
toward
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
then
hear
thou
from
the
heavens
even
from
thy
dwelling
place
their
prayer
and
their
supplications
and
maintain
their
cause
and
forgive
thy
people
which
have
sinned
against
thee
now
my
god
let
i
beseech
thee
thine
eyes
be
open
and
let
thine
ears
be
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place
now
therefore
arise
o
lord
god
into
thy
resting
place
thou
and
the
ark
of
thy
strength
let
thy
priests
o
lord
god
be
clothed
with
salvation
and
let
thy
saints
rejoice
in
goodness
o
lord
god
turn
not
away
the
face
of
thine
anointed
remember
the
mercies
of
david
thy
servant
now
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
the
fire
came
down
from
heaven
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifices
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
filled
the
house
and
the
priests
could
not
enter
into
the
house
of
the
lord
because
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
lord's
house
and
when
all
the
children
of
israel
saw
how
the
fire
came
down
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
upon
the
house
they
bowed
themselves
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
upon
the
pavement
and
worshipped
and
praised
the
lord
saying
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
then
the
king
and
all
the
people
offered
sacrifices
before
the
lord
and
king
solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
twenty
and
two
thousand
oxen
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep
so
the
king
and
all
the
people
dedicated
the
house
of
god
and
the
priests
waited
on
their
offices
the
levites
also
with
instruments
of
musick
of
the
lord
which
david
the
king
had
made
to
praise
the
lord
because
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
when
david
praised
by
their
ministry
and
the
priests
sounded
trumpets
before
them
and
all
israel
stood
moreover
solomon
hallowed
the
middle
of
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
of
the
lord
for
there
he
offered
burnt
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
because
the
brasen
altar
which
solomon
had
made
was
not
able
to
receive
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
also
at
the
same
time
solomon
kept
the
feast
seven
days
and
all
israel
with
him
a
very
great
congregation
from
the
entering
in
of
hamath
unto
the
river
of
egypt
and
in
the
eighth
day
they
made
a
solemn
assembly
for
they
kept
the
dedication
of
the
altar
seven
days
and
the
feast
seven
days
and
on
the
three
and
twentieth
day
of
the
seventh
month
he
sent
the
people
away
into
their
tents
glad
and
merry
in
heart
for
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
shewed
unto
david
and
to
solomon
and
to
israel
his
people
thus
solomon
finished
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king's
house
and
all
that
came
into
solomon's
heart
to
make
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
his
own
house
he
prosperously
effected
and
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
by
night
and
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
have
chosen
this
place
to
myself
for
an
house
of
sacrifice
if
i
shut
up
heaven
that
there
be
no
rain
or
if
i
command
the
locusts
to
devour
the
land
or
if
i
send
pestilence
among
my
people
if
my
people
which
are
called
by
my
name
shall
humble
themselves
and
pray
and
seek
my
face
and
turn
from
their
wicked
ways
then
will
i
hear
from
heaven
and
will
forgive
their
sin
and
will
heal
their
land
now
mine
eyes
shall
be
open
and
mine
ears
attent
unto
the
prayer
that
is
made
in
this
place
for
now
have
i
chosen
and
sanctified
this
house
that
my
name
may
be
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
and
as
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
david
thy
father
walked
and
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
shalt
observe
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
then
will
i
stablish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
according
as
i
have
covenanted
with
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
to
be
ruler
in
israel
but
if
ye
turn
away
and
forsake
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
which
i
have
set
before
you
and
shall
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
then
will
i
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
out
of
my
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
sanctified
for
my
name
will
i
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
will
make
it
to
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
nations
and
this
house
which
is
high
shall
be
an
astonishment
to
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
so
that
he
shall
say
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
unto
this
house
and
it
shall
be
answered
because
they
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
laid
hold
on
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
he
brought
all
this
evil
upon
them
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
wherein
solomon
had
built
the
house
of
the
lord
and
his
own
house
that
the
cities
which
huram
had
restored
to
solomon
solomon
built
them
and
caused
the
children
of
israel
to
dwell
there
and
solomon
went
to
hamathzobah
and
prevailed
against
it
and
he
built
tadmor
in
the
wilderness
and
all
the
store
cities
which
he
built
in
hamath
also
he
built
bethhoron
the
upper
and
bethhoron
the
nether
fenced
cities
with
walls
gates
and
bars
and
baalath
and
all
the
store
cities
that
solomon
had
and
all
the
chariot
cities
and
the
cities
of
the
horsemen
and
all
that
solomon
desired
to
build
in
jerusalem
and
in
lebanon
and
throughout
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
as
for
all
the
people
that
were
left
of
the
hittites
and
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
hivites
and
the
jebusites
which
were
not
of
israel
but
of
their
children
who
were
left
after
them
in
the
land
whom
the
children
of
israel
consumed
not
them
did
solomon
make
to
pay
tribute
until
this
day
but
of
the
children
of
israel
did
solomon
make
no
servants
for
his
work
but
they
were
men
of
war
and
chief
of
his
captains
and
captains
of
his
chariots
and
horsemen
and
these
were
the
chief
of
king
solomon's
officers
even
two
hundred
and
fifty
that
bare
rule
over
the
people
and
solomon
brought
up
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
out
of
the
city
of
david
unto
the
house
that
he
had
built
for
her
for
he
said
my
wife
shall
not
dwell
in
the
house
of
david
king
of
israel
because
the
places
are
holy
whereunto
the
ark
of
the
lord
hath
come
then
solomon
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
on
the
altar
of
the
lord
which
he
had
built
before
the
porch
even
after
a
certain
rate
every
day
offering
according
to
the
commandment
of
moses
on
the
sabbaths
and
on
the
new
moons
and
on
the
solemn
feasts
three
times
in
the
year
even
in
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
and
in
the
feast
of
weeks
and
in
the
feast
of
tabernacles
and
he
appointed
according
to
the
order
of
david
his
father
the
courses
of
the
priests
to
their
service
and
the
levites
to
their
charges
to
praise
and
minister
before
the
priests
as
the
duty
of
every
day
required
the
porters
also
by
their
courses
at
every
gate
for
so
had
david
the
man
of
god
commanded
and
they
departed
not
from
the
commandment
of
the
king
unto
the
priests
and
levites
concerning
any
matter
or
concerning
the
treasures
now
all
the
work
of
solomon
was
prepared
unto
the
day
of
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
until
it
was
finished
so
the
house
of
the
lord
was
perfected
then
went
solomon
to
eziongeber
and
to
eloth
at
the
sea
side
in
the
land
of
edom
and
huram
sent
him
by
the
hands
of
his
servants
ships
and
servants
that
had
knowledge
of
the
sea
and
they
went
with
the
servants
of
solomon
to
ophir
and
took
thence
four
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
gold
and
brought
them
to
king
solomon
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
heard
of
the
fame
of
solomon
she
came
to
prove
solomon
with
hard
questions
at
jerusalem
with
a
very
great
company
and
camels
that
bare
spices
and
gold
in
abundance
and
precious
stones
and
when
she
was
come
to
solomon
she
communed
with
him
of
all
that
was
in
her
heart
and
solomon
told
her
all
her
questions
and
there
was
nothing
hid
from
solomon
which
he
told
her
not
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
had
seen
the
wisdom
of
solomon
and
the
house
that
he
had
built
and
the
meat
of
his
table
and
the
sitting
of
his
servants
and
the
attendance
of
his
ministers
and
their
apparel
his
cupbearers
also
and
their
apparel
and
his
ascent
by
which
he
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her
and
she
said
to
the
king
it
was
a
true
report
which
i
heard
in
mine
own
land
of
thine
acts
and
of
thy
wisdom
howbeit
i
believed
not
their
words
until
i
came
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
it
and
behold
the
one
half
of
the
greatness
of
thy
wisdom
was
not
told
me
for
thou
exceedest
the
fame
that
i
heard
happy
are
thy
men
and
happy
are
these
thy
servants
which
stand
continually
before
thee
and
hear
thy
wisdom
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
delighted
in
thee
to
set
thee
on
his
throne
to
be
king
for
the
lord
thy
god
because
thy
god
loved
israel
to
establish
them
for
ever
therefore
made
he
thee
king
over
them
to
do
judgment
and
justice
and
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of
gold
and
of
spices
great
abundance
and
precious
stones
neither
was
there
any
such
spice
as
the
queen
of
sheba
gave
king
solomon
and
the
servants
also
of
huram
and
the
servants
of
solomon
which
brought
gold
from
ophir
brought
algum
trees
and
precious
stones
and
the
king
made
of
the
algum
trees
terraces
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
to
the
king's
palace
and
harps
and
psalteries
for
singers
and
there
were
none
such
seen
before
in
the
land
of
judah
and
king
solomon
gave
to
the
queen
of
sheba
all
her
desire
whatsoever
she
asked
beside
that
which
she
had
brought
unto
the
king
so
she
turned
and
went
away
to
her
own
land
she
and
her
servants
now
the
weight
of
gold
that
came
to
solomon
in
one
year
was
six
hundred
and
threescore
and
six
talents
of
gold
beside
that
which
chapmen
and
merchants
brought
and
all
the
kings
of
arabia
and
governors
of
the
country
brought
gold
and
silver
to
solomon
and
king
solomon
made
two
hundred
targets
of
beaten
gold
six
hundred
shekels
of
beaten
gold
went
to
one
target
and
three
hundred
shields
made
he
of
beaten
gold
three
hundred
shekels
of
gold
went
to
one
shield
and
the
king
put
them
in
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
moreover
the
king
made
a
great
throne
of
ivory
and
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
and
there
were
six
steps
to
the
throne
with
a
footstool
of
gold
which
were
fastened
to
the
throne
and
stays
on
each
side
of
the
sitting
place
and
two
lions
standing
by
the
stays
and
twelve
lions
stood
there
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
six
steps
there
was
not
the
like
made
in
any
kingdom
and
all
the
drinking
vessels
of
king
solomon
were
of
gold
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
were
of
pure
gold
none
were
of
silver
it
was
not
any
thing
accounted
of
in
the
days
of
solomon
for
the
king's
ships
went
to
tarshish
with
the
servants
of
huram
every
three
years
once
came
the
ships
of
tarshish
bringing
gold
and
silver
ivory
and
apes
and
peacocks
and
king
solomon
passed
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
in
riches
and
wisdom
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
sought
the
presence
of
solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
that
god
had
put
in
his
heart
and
they
brought
every
man
his
present
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
and
raiment
harness
and
spices
horses
and
mules
a
rate
year
by
year
and
solomon
had
four
thousand
stalls
for
horses
and
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
whom
he
bestowed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
with
the
king
at
jerusalem
and
he
reigned
over
all
the
kings
from
the
river
even
unto
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
to
the
border
of
egypt
and
the
king
made
silver
in
jerusalem
as
stones
and
cedar
trees
made
he
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
low
plains
in
abundance
and
they
brought
unto
solomon
horses
out
of
egypt
and
out
of
all
lands
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
solomon
first
and
last
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
in
the
prophecy
of
ahijah
the
shilonite
and
in
the
visions
of
iddo
the
seer
against
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
solomon
reigned
in
jerusalem
over
all
israel
forty
years
and
solomon
slept
with
his
fathers
and
he
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
rehoboam
went
to
shechem
for
to
shechem
were
all
israel
come
to
make
him
king
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
was
in
egypt
whither
he
fled
from
the
presence
of
solomon
the
king
heard
it
that
jeroboam
returned
out
of
egypt
and
they
sent
and
called
him
so
jeroboam
and
all
israel
came
and
spake
to
rehoboam
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous
now
therefore
ease
thou
somewhat
the
grievous
servitude
of
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
that
he
put
upon
us
and
we
will
serve
thee
and
he
said
unto
them
come
again
unto
me
after
three
days
and
the
people
departed
and
king
rehoboam
took
counsel
with
the
old
men
that
had
stood
before
solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
lived
saying
what
counsel
give
ye
me
to
return
answer
to
this
people
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
if
thou
be
kind
to
this
people
and
please
them
and
speak
good
words
to
them
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
ever
but
he
forsook
the
counsel
which
the
old
men
gave
him
and
took
counsel
with
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
that
stood
before
him
and
he
said
unto
them
what
advice
give
ye
that
we
may
return
answer
to
this
people
which
have
spoken
to
me
saying
ease
somewhat
the
yoke
that
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
and
the
young
men
that
were
brought
up
with
him
spake
unto
him
saying
thus
shalt
thou
answer
the
people
that
spake
unto
thee
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
make
thou
it
somewhat
lighter
for
us
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
my
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father's
loins
for
whereas
my
father
put
a
heavy
yoke
upon
you
i
will
put
more
to
your
yoke
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
so
jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
rehoboam
on
the
third
day
as
the
king
bade
saying
come
again
to
me
on
the
third
day
and
the
king
answered
them
roughly
and
king
rehoboam
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
men
and
answered
them
after
the
advice
of
the
young
men
saying
my
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
but
i
will
add
thereto
my
father
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
so
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
for
the
cause
was
of
god
that
the
lord
might
perform
his
word
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
ahijah
the
shilonite
to
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
when
all
israel
saw
that
the
king
would
not
hearken
unto
them
the
people
answered
the
king
saying
what
portion
have
we
in
david
and
we
have
none
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
every
man
to
your
tents
o
israel
and
now
david
see
to
thine
own
house
so
all
israel
went
to
their
tents
but
as
for
the
children
of
israel
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
rehoboam
reigned
over
them
then
king
rehoboam
sent
hadoram
that
was
over
the
tribute
and
the
children
of
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
but
king
rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
chariot
to
flee
to
jerusalem
and
israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
david
unto
this
day
and
when
rehoboam
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
gathered
of
the
house
of
judah
and
benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men
which
were
warriors
to
fight
against
israel
that
he
might
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
rehoboam
but
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
shemaiah
the
man
of
god
saying
speak
unto
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
king
of
judah
and
to
all
israel
in
judah
and
benjamin
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
go
up
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
return
every
man
to
his
house
for
this
thing
is
done
of
me
and
they
obeyed
the
words
of
the
lord
and
returned
from
going
against
jeroboam
and
rehoboam
dwelt
in
jerusalem
and
built
cities
for
defence
in
judah
he
built
even
bethlehem
and
etam
and
tekoa
and
bethzur
and
shoco
and
adullam
and
gath
and
mareshah
and
ziph
and
adoraim
and
lachish
and
azekah
and
zorah
and
aijalon
and
hebron
which
are
in
judah
and
in
benjamin
fenced
cities
and
he
fortified
the
strong
holds
and
put
captains
in
them
and
store
of
victual
and
of
oil
and
wine
and
in
every
several
city
he
put
shields
and
spears
and
made
them
exceeding
strong
having
judah
and
benjamin
on
his
side
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
that
were
in
all
israel
resorted
to
him
out
of
all
their
coasts
for
the
levites
left
their
suburbs
and
their
possession
and
came
to
judah
and
jerusalem
for
jeroboam
and
his
sons
had
cast
them
off
from
executing
the
priest's
office
unto
the
lord
and
he
ordained
him
priests
for
the
high
places
and
for
the
devils
and
for
the
calves
which
he
had
made
and
after
them
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
such
as
set
their
hearts
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
israel
came
to
jerusalem
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
so
they
strengthened
the
kingdom
of
judah
and
made
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
strong
three
years
for
three
years
they
walked
in
the
way
of
david
and
solomon
and
rehoboam
took
him
mahalath
the
daughter
of
jerimoth
the
son
of
david
to
wife
and
abihail
the
daughter
of
eliab
the
son
of
jesse
which
bare
him
children
jeush
and
shamariah
and
zaham
and
after
her
he
took
maachah
the
daughter
of
absalom
which
bare
him
abijah
and
attai
and
ziza
and
shelomith
and
rehoboam
loved
maachah
the
daughter
of
absalom
above
all
his
wives
and
his
concubines
for
he
took
eighteen
wives
and
threescore
concubines
and
begat
twenty
and
eight
sons
and
threescore
daughters
and
rehoboam
made
abijah
the
son
of
maachah
the
chief
to
be
ruler
among
his
brethren
for
he
thought
to
make
him
king
and
he
dealt
wisely
and
dispersed
of
all
his
children
throughout
all
the
countries
of
judah
and
benjamin
unto
every
fenced
city
and
he
gave
them
victual
in
abundance
and
he
desired
many
wives
and
it
came
to
pass
when
rehoboam
had
established
the
kingdom
and
had
strengthened
himself
he
forsook
the
law
of
the
lord
and
all
israel
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
rehoboam
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
because
they
had
transgressed
against
the
lord
with
twelve
hundred
chariots
and
threescore
thousand
horsemen
and
the
people
were
without
number
that
came
with
him
out
of
egypt
the
lubims
the
sukkiims
and
the
ethiopians
and
he
took
the
fenced
cities
which
pertained
to
judah
and
came
to
jerusalem
then
came
shemaiah
the
prophet
to
rehoboam
and
to
the
princes
of
judah
that
were
gathered
together
to
jerusalem
because
of
shishak
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
forsaken
me
and
therefore
have
i
also
left
you
in
the
hand
of
shishak
whereupon
the
princes
of
israel
and
the
king
humbled
themselves
and
they
said
the
lord
is
righteous
and
when
the
lord
saw
that
they
humbled
themselves
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
shemaiah
saying
they
have
humbled
themselves
therefore
i
will
not
destroy
them
but
i
will
grant
them
some
deliverance
and
my
wrath
shall
not
be
poured
out
upon
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
shishak
nevertheless
they
shall
be
his
servants
that
they
may
know
my
service
and
the
service
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
countries
so
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
and
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
he
took
all
he
carried
away
also
the
shields
of
gold
which
solomon
had
made
instead
of
which
king
rehoboam
made
shields
of
brass
and
committed
them
to
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
that
kept
the
entrance
of
the
king's
house
and
when
the
king
entered
into
the
house
of
the
lord
the
guard
came
and
fetched
them
and
brought
them
again
into
the
guard
chamber
and
when
he
humbled
himself
the
wrath
of
the
lord
turned
from
him
that
he
would
not
destroy
him
altogether
and
also
in
judah
things
went
well
so
king
rehoboam
strengthened
himself
in
jerusalem
and
reigned
for
rehoboam
was
one
and
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
the
lord
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
put
his
name
there
and
his
mother's
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
and
he
did
evil
because
he
prepared
not
his
heart
to
seek
the
lord
now
the
acts
of
rehoboam
first
and
last
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
shemaiah
the
prophet
and
of
iddo
the
seer
concerning
genealogies
and
there
were
wars
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
continually
and
rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
and
abijah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
jeroboam
began
abijah
to
reign
over
judah
he
reigned
three
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
michaiah
the
daughter
of
uriel
of
gibeah
and
there
was
war
between
abijah
and
jeroboam
and
abijah
set
the
battle
in
array
with
an
army
of
valiant
men
of
war
even
four
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
jeroboam
also
set
the
battle
in
array
against
him
with
eight
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
being
mighty
men
of
valour
and
abijah
stood
up
upon
mount
zemaraim
which
is
in
mount
ephraim
and
said
hear
me
thou
jeroboam
and
all
israel
ought
ye
not
to
know
that
the
lord
god
of
israel
gave
the
kingdom
over
israel
to
david
for
ever
even
to
him
and
to
his
sons
by
a
covenant
of
salt
yet
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
the
servant
of
solomon
the
son
of
david
is
risen
up
and
hath
rebelled
against
his
lord
and
there
are
gathered
unto
him
vain
men
the
children
of
belial
and
have
strengthened
themselves
against
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
when
rehoboam
was
young
and
tenderhearted
and
could
not
withstand
them
and
now
ye
think
to
withstand
the
kingdom
of
the
lord
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
david
and
ye
be
a
great
multitude
and
there
are
with
your
golden
calves
which
jeroboam
made
you
for
gods
have
ye
not
cast
out
the
priests
of
the
lord
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
and
have
made
you
priests
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
so
that
whosoever
cometh
to
consecrate
himself
with
a
young
bullock
and
seven
rams
the
same
may
be
a
priest
of
them
that
are
no
gods
but
as
for
us
the
lord
is
our
god
and
we
have
not
forsaken
him
and
the
priests
which
minister
unto
the
lord
are
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
wait
upon
their
business
and
they
burn
unto
the
lord
every
morning
and
every
evening
burnt
sacrifices
and
sweet
incense
the
shewbread
also
set
they
in
order
upon
the
pure
table
and
the
candlestick
of
gold
with
the
lamps
thereof
to
burn
every
evening
for
we
keep
the
charge
of
the
lord
our
god
but
ye
have
forsaken
him
and
behold
god
himself
is
with
us
for
our
captain
and
his
priests
with
sounding
trumpets
to
cry
alarm
against
you
o
children
of
israel
fight
ye
not
against
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
for
ye
shall
not
prosper
but
jeroboam
caused
an
ambushment
to
come
about
behind
them
so
they
were
before
judah
and
the
ambushment
was
behind
them
and
when
judah
looked
back
behold
the
battle
was
before
and
behind
and
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
the
priests
sounded
with
the
trumpets
then
the
men
of
judah
gave
a
shout
and
as
the
men
of
judah
shouted
it
came
to
pass
that
god
smote
jeroboam
and
all
israel
before
abijah
and
judah
and
the
children
of
israel
fled
before
judah
and
god
delivered
them
into
their
hand
and
abijah
and
his
people
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
so
there
fell
down
slain
of
israel
five
hundred
thousand
chosen
men
thus
the
children
of
israel
were
brought
under
at
that
time
and
the
children
of
judah
prevailed
because
they
relied
upon
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
abijah
pursued
after
jeroboam
and
took
cities
from
him
bethel
with
the
towns
thereof
and
jeshanah
with
the
towns
thereof
and
ephraim
with
the
towns
thereof
neither
did
jeroboam
recover
strength
again
in
the
days
of
abijah
and
the
lord
struck
him
and
he
died
but
abijah
waxed
mighty
and
married
fourteen
wives
and
begat
twenty
and
two
sons
and
sixteen
daughters
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
abijah
and
his
ways
and
his
sayings
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
prophet
iddo
so
abijah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
his
days
the
land
was
quiet
ten
years
and
asa
did
that
which
was
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
his
god
for
he
took
away
the
altars
of
the
strange
gods
and
the
high
places
and
brake
down
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
commanded
judah
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
to
do
the
law
and
the
commandment
also
he
took
away
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
the
high
places
and
the
images
and
the
kingdom
was
quiet
before
him
and
he
built
fenced
cities
in
judah
for
the
land
had
rest
and
he
had
no
war
in
those
years
because
the
lord
had
given
him
rest
therefore
he
said
unto
judah
let
us
build
these
cities
and
make
about
them
walls
and
towers
gates
and
bars
while
the
land
is
yet
before
us
because
we
have
sought
the
lord
our
god
we
have
sought
him
and
he
hath
given
us
rest
on
every
side
so
they
built
and
prospered
and
asa
had
an
army
of
men
that
bare
targets
and
spears
out
of
judah
three
hundred
thousand
and
out
of
benjamin
that
bare
shields
and
drew
bows
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
all
these
were
mighty
men
of
valour
and
there
came
out
against
them
zerah
the
ethiopian
with
an
host
of
a
thousand
thousand
and
three
hundred
chariots
and
came
unto
mareshah
then
asa
went
out
against
him
and
they
set
the
battle
in
array
in
the
valley
of
zephathah
at
mareshah
and
asa
cried
unto
the
lord
his
god
and
said
lord
it
is
nothing
with
thee
to
help
whether
with
many
or
with
them
that
have
no
power
help
us
o
lord
our
god
for
we
rest
on
thee
and
in
thy
name
we
go
against
this
multitude
o
lord
thou
art
our
god
let
no
man
prevail
against
thee
so
the
lord
smote
the
ethiopians
before
asa
and
before
judah
and
the
ethiopians
fled
and
asa
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
pursued
them
unto
gerar
and
the
ethiopians
were
overthrown
that
they
could
not
recover
themselves
for
they
were
destroyed
before
the
lord
and
before
his
host
and
they
carried
away
very
much
spoil
and
they
smote
all
the
cities
round
about
gerar
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
they
spoiled
all
the
cities
for
there
was
exceeding
much
spoil
in
them
they
smote
also
the
tents
of
cattle
and
carried
away
sheep
and
camels
in
abundance
and
returned
to
jerusalem
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
azariah
the
son
of
oded
and
he
went
out
to
meet
asa
and
said
unto
him
hear
ye
me
asa
and
all
judah
and
benjamin
the
lord
is
with
you
while
ye
be
with
him
and
if
ye
seek
him
he
will
be
found
of
you
but
if
ye
forsake
him
he
will
forsake
you
now
for
a
long
season
israel
hath
been
without
the
true
god
and
without
a
teaching
priest
and
without
law
but
when
they
in
their
trouble
did
turn
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
sought
him
he
was
found
of
them
and
in
those
times
there
was
no
peace
to
him
that
went
out
nor
to
him
that
came
in
but
great
vexations
were
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
countries
and
nation
was
destroyed
of
nation
and
city
of
city
for
god
did
vex
them
with
all
adversity
be
ye
strong
therefore
and
let
not
your
hands
be
weak
for
your
work
shall
be
rewarded
and
when
asa
heard
these
words
and
the
prophecy
of
oded
the
prophet
he
took
courage
and
put
away
the
abominable
idols
out
of
all
the
land
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
out
of
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
from
mount
ephraim
and
renewed
the
altar
of
the
lord
that
was
before
the
porch
of
the
lord
and
he
gathered
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
the
strangers
with
them
out
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
and
out
of
simeon
for
they
fell
to
him
out
of
israel
in
abundance
when
they
saw
that
the
lord
his
god
was
with
him
so
they
gathered
themselves
together
at
jerusalem
in
the
third
month
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
and
they
offered
unto
the
lord
the
same
time
of
the
spoil
which
they
had
brought
seven
hundred
oxen
and
seven
thousand
sheep
and
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
seek
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
that
whosoever
would
not
seek
the
lord
god
of
israel
should
be
put
to
death
whether
small
or
great
whether
man
or
woman
and
they
sware
unto
the
lord
with
a
loud
voice
and
with
shouting
and
with
trumpets
and
with
cornets
and
all
judah
rejoiced
at
the
oath
for
they
had
sworn
with
all
their
heart
and
sought
him
with
their
whole
desire
and
he
was
found
of
them
and
the
lord
gave
them
rest
round
about
and
also
concerning
maachah
the
mother
of
asa
the
king
he
removed
her
from
being
queen
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove
and
asa
cut
down
her
idol
and
stamped
it
and
burnt
it
at
the
brook
kidron
but
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
out
of
israel
nevertheless
the
heart
of
asa
was
perfect
all
his
days
and
he
brought
into
the
house
of
god
the
things
that
his
father
had
dedicated
and
that
he
himself
had
dedicated
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
and
there
was
no
more
war
unto
the
five
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
in
the
six
and
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
asa
baasha
king
of
israel
came
up
against
judah
and
built
ramah
to
the
intent
that
he
might
let
none
go
out
or
come
in
to
asa
king
of
judah
then
asa
brought
out
silver
and
gold
out
of
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
of
the
king's
house
and
sent
to
benhadad
king
of
syria
that
dwelt
at
damascus
saying
there
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee
as
there
was
between
my
father
and
thy
father
behold
i
have
sent
thee
silver
and
gold
go
break
thy
league
with
baasha
king
of
israel
that
he
may
depart
from
me
and
benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
asa
and
sent
the
captains
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
israel
and
they
smote
ijon
and
dan
and
abelmaim
and
all
the
store
cities
of
naphtali
and
it
came
to
pass
when
baasha
heard
it
that
he
left
off
building
of
ramah
and
let
his
work
cease
then
asa
the
king
took
all
judah
and
they
carried
away
the
stones
of
ramah
and
the
timber
thereof
wherewith
baasha
was
building
and
he
built
therewith
geba
and
mizpah
and
at
that
time
hanani
the
seer
came
to
asa
king
of
judah
and
said
unto
him
because
thou
hast
relied
on
the
king
of
syria
and
not
relied
on
the
lord
thy
god
therefore
is
the
host
of
the
king
of
syria
escaped
out
of
thine
hand
were
not
the
ethiopians
and
the
lubims
a
huge
host
with
very
many
chariots
and
horsemen
yet
because
thou
didst
rely
on
the
lord
he
delivered
them
into
thine
hand
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
run
to
and
fro
throughout
the
whole
earth
to
shew
himself
strong
in
the
behalf
of
them
whose
heart
is
perfect
toward
him
herein
thou
hast
done
foolishly
therefore
from
henceforth
thou
shalt
have
wars
then
asa
was
wroth
with
the
seer
and
put
him
in
a
prison
house
for
he
was
in
a
rage
with
him
because
of
this
thing
and
asa
oppressed
some
of
the
people
the
same
time
and
behold
the
acts
of
asa
first
and
last
lo
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
and
asa
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
his
reign
was
diseased
in
his
feet
until
his
disease
was
exceeding
great
yet
in
his
disease
he
sought
not
to
the
lord
but
to
the
physicians
and
asa
slept
with
his
fathers
and
died
in
the
one
and
fortieth
year
of
his
reign
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own
sepulchres
which
he
had
made
for
himself
in
the
city
of
david
and
laid
him
in
the
bed
which
was
filled
with
sweet
odours
and
divers
kinds
of
spices
prepared
by
the
apothecaries
art
and
they
made
a
very
great
burning
for
him
and
jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
strengthened
himself
against
israel
and
he
placed
forces
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
and
set
garrisons
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
the
cities
of
ephraim
which
asa
his
father
had
taken
and
the
lord
was
with
jehoshaphat
because
he
walked
in
the
first
ways
of
his
father
david
and
sought
not
unto
baalim
but
sought
to
the
lord
god
of
his
father
and
walked
in
his
commandments
and
not
after
the
doings
of
israel
therefore
the
lord
stablished
the
kingdom
in
his
hand
and
all
judah
brought
to
jehoshaphat
presents
and
he
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance
and
his
heart
was
lifted
up
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
moreover
he
took
away
the
high
places
and
groves
out
of
judah
also
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
sent
to
his
princes
even
to
benhail
and
to
obadiah
and
to
zechariah
and
to
nethaneel
and
to
michaiah
to
teach
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
with
them
he
sent
levites
even
shemaiah
and
nethaniah
and
zebadiah
and
asahel
and
shemiramoth
and
jehonathan
and
adonijah
and
tobijah
and
tobadonijah
levites
and
with
them
elishama
and
jehoram
priests
and
they
taught
in
judah
and
had
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
with
them
and
went
about
throughout
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
taught
the
people
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
fell
upon
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
lands
that
were
round
about
judah
so
that
they
made
no
war
against
jehoshaphat
also
some
of
the
philistines
brought
jehoshaphat
presents
and
tribute
silver
and
the
arabians
brought
him
flocks
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
rams
and
seven
thousand
and
seven
hundred
he
goats
and
jehoshaphat
waxed
great
exceedingly
and
he
built
in
judah
castles
and
cities
of
store
and
he
had
much
business
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
men
of
war
mighty
men
of
valour
were
in
jerusalem
and
these
are
the
numbers
of
them
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
of
judah
the
captains
of
thousands
adnah
the
chief
and
with
him
mighty
men
of
valour
three
hundred
thousand
and
next
to
him
was
jehohanan
the
captain
and
with
him
two
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
and
next
him
was
amasiah
the
son
of
zichri
who
willingly
offered
himself
unto
the
lord
and
with
him
two
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
and
of
benjamin
eliada
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
with
him
armed
men
with
bow
and
shield
two
hundred
thousand
and
next
him
was
jehozabad
and
with
him
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
ready
prepared
for
the
war
these
waited
on
the
king
beside
those
whom
the
king
put
in
the
fenced
cities
throughout
all
judah
now
jehoshaphat
had
riches
and
honour
in
abundance
and
joined
affinity
with
ahab
and
after
certain
years
he
went
down
to
ahab
to
samaria
and
ahab
killed
sheep
and
oxen
for
him
in
abundance
and
for
the
people
that
he
had
with
him
and
persuaded
him
to
go
up
with
him
to
ramothgilead
and
ahab
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
ramothgilead
and
he
answered
him
i
am
as
thou
art
and
my
people
as
thy
people
and
we
will
be
with
thee
in
the
war
and
jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
enquire
i
pray
thee
at
the
word
of
the
lord
to
day
therefore
the
king
of
israel
gathered
together
of
prophets
four
hundred
men
and
said
unto
them
shall
we
go
to
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
they
said
go
up
for
god
will
deliver
it
into
the
king's
hand
but
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
besides
that
we
might
enquire
of
him
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
there
is
yet
one
man
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
but
i
hate
him
for
he
never
prophesied
good
unto
me
but
always
evil
the
same
is
micaiah
the
son
of
imla
and
jehoshaphat
said
let
not
the
king
say
so
and
the
king
of
israel
called
for
one
of
his
officers
and
said
fetch
quickly
micaiah
the
son
of
imla
and
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
sat
either
of
them
on
his
throne
clothed
in
their
robes
and
they
sat
in
a
void
place
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
samaria
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
had
made
him
horns
of
iron
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
with
these
thou
shalt
push
syria
until
they
be
consumed
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so
saying
go
up
to
ramothgilead
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
and
the
messenger
that
went
to
call
micaiah
spake
to
him
saying
behold
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
to
the
king
with
one
assent
let
thy
word
therefore
i
pray
thee
be
like
one
of
their's
and
speak
thou
good
and
micaiah
said
as
the
lord
liveth
even
what
my
god
saith
that
will
i
speak
and
when
he
was
come
to
the
king
the
king
said
unto
him
micaiah
shall
we
go
to
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
he
said
go
ye
up
and
prosper
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand
and
the
king
said
to
him
how
many
times
shall
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
say
nothing
but
the
truth
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
lord
then
he
said
i
did
see
all
israel
scattered
upon
the
mountains
as
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
and
the
lord
said
these
have
no
master
let
them
return
therefore
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace
and
the
king
of
israel
said
to
jehoshaphat
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
not
prophesy
good
unto
me
but
evil
again
he
said
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
i
saw
the
lord
sitting
upon
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
entice
ahab
king
of
israel
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
ramothgilead
and
one
spake
saying
after
this
manner
and
another
saying
after
that
manner
then
there
came
out
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
entice
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
and
he
said
i
will
go
out
and
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
the
lord
said
thou
shalt
entice
him
and
thou
shalt
also
prevail
go
out
and
do
even
so
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
against
thee
then
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
came
near
and
smote
micaiah
upon
the
cheek
and
said
which
way
went
the
spirit
of
the
lord
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee
and
micaiah
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
on
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself
then
the
king
of
israel
said
take
ye
micaiah
and
carry
him
back
to
amon
the
governor
of
the
city
and
to
joash
the
king's
son
and
say
thus
saith
the
king
put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction
until
i
return
in
peace
and
micaiah
said
if
thou
certainly
return
in
peace
then
hath
not
the
lord
spoken
by
me
and
he
said
hearken
all
ye
people
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
went
up
to
ramothgilead
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
i
will
disguise
myself
and
i
will
go
to
the
battle
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes
so
the
king
of
israel
disguised
himself
and
they
went
to
the
battle
now
the
king
of
syria
had
commanded
the
captains
of
the
chariots
that
were
with
him
saying
fight
ye
not
with
small
or
great
save
only
with
the
king
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
jehoshaphat
that
they
said
it
is
the
king
of
israel
therefore
they
compassed
about
him
to
fight
but
jehoshaphat
cried
out
and
the
lord
helped
him
and
god
moved
them
to
depart
from
him
for
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
israel
they
turned
back
again
from
pursuing
him
and
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture
and
smote
the
king
of
israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness
therefore
he
said
to
his
chariot
man
turn
thine
hand
that
thou
mayest
carry
me
out
of
the
host
for
i
am
wounded
and
the
battle
increased
that
day
howbeit
the
king
of
israel
stayed
himself
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
syrians
until
the
even
and
about
the
time
of
the
sun
going
down
he
died
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
returned
to
his
house
in
peace
to
jerusalem
and
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
the
seer
went
out
to
meet
him
and
said
to
king
jehoshaphat
shouldest
thou
help
the
ungodly
and
love
them
that
hate
the
lord
therefore
is
wrath
upon
thee
from
before
the
lord
nevertheless
there
are
good
things
found
in
thee
in
that
thou
hast
taken
away
the
groves
out
of
the
land
and
hast
prepared
thine
heart
to
seek
god
and
jehoshaphat
dwelt
at
jerusalem
and
he
went
out
again
through
the
people
from
beersheba
to
mount
ephraim
and
brought
them
back
unto
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
he
set
judges
in
the
land
throughout
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
city
by
city
and
said
to
the
judges
take
heed
what
ye
do
for
ye
judge
not
for
man
but
for
the
lord
who
is
with
you
in
the
judgment
wherefore
now
let
the
fear
of
the
lord
be
upon
you
take
heed
and
do
it
for
there
is
no
iniquity
with
the
lord
our
god
nor
respect
of
persons
nor
taking
of
gifts
moreover
in
jerusalem
did
jehoshaphat
set
of
the
levites
and
of
the
priests
and
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
for
the
judgment
of
the
lord
and
for
controversies
when
they
returned
to
jerusalem
and
he
charged
them
saying
thus
shall
ye
do
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
faithfully
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
what
cause
soever
shall
come
to
you
of
your
brethren
that
dwell
in
your
cities
between
blood
and
blood
between
law
and
commandment
statutes
and
judgments
ye
shall
even
warn
them
that
they
trespass
not
against
the
lord
and
so
wrath
come
upon
you
and
upon
your
brethren
this
do
and
ye
shall
not
trespass
and
behold
amariah
the
chief
priest
is
over
you
in
all
matters
of
the
lord
and
zebadiah
the
son
of
ishmael
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
judah
for
all
the
king's
matters
also
the
levites
shall
be
officers
before
you
deal
courageously
and
the
lord
shall
be
with
the
good
it
came
to
pass
after
this
also
that
the
children
of
moab
and
the
children
of
ammon
and
with
them
other
beside
the
ammonites
came
against
jehoshaphat
to
battle
then
there
came
some
that
told
jehoshaphat
saying
there
cometh
a
great
multitude
against
thee
from
beyond
the
sea
on
this
side
syria
and
behold
they
be
in
hazazontamar
which
is
engedi
and
jehoshaphat
feared
and
set
himself
to
seek
the
lord
and
proclaimed
a
fast
throughout
all
judah
and
judah
gathered
themselves
together
to
ask
help
of
the
lord
even
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
they
came
to
seek
the
lord
and
jehoshaphat
stood
in
the
congregation
of
judah
and
jerusalem
in
the
house
of
the
lord
before
the
new
court
and
said
o
lord
god
of
our
fathers
art
not
thou
god
in
heaven
and
rulest
not
thou
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
heathen
and
in
thine
hand
is
there
not
power
and
might
so
that
none
is
able
to
withstand
thee
art
not
thou
our
god
who
didst
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
before
thy
people
israel
and
gavest
it
to
the
seed
of
abraham
thy
friend
for
ever
and
they
dwelt
therein
and
have
built
thee
a
sanctuary
therein
for
thy
name
saying
if
when
evil
cometh
upon
us
as
the
sword
judgment
or
pestilence
or
famine
we
stand
before
this
house
and
in
thy
presence
for
thy
name
is
in
this
house
and
cry
unto
thee
in
our
affliction
then
thou
wilt
hear
and
help
and
now
behold
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
and
mount
seir
whom
thou
wouldest
not
let
israel
invade
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
they
turned
from
them
and
destroyed
them
not
behold
i
say
how
they
reward
us
to
come
to
cast
us
out
of
thy
possession
which
thou
hast
given
us
to
inherit
o
our
god
wilt
thou
not
judge
them
for
we
have
no
might
against
this
great
company
that
cometh
against
us
neither
know
we
what
to
do
but
our
eyes
are
upon
thee
and
all
judah
stood
before
the
lord
with
their
little
ones
their
wives
and
their
children
then
upon
jahaziel
the
son
of
zechariah
the
son
of
benaiah
the
son
of
jeiel
the
son
of
mattaniah
a
levite
of
the
sons
of
asaph
came
the
spirit
of
the
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
he
said
hearken
ye
all
judah
and
ye
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
thou
king
jehoshaphat
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
you
be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
by
reason
of
this
great
multitude
for
the
battle
is
not
yours
but
god's
to
morrow
go
ye
down
against
them
behold
they
come
up
by
the
cliff
of
ziz
and
ye
shall
find
them
at
the
end
of
the
brook
before
the
wilderness
of
jeruel
ye
shall
not
need
to
fight
in
this
battle
set
yourselves
stand
ye
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
with
you
o
judah
and
jerusalem
fear
not
nor
be
dismayed
to
morrow
go
out
against
them
for
the
lord
will
be
with
you
and
jehoshaphat
bowed
his
head
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
all
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
fell
before
the
lord
worshipping
the
lord
and
the
levites
of
the
children
of
the
kohathites
and
of
the
children
of
the
korhites
stood
up
to
praise
the
lord
god
of
israel
with
a
loud
voice
on
high
and
they
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
tekoa
and
as
they
went
forth
jehoshaphat
stood
and
said
hear
me
o
judah
and
ye
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
believe
in
the
lord
your
god
so
shall
ye
be
established
believe
his
prophets
so
shall
ye
prosper
and
when
he
had
consulted
with
the
people
he
appointed
singers
unto
the
lord
and
that
should
praise
the
beauty
of
holiness
as
they
went
out
before
the
army
and
to
say
praise
the
lord
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
and
when
they
began
to
sing
and
to
praise
the
lord
set
ambushments
against
the
children
of
ammon
moab
and
mount
seir
which
were
come
against
judah
and
they
were
smitten
for
the
children
of
ammon
and
moab
stood
up
against
the
inhabitants
of
mount
seir
utterly
to
slay
and
destroy
them
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
the
inhabitants
of
seir
every
one
helped
to
destroy
another
and
when
judah
came
toward
the
watch
tower
in
the
wilderness
they
looked
unto
the
multitude
and
behold
they
were
dead
bodies
fallen
to
the
earth
and
none
escaped
and
when
jehoshaphat
and
his
people
came
to
take
away
the
spoil
of
them
they
found
among
them
in
abundance
both
riches
with
the
dead
bodies
and
precious
jewels
which
they
stripped
off
for
themselves
more
than
they
could
carry
away
and
they
were
three
days
in
gathering
of
the
spoil
it
was
so
much
and
on
the
fourth
day
they
assembled
themselves
in
the
valley
of
berachah
for
there
they
blessed
the
lord
therefore
the
name
of
the
same
place
was
called
the
valley
of
berachah
unto
this
day
then
they
returned
every
man
of
judah
and
jerusalem
and
jehoshaphat
in
the
forefront
of
them
to
go
again
to
jerusalem
with
joy
for
the
lord
had
made
them
to
rejoice
over
their
enemies
and
they
came
to
jerusalem
with
psalteries
and
harps
and
trumpets
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
fear
of
god
was
on
all
the
kingdoms
of
those
countries
when
they
had
heard
that
the
lord
fought
against
the
enemies
of
israel
so
the
realm
of
jehoshaphat
was
quiet
for
his
god
gave
him
rest
round
about
and
jehoshaphat
reigned
over
judah
he
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
azubah
the
daughter
of
shilhi
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
asa
his
father
and
departed
not
from
it
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
for
as
yet
the
people
had
not
prepared
their
hearts
unto
the
god
of
their
fathers
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoshaphat
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
who
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
after
this
did
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
join
himself
with
ahaziah
king
of
israel
who
did
very
wickedly
and
he
joined
himself
with
him
to
make
ships
to
go
to
tarshish
and
they
made
the
ships
in
eziongaber
then
eliezer
the
son
of
dodavah
of
mareshah
prophesied
against
jehoshaphat
saying
because
thou
hast
joined
thyself
with
ahaziah
the
lord
hath
broken
thy
works
and
the
ships
were
broken
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
to
tarshish
now
jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
he
had
brethren
the
sons
of
jehoshaphat
azariah
and
jehiel
and
zechariah
and
azariah
and
michael
and
shephatiah
all
these
were
the
sons
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
israel
and
their
father
gave
them
great
gifts
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
of
precious
things
with
fenced
cities
in
judah
but
the
kingdom
gave
he
to
jehoram
because
he
was
the
firstborn
now
when
jehoram
was
risen
up
to
the
kingdom
of
his
father
he
strengthened
himself
and
slew
all
his
brethren
with
the
sword
and
divers
also
of
the
princes
of
israel
jehoram
was
thirty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
jerusalem
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
like
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
he
had
the
daughter
of
ahab
to
wife
and
he
wrought
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
howbeit
the
lord
would
not
destroy
the
house
of
david
because
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
david
and
as
he
promised
to
give
a
light
to
him
and
to
his
sons
for
ever
in
his
days
the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
dominion
of
judah
and
made
themselves
a
king
then
jehoram
went
forth
with
his
princes
and
all
his
chariots
with
him
and
he
rose
up
by
night
and
smote
the
edomites
which
compassed
him
in
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots
so
the
edomites
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
unto
this
day
the
same
time
also
did
libnah
revolt
from
under
his
hand
because
he
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
moreover
he
made
high
places
in
the
mountains
of
judah
and
caused
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
commit
fornication
and
compelled
judah
thereto
and
there
came
a
writing
to
him
from
elijah
the
prophet
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
david
thy
father
because
thou
hast
not
walked
in
the
ways
of
jehoshaphat
thy
father
nor
in
the
ways
of
asa
king
of
judah
but
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
hast
made
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
go
a
whoring
like
to
the
whoredoms
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
also
hast
slain
thy
brethren
of
thy
father's
house
which
were
better
than
thyself
behold
with
a
great
plague
will
the
lord
smite
thy
people
and
thy
children
and
thy
wives
and
all
thy
goods
and
thou
shalt
have
great
sickness
by
disease
of
thy
bowels
until
thy
bowels
fall
out
by
reason
of
the
sickness
day
by
day
moreover
the
lord
stirred
up
against
jehoram
the
spirit
of
the
philistines
and
of
the
arabians
that
were
near
the
ethiopians
and
they
came
up
into
judah
and
brake
into
it
and
carried
away
all
the
substance
that
was
found
in
the
king's
house
and
his
sons
also
and
his
wives
so
that
there
was
never
a
son
left
him
save
jehoahaz
the
youngest
of
his
sons
and
after
all
this
the
lord
smote
him
in
his
bowels
with
an
incurable
disease
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
process
of
time
after
the
end
of
two
years
his
bowels
fell
out
by
reason
of
his
sickness
so
he
died
of
sore
diseases
and
his
people
made
no
burning
for
him
like
the
burning
of
his
fathers
thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
in
jerusalem
eight
years
and
departed
without
being
desired
howbeit
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
but
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
made
ahaziah
his
youngest
son
king
in
his
stead
for
the
band
of
men
that
came
with
the
arabians
to
the
camp
had
slain
all
the
eldest
so
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
reigned
forty
and
two
years
old
was
ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
athaliah
the
daughter
of
omri
he
also
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
house
of
ahab
for
his
mother
was
his
counsellor
to
do
wickedly
wherefore
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
the
house
of
ahab
for
they
were
his
counsellors
after
the
death
of
his
father
to
his
destruction
he
walked
also
after
their
counsel
and
went
with
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
to
war
against
hazael
king
of
syria
at
ramothgilead
and
the
syrians
smote
joram
and
he
returned
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
because
of
the
wounds
which
were
given
him
at
ramah
when
he
fought
with
hazael
king
of
syria
and
azariah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
went
down
to
see
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
at
jezreel
because
he
was
sick
and
the
destruction
of
ahaziah
was
of
god
by
coming
to
joram
for
when
he
was
come
he
went
out
with
jehoram
against
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
whom
the
lord
had
anointed
to
cut
off
the
house
of
ahab
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jehu
was
executing
judgment
upon
the
house
of
ahab
and
found
the
princes
of
judah
and
the
sons
of
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
that
ministered
to
ahaziah
he
slew
them
and
he
sought
ahaziah
and
they
caught
him
for
he
was
hid
in
samaria
and
brought
him
to
jehu
and
when
they
had
slain
him
they
buried
him
because
said
they
he
is
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
who
sought
the
lord
with
all
his
heart
so
the
house
of
ahaziah
had
no
power
to
keep
still
the
kingdom
but
when
athaliah
the
mother
of
ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
of
the
house
of
judah
but
jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
the
king
took
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king's
sons
that
were
slain
and
put
him
and
his
nurse
in
a
bedchamber
so
jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
king
jehoram
the
wife
of
jehoiada
the
priest
for
she
was
the
sister
of
ahaziah
hid
him
from
athaliah
so
that
she
slew
him
not
and
he
was
with
them
hid
in
the
house
of
god
six
years
and
athaliah
reigned
over
the
land
and
in
the
seventh
year
jehoiada
strengthened
himself
and
took
the
captains
of
hundreds
azariah
the
son
of
jeroham
and
ishmael
the
son
of
jehohanan
and
azariah
the
son
of
obed
and
maaseiah
the
son
of
adaiah
and
elishaphat
the
son
of
zichri
into
covenant
with
him
and
they
went
about
in
judah
and
gathered
the
levites
out
of
all
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
and
they
came
to
jerusalem
and
all
the
congregation
made
a
covenant
with
the
king
in
the
house
of
god
and
he
said
unto
them
behold
the
king's
son
shall
reign
as
the
lord
hath
said
of
the
sons
of
david
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
a
third
part
of
you
entering
on
the
sabbath
of
the
priests
and
of
the
levites
shall
be
porters
of
the
doors
and
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
king's
house
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
of
the
foundation
and
all
the
people
shall
be
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
but
let
none
come
into
the
house
of
the
lord
save
the
priests
and
they
that
minister
of
the
levites
they
shall
go
in
for
they
are
holy
but
all
the
people
shall
keep
the
watch
of
the
lord
and
the
levites
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
whosoever
else
cometh
into
the
house
he
shall
be
put
to
death
but
be
ye
with
the
king
when
he
cometh
in
and
when
he
goeth
out
so
the
levites
and
all
judah
did
according
to
all
things
that
jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded
and
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath
with
them
that
were
to
go
out
on
the
sabbath
for
jehoiada
the
priest
dismissed
not
the
courses
moreover
jehoiada
the
priest
delivered
to
the
captains
of
hundreds
spears
and
bucklers
and
shields
that
had
been
king
david's
which
were
in
the
house
of
god
and
he
set
all
the
people
every
man
having
his
weapon
in
his
hand
from
the
right
side
of
the
temple
to
the
left
side
of
the
temple
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple
by
the
king
round
about
then
they
brought
out
the
king's
son
and
put
upon
him
the
crown
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
made
him
king
and
jehoiada
and
his
sons
anointed
him
and
said
god
save
the
king
now
when
athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
running
and
praising
the
king
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
she
looked
and
behold
the
king
stood
at
his
pillar
at
the
entering
in
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpets
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
sounded
with
trumpets
also
the
singers
with
instruments
of
musick
and
such
as
taught
to
sing
praise
then
athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
said
treason
treason
then
jehoiada
the
priest
brought
out
the
captains
of
hundreds
that
were
set
over
the
host
and
said
unto
them
have
her
forth
of
the
ranges
and
whoso
followeth
her
let
him
be
slain
with
the
sword
for
the
priest
said
slay
her
not
in
the
house
of
the
lord
so
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
when
she
was
come
to
the
entering
of
the
horse
gate
by
the
king's
house
they
slew
her
there
and
jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
him
and
between
all
the
people
and
between
the
king
that
they
should
be
the
lord's
people
then
all
the
people
went
to
the
house
of
baal
and
brake
it
down
and
brake
his
altars
and
his
images
in
pieces
and
slew
mattan
the
priest
of
baal
before
the
altars
also
jehoiada
appointed
the
offices
of
the
house
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
the
priests
the
levites
whom
david
had
distributed
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
offer
the
burnt
offerings
of
the
lord
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
with
rejoicing
and
with
singing
as
it
was
ordained
by
david
and
he
set
the
porters
at
the
gates
of
the
house
of
the
lord
that
none
which
was
unclean
in
any
thing
should
enter
in
and
he
took
the
captains
of
hundreds
and
the
nobles
and
the
governors
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
came
through
the
high
gate
into
the
king's
house
and
set
the
king
upon
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
after
that
they
had
slain
athaliah
with
the
sword
joash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
forty
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
zibiah
of
beersheba
and
joash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
the
days
of
jehoiada
the
priest
and
jehoiada
took
for
him
two
wives
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
joash
was
minded
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
gathered
together
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
said
to
them
go
out
unto
the
cities
of
judah
and
gather
of
all
israel
money
to
repair
the
house
of
your
god
from
year
to
year
and
see
that
ye
hasten
the
matter
howbeit
the
levites
hastened
it
not
and
the
king
called
for
jehoiada
the
chief
and
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
not
required
of
the
levites
to
bring
in
out
of
judah
and
out
of
jerusalem
the
collection
according
to
the
commandment
of
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
and
of
the
congregation
of
israel
for
the
tabernacle
of
witness
for
the
sons
of
athaliah
that
wicked
woman
had
broken
up
the
house
of
god
and
also
all
the
dedicated
things
of
the
house
of
the
lord
did
they
bestow
upon
baalim
and
at
the
king's
commandment
they
made
a
chest
and
set
it
without
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
made
a
proclamation
through
judah
and
jerusalem
to
bring
in
to
the
lord
the
collection
that
moses
the
servant
of
god
laid
upon
israel
in
the
wilderness
and
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
and
brought
in
and
cast
into
the
chest
until
they
had
made
an
end
now
it
came
to
pass
that
at
what
time
the
chest
was
brought
unto
the
king's
office
by
the
hand
of
the
levites
and
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
the
king's
scribe
and
the
high
priest's
officer
came
and
emptied
the
chest
and
took
it
and
carried
it
to
his
place
again
thus
they
did
day
by
day
and
gathered
money
in
abundance
and
the
king
and
jehoiada
gave
it
to
such
as
did
the
work
of
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hired
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
and
also
such
as
wrought
iron
and
brass
to
mend
the
house
of
the
lord
so
the
workmen
wrought
and
the
work
was
perfected
by
them
and
they
set
the
house
of
god
in
his
state
and
strengthened
it
and
when
they
had
finished
it
they
brought
the
rest
of
the
money
before
the
king
and
jehoiada
whereof
were
made
vessels
for
the
house
of
the
lord
even
vessels
to
minister
and
to
offer
withal
and
spoons
and
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
they
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
house
of
the
lord
continually
all
the
days
of
jehoiada
but
jehoiada
waxed
old
and
was
full
of
days
when
he
died
an
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
was
he
when
he
died
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
among
the
kings
because
he
had
done
good
in
israel
both
toward
god
and
toward
his
house
now
after
the
death
of
jehoiada
came
the
princes
of
judah
and
made
obeisance
to
the
king
then
the
king
hearkened
unto
them
and
they
left
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
served
groves
and
idols
and
wrath
came
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
for
this
their
trespass
yet
he
sent
prophets
to
them
to
bring
them
again
unto
the
lord
and
they
testified
against
them
but
they
would
not
give
ear
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
zechariah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
priest
which
stood
above
the
people
and
said
unto
them
thus
saith
god
why
transgress
ye
the
commandments
of
the
lord
that
ye
cannot
prosper
because
ye
have
forsaken
the
lord
he
hath
also
forsaken
you
and
they
conspired
against
him
and
stoned
him
with
stones
at
the
commandment
of
the
king
in
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
lord
thus
joash
the
king
remembered
not
the
kindness
which
jehoiada
his
father
had
done
to
him
but
slew
his
son
and
when
he
died
he
said
the
lord
look
upon
it
and
require
it
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
the
host
of
syria
came
up
against
him
and
they
came
to
judah
and
jerusalem
and
destroyed
all
the
princes
of
the
people
from
among
the
people
and
sent
all
the
spoil
of
them
unto
the
king
of
damascus
for
the
army
of
the
syrians
came
with
a
small
company
of
men
and
the
lord
delivered
a
very
great
host
into
their
hand
because
they
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
so
they
executed
judgment
against
joash
and
when
they
were
departed
from
him
for
they
left
him
in
great
diseases
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
for
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
jehoiada
the
priest
and
slew
him
on
his
bed
and
he
died
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
but
they
buried
him
not
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
and
these
are
they
that
conspired
against
him
zabad
the
son
of
shimeath
an
ammonitess
and
jehozabad
the
son
of
shimrith
a
moabitess
now
concerning
his
sons
and
the
greatness
of
the
burdens
laid
upon
him
and
the
repairing
of
the
house
of
god
behold
they
are
written
in
the
story
of
the
book
of
the
kings
and
amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
amaziah
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
jehoaddan
of
jerusalem
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
not
with
a
perfect
heart
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
kingdom
was
established
to
him
that
he
slew
his
servants
that
had
killed
the
king
his
father
but
he
slew
not
their
children
but
did
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
in
the
book
of
moses
where
the
lord
commanded
saying
the
fathers
shall
not
die
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
die
for
the
fathers
but
every
man
shall
die
for
his
own
sin
moreover
amaziah
gathered
judah
together
and
made
them
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
hundreds
according
to
the
houses
of
their
fathers
throughout
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
he
numbered
them
from
twenty
years
old
and
above
and
found
them
three
hundred
thousand
choice
men
able
to
go
forth
to
war
that
could
handle
spear
and
shield
he
hired
also
an
hundred
thousand
mighty
men
of
valour
out
of
israel
for
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
but
there
came
a
man
of
god
to
him
saying
o
king
let
not
the
army
of
israel
go
with
thee
for
the
lord
is
not
with
israel
to
wit
with
all
the
children
of
ephraim
but
if
thou
wilt
go
do
it
be
strong
for
the
battle
god
shall
make
thee
fall
before
the
enemy
for
god
hath
power
to
help
and
to
cast
down
and
amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
god
but
what
shall
we
do
for
the
hundred
talents
which
i
have
given
to
the
army
of
israel
and
the
man
of
god
answered
the
lord
is
able
to
give
thee
much
more
than
this
then
amaziah
separated
them
to
wit
the
army
that
was
come
to
him
out
of
ephraim
to
go
home
again
wherefore
their
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
judah
and
they
returned
home
in
great
anger
and
amaziah
strengthened
himself
and
led
forth
his
people
and
went
to
the
valley
of
salt
and
smote
of
the
children
of
seir
ten
thousand
and
other
ten
thousand
left
alive
did
the
children
of
judah
carry
away
captive
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
rock
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
rock
that
they
all
were
broken
in
pieces
but
the
soldiers
of
the
army
which
amaziah
sent
back
that
they
should
not
go
with
him
to
battle
fell
upon
the
cities
of
judah
from
samaria
even
unto
bethhoron
and
smote
three
thousand
of
them
and
took
much
spoil
now
it
came
to
pass
after
that
amaziah
was
come
from
the
slaughter
of
the
edomites
that
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
children
of
seir
and
set
them
up
to
be
his
gods
and
bowed
down
himself
before
them
and
burned
incense
unto
them
wherefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
amaziah
and
he
sent
unto
him
a
prophet
which
said
unto
him
why
hast
thou
sought
after
the
gods
of
the
people
which
could
not
deliver
their
own
people
out
of
thine
hand
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
talked
with
him
that
the
king
said
unto
him
art
thou
made
of
the
king's
counsel
forbear
why
shouldest
thou
be
smitten
then
the
prophet
forbare
and
said
i
know
that
god
hath
determined
to
destroy
thee
because
thou
hast
done
this
and
hast
not
hearkened
unto
my
counsel
then
amaziah
king
of
judah
took
advice
and
sent
to
joash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
the
son
of
jehu
king
of
israel
saying
come
let
us
see
one
another
in
the
face
and
joash
king
of
israel
sent
to
amaziah
king
of
judah
saying
the
thistle
that
was
in
lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
lebanon
saying
give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
lebanon
and
trode
down
the
thistle
thou
sayest
lo
thou
hast
smitten
the
edomites
and
thine
heart
lifteth
thee
up
to
boast
abide
now
at
home
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thine
hurt
that
thou
shouldest
fall
even
thou
and
judah
with
thee
but
amaziah
would
not
hear
for
it
came
of
god
that
he
might
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
because
they
sought
after
the
gods
of
edom
so
joash
the
king
of
israel
went
up
and
they
saw
one
another
in
the
face
both
he
and
amaziah
king
of
judah
at
bethshemesh
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
and
they
fled
every
man
to
his
tent
and
joash
the
king
of
israel
took
amaziah
king
of
judah
the
son
of
joash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
at
bethshemesh
and
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
jerusalem
from
the
gate
of
ephraim
to
the
corner
gate
four
hundred
cubits
and
he
took
all
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
all
the
vessels
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
god
with
obededom
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
the
hostages
also
and
returned
to
samaria
and
amaziah
the
son
of
joash
king
of
judah
lived
after
the
death
of
joash
son
of
jehoahaz
king
of
israel
fifteen
years
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
amaziah
first
and
last
behold
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
now
after
the
time
that
amaziah
did
turn
away
from
following
the
lord
they
made
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
jerusalem
and
he
fled
to
lachish
but
they
sent
to
lachish
after
him
and
slew
him
there
and
they
brought
him
upon
horses
and
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
judah
then
all
the
people
of
judah
took
uzziah
who
was
sixteen
years
old
and
made
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
amaziah
he
built
eloth
and
restored
it
to
judah
after
that
the
king
slept
with
his
fathers
sixteen
years
old
was
uzziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
two
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
jecoliah
of
jerusalem
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
father
amaziah
did
and
he
sought
god
in
the
days
of
zechariah
who
had
understanding
in
the
visions
of
god
and
as
long
as
he
sought
the
lord
god
made
him
to
prosper
and
he
went
forth
and
warred
against
the
philistines
and
brake
down
the
wall
of
gath
and
the
wall
of
jabneh
and
the
wall
of
ashdod
and
built
cities
about
ashdod
and
among
the
philistines
and
god
helped
him
against
the
philistines
and
against
the
arabians
that
dwelt
in
gurbaal
and
the
mehunims
and
the
ammonites
gave
gifts
to
uzziah
and
his
name
spread
abroad
even
to
the
entering
in
of
egypt
for
he
strengthened
himself
exceedingly
moreover
uzziah
built
towers
in
jerusalem
at
the
corner
gate
and
at
the
valley
gate
and
at
the
turning
of
the
wall
and
fortified
them
also
he
built
towers
in
the
desert
and
digged
many
wells
for
he
had
much
cattle
both
in
the
low
country
and
in
the
plains
husbandmen
also
and
vine
dressers
in
the
mountains
and
in
carmel
for
he
loved
husbandry
moreover
uzziah
had
an
host
of
fighting
men
that
went
out
to
war
by
bands
according
to
the
number
of
their
account
by
the
hand
of
jeiel
the
scribe
and
maaseiah
the
ruler
under
the
hand
of
hananiah
one
of
the
king's
captains
the
whole
number
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
mighty
men
of
valour
were
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
and
under
their
hand
was
an
army
three
hundred
thousand
and
seven
thousand
and
five
hundred
that
made
war
with
mighty
power
to
help
the
king
against
the
enemy
and
uzziah
prepared
for
them
throughout
all
the
host
shields
and
spears
and
helmets
and
habergeons
and
bows
and
slings
to
cast
stones
and
he
made
in
jerusalem
engines
invented
by
cunning
men
to
be
on
the
towers
and
upon
the
bulwarks
to
shoot
arrows
and
great
stones
withal
and
his
name
spread
far
abroad
for
he
was
marvellously
helped
till
he
was
strong
but
when
he
was
strong
his
heart
was
lifted
up
to
his
destruction
for
he
transgressed
against
the
lord
his
god
and
went
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
to
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
of
incense
and
azariah
the
priest
went
in
after
him
and
with
him
fourscore
priests
of
the
lord
that
were
valiant
men
and
they
withstood
uzziah
the
king
and
said
unto
him
it
appertaineth
not
unto
thee
uzziah
to
burn
incense
unto
the
lord
but
to
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
that
are
consecrated
to
burn
incense
go
out
of
the
sanctuary
for
thou
hast
trespassed
neither
shall
it
be
for
thine
honour
from
the
lord
god
then
uzziah
was
wroth
and
had
a
censer
in
his
hand
to
burn
incense
and
while
he
was
wroth
with
the
priests
the
leprosy
even
rose
up
in
his
forehead
before
the
priests
in
the
house
of
the
lord
from
beside
the
incense
altar
and
azariah
the
chief
priest
and
all
the
priests
looked
upon
him
and
behold
he
was
leprous
in
his
forehead
and
they
thrust
him
out
from
thence
yea
himself
hasted
also
to
go
out
because
the
lord
had
smitten
him
and
uzziah
the
king
was
a
leper
unto
the
day
of
his
death
and
dwelt
in
a
several
house
being
a
leper
for
he
was
cut
off
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
jotham
his
son
was
over
the
king's
house
judging
the
people
of
the
land
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
uzziah
first
and
last
did
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
write
so
uzziah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
field
of
the
burial
which
belonged
to
the
kings
for
they
said
he
is
a
leper
and
jotham
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
jotham
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
jerushah
the
daughter
of
zadok
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
his
father
uzziah
did
howbeit
he
entered
not
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
the
people
did
yet
corruptly
he
built
the
high
gate
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
on
the
wall
of
ophel
he
built
much
moreover
he
built
cities
in
the
mountains
of
judah
and
in
the
forests
he
built
castles
and
towers
he
fought
also
with
the
king
of
the
ammonites
and
prevailed
against
them
and
the
children
of
ammon
gave
him
the
same
year
an
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
ten
thousand
measures
of
wheat
and
ten
thousand
of
barley
so
much
did
the
children
of
ammon
pay
unto
him
both
the
second
year
and
the
third
so
jotham
became
mighty
because
he
prepared
his
ways
before
the
lord
his
god
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jotham
and
all
his
wars
and
his
ways
lo
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
and
jotham
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
ahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
ahaz
was
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
sixteen
years
in
jerusalem
but
he
did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
david
his
father
for
he
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
made
also
molten
images
for
baalim
moreover
he
burnt
incense
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
and
burnt
his
children
in
the
fire
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
he
sacrificed
also
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places
and
on
the
hills
and
under
every
green
tree
wherefore
the
lord
his
god
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
and
they
smote
him
and
carried
away
a
great
multitude
of
them
captives
and
brought
them
to
damascus
and
he
was
also
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
israel
who
smote
him
with
a
great
slaughter
for
pekah
the
son
of
remaliah
slew
in
judah
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
in
one
day
which
were
all
valiant
men
because
they
had
forsaken
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
zichri
a
mighty
man
of
ephraim
slew
maaseiah
the
king's
son
and
azrikam
the
governor
of
the
house
and
elkanah
that
was
next
to
the
king
and
the
children
of
israel
carried
away
captive
of
their
brethren
two
hundred
thousand
women
sons
and
daughters
and
took
also
away
much
spoil
from
them
and
brought
the
spoil
to
samaria
but
a
prophet
of
the
lord
was
there
whose
name
was
oded
and
he
went
out
before
the
host
that
came
to
samaria
and
said
unto
them
behold
because
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
was
wroth
with
judah
he
hath
delivered
them
into
your
hand
and
ye
have
slain
them
in
a
rage
that
reacheth
up
unto
heaven
and
now
ye
purpose
to
keep
under
the
children
of
judah
and
jerusalem
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
unto
you
but
are
there
not
with
you
even
with
you
sins
against
the
lord
your
god
now
hear
me
therefore
and
deliver
the
captives
again
which
ye
have
taken
captive
of
your
brethren
for
the
fierce
wrath
of
the
lord
is
upon
you
then
certain
of
the
heads
of
the
children
of
ephraim
azariah
the
son
of
johanan
berechiah
the
son
of
meshillemoth
and
jehizkiah
the
son
of
shallum
and
amasa
the
son
of
hadlai
stood
up
against
them
that
came
from
the
war
and
said
unto
them
ye
shall
not
bring
in
the
captives
hither
for
whereas
we
have
offended
against
the
lord
already
ye
intend
to
add
more
to
our
sins
and
to
our
trespass
for
our
trespass
is
great
and
there
is
fierce
wrath
against
israel
so
the
armed
men
left
the
captives
and
the
spoil
before
the
princes
and
all
the
congregation
and
the
men
which
were
expressed
by
name
rose
up
and
took
the
captives
and
with
the
spoil
clothed
all
that
were
naked
among
them
and
arrayed
them
and
shod
them
and
gave
them
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
anointed
them
and
carried
all
the
feeble
of
them
upon
asses
and
brought
them
to
jericho
the
city
of
palm
trees
to
their
brethren
then
they
returned
to
samaria
at
that
time
did
king
ahaz
send
unto
the
kings
of
assyria
to
help
him
for
again
the
edomites
had
come
and
smitten
judah
and
carried
away
captives
the
philistines
also
had
invaded
the
cities
of
the
low
country
and
of
the
south
of
judah
and
had
taken
bethshemesh
and
ajalon
and
gederoth
and
shocho
with
the
villages
thereof
and
timnah
with
the
villages
thereof
gimzo
also
and
the
villages
thereof
and
they
dwelt
there
for
the
lord
brought
judah
low
because
of
ahaz
king
of
israel
for
he
made
judah
naked
and
transgressed
sore
against
the
lord
and
tilgathpilneser
king
of
assyria
came
unto
him
and
distressed
him
but
strengthened
him
not
for
ahaz
took
away
a
portion
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
out
of
the
house
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes
and
gave
it
unto
the
king
of
assyria
but
he
helped
him
not
and
in
the
time
of
his
distress
did
he
trespass
yet
more
against
the
lord
this
is
that
king
ahaz
for
he
sacrificed
unto
the
gods
of
damascus
which
smote
him
and
he
said
because
the
gods
of
the
kings
of
syria
help
them
therefore
will
i
sacrifice
to
them
that
they
may
help
me
but
they
were
the
ruin
of
him
and
of
all
israel
and
ahaz
gathered
together
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
and
cut
in
pieces
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
and
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
made
him
altars
in
every
corner
of
jerusalem
and
in
every
several
city
of
judah
he
made
high
places
to
burn
incense
unto
other
gods
and
provoked
to
anger
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
now
the
rest
of
his
acts
and
of
all
his
ways
first
and
last
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
and
ahaz
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
even
in
jerusalem
but
they
brought
him
not
into
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
hezekiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
hezekiah
began
to
reign
when
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
old
and
he
reigned
nine
and
twenty
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
abijah
the
daughter
of
zechariah
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
david
his
father
had
done
he
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
in
the
first
month
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
repaired
them
and
he
brought
in
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
gathered
them
together
into
the
east
street
and
said
unto
them
hear
me
ye
levites
sanctify
now
yourselves
and
sanctify
the
house
of
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
and
carry
forth
the
filthiness
out
of
the
holy
place
for
our
fathers
have
trespassed
and
done
that
which
was
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
our
god
and
have
forsaken
him
and
have
turned
away
their
faces
from
the
habitation
of
the
lord
and
turned
their
backs
also
they
have
shut
up
the
doors
of
the
porch
and
put
out
the
lamps
and
have
not
burned
incense
nor
offered
burnt
offerings
in
the
holy
place
unto
the
god
of
israel
wherefore
the
wrath
of
the
lord
was
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
and
he
hath
delivered
them
to
trouble
to
astonishment
and
to
hissing
as
ye
see
with
your
eyes
for
lo
our
fathers
have
fallen
by
the
sword
and
our
sons
and
our
daughters
and
our
wives
are
in
captivity
for
this
now
it
is
in
mine
heart
to
make
a
covenant
with
the
lord
god
of
israel
that
his
fierce
wrath
may
turn
away
from
us
my
sons
be
not
now
negligent
for
the
lord
hath
chosen
you
to
stand
before
him
to
serve
him
and
that
ye
should
minister
unto
him
and
burn
incense
then
the
levites
arose
mahath
the
son
of
amasai
and
joel
the
son
of
azariah
of
the
sons
of
the
kohathites
and
of
the
sons
of
merari
kish
the
son
of
abdi
and
azariah
the
son
of
jehalelel
and
of
the
gershonites
joah
the
son
of
zimmah
and
eden
the
son
of
joah
and
of
the
sons
of
elizaphan
shimri
and
jeiel
and
of
the
sons
of
asaph
zechariah
and
mattaniah
and
of
the
sons
of
heman
jehiel
and
shimei
and
of
the
sons
of
jeduthun
shemaiah
and
uzziel
and
they
gathered
their
brethren
and
sanctified
themselves
and
came
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king
by
the
words
of
the
lord
to
cleanse
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
priests
went
into
the
inner
part
of
the
house
of
the
lord
to
cleanse
it
and
brought
out
all
the
uncleanness
that
they
found
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
into
the
court
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
levites
took
it
to
carry
it
out
abroad
into
the
brook
kidron
now
they
began
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
to
sanctify
and
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
month
came
they
to
the
porch
of
the
lord
so
they
sanctified
the
house
of
the
lord
in
eight
days
and
in
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
they
made
an
end
then
they
went
in
to
hezekiah
the
king
and
said
we
have
cleansed
all
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
with
all
the
vessels
thereof
and
the
shewbread
table
with
all
the
vessels
thereof
moreover
all
the
vessels
which
king
ahaz
in
his
reign
did
cast
away
in
his
transgression
have
we
prepared
and
sanctified
and
behold
they
are
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
then
hezekiah
the
king
rose
early
and
gathered
the
rulers
of
the
city
and
went
up
to
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
brought
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
and
seven
lambs
and
seven
he
goats
for
a
sin
offering
for
the
kingdom
and
for
the
sanctuary
and
for
judah
and
he
commanded
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
to
offer
them
on
the
altar
of
the
lord
so
they
killed
the
bullocks
and
the
priests
received
the
blood
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
altar
likewise
when
they
had
killed
the
rams
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
they
killed
also
the
lambs
and
they
sprinkled
the
blood
upon
the
altar
and
they
brought
forth
the
he
goats
for
the
sin
offering
before
the
king
and
the
congregation
and
they
laid
their
hands
upon
them
and
the
priests
killed
them
and
they
made
reconciliation
with
their
blood
upon
the
altar
to
make
an
atonement
for
all
israel
for
the
king
commanded
that
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
should
be
made
for
all
israel
and
he
set
the
levites
in
the
house
of
the
lord
with
cymbals
with
psalteries
and
with
harps
according
to
the
commandment
of
david
and
of
gad
the
king's
seer
and
nathan
the
prophet
for
so
was
the
commandment
of
the
lord
by
his
prophets
and
the
levites
stood
with
the
instruments
of
david
and
the
priests
with
the
trumpets
and
hezekiah
commanded
to
offer
the
burnt
offering
upon
the
altar
and
when
the
burnt
offering
began
the
song
of
the
lord
began
also
with
the
trumpets
and
with
the
instruments
ordained
by
david
king
of
israel
and
all
the
congregation
worshipped
and
the
singers
sang
and
the
trumpeters
sounded
and
all
this
continued
until
the
burnt
offering
was
finished
and
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
king
and
all
that
were
present
with
him
bowed
themselves
and
worshipped
moreover
hezekiah
the
king
and
the
princes
commanded
the
levites
to
sing
praise
unto
the
lord
with
the
words
of
david
and
of
asaph
the
seer
and
they
sang
praises
with
gladness
and
they
bowed
their
heads
and
worshipped
then
hezekiah
answered
and
said
now
ye
have
consecrated
yourselves
unto
the
lord
come
near
and
bring
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
congregation
brought
in
sacrifices
and
thank
offerings
and
as
many
as
were
of
a
free
heart
burnt
offerings
and
the
number
of
the
burnt
offerings
which
the
congregation
brought
was
threescore
and
ten
bullocks
an
hundred
rams
and
two
hundred
lambs
all
these
were
for
a
burnt
offering
to
the
lord
and
the
consecrated
things
were
six
hundred
oxen
and
three
thousand
sheep
but
the
priests
were
too
few
so
that
they
could
not
flay
all
the
burnt
offerings
wherefore
their
brethren
the
levites
did
help
them
till
the
work
was
ended
and
until
the
other
priests
had
sanctified
themselves
for
the
levites
were
more
upright
in
heart
to
sanctify
themselves
than
the
priests
and
also
the
burnt
offerings
were
in
abundance
with
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
and
the
drink
offerings
for
every
burnt
offering
so
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
was
set
in
order
and
hezekiah
rejoiced
and
all
the
people
that
god
had
prepared
the
people
for
the
thing
was
done
suddenly
and
hezekiah
sent
to
all
israel
and
judah
and
wrote
letters
also
to
ephraim
and
manasseh
that
they
should
come
to
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
for
the
king
had
taken
counsel
and
his
princes
and
all
the
congregation
in
jerusalem
to
keep
the
passover
in
the
second
month
for
they
could
not
keep
it
at
that
time
because
the
priests
had
not
sanctified
themselves
sufficiently
neither
had
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
to
jerusalem
and
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
all
the
congregation
so
they
established
a
decree
to
make
proclamation
throughout
all
israel
from
beersheba
even
to
dan
that
they
should
come
to
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
at
jerusalem
for
they
had
not
done
it
of
a
long
time
in
such
sort
as
it
was
written
so
the
posts
went
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
throughout
all
israel
and
judah
and
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king
saying
ye
children
of
israel
turn
again
unto
the
lord
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
israel
and
he
will
return
to
the
remnant
of
you
that
are
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
assyria
and
be
not
ye
like
your
fathers
and
like
your
brethren
which
trespassed
against
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
who
therefore
gave
them
up
to
desolation
as
ye
see
now
be
ye
not
stiffnecked
as
your
fathers
were
but
yield
yourselves
unto
the
lord
and
enter
into
his
sanctuary
which
he
hath
sanctified
for
ever
and
serve
the
lord
your
god
that
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
may
turn
away
from
you
for
if
ye
turn
again
unto
the
lord
your
brethren
and
your
children
shall
find
compassion
before
them
that
lead
them
captive
so
that
they
shall
come
again
into
this
land
for
the
lord
your
god
is
gracious
and
merciful
and
will
not
turn
away
his
face
from
you
if
ye
return
unto
him
so
the
posts
passed
from
city
to
city
through
the
country
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
even
unto
zebulun
but
they
laughed
them
to
scorn
and
mocked
them
nevertheless
divers
of
asher
and
manasseh
and
of
zebulun
humbled
themselves
and
came
to
jerusalem
also
in
judah
the
hand
of
god
was
to
give
them
one
heart
to
do
the
commandment
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes
by
the
word
of
the
lord
and
there
assembled
at
jerusalem
much
people
to
keep
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
in
the
second
month
a
very
great
congregation
and
they
arose
and
took
away
the
altars
that
were
in
jerusalem
and
all
the
altars
for
incense
took
they
away
and
cast
them
into
the
brook
kidron
then
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
second
month
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
were
ashamed
and
sanctified
themselves
and
brought
in
the
burnt
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
stood
in
their
place
after
their
manner
according
to
the
law
of
moses
the
man
of
god
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
which
they
received
of
the
hand
of
the
levites
for
there
were
many
in
the
congregation
that
were
not
sanctified
therefore
the
levites
had
the
charge
of
the
killing
of
the
passovers
for
every
one
that
was
not
clean
to
sanctify
them
unto
the
lord
for
a
multitude
of
the
people
even
many
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
issachar
and
zebulun
had
not
cleansed
themselves
yet
did
they
eat
the
passover
otherwise
than
it
was
written
but
hezekiah
prayed
for
them
saying
the
good
lord
pardon
every
one
that
prepareth
his
heart
to
seek
god
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
though
he
be
not
cleansed
according
to
the
purification
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
lord
hearkened
to
hezekiah
and
healed
the
people
and
the
children
of
israel
that
were
present
at
jerusalem
kept
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
with
great
gladness
and
the
levites
and
the
priests
praised
the
lord
day
by
day
singing
with
loud
instruments
unto
the
lord
and
hezekiah
spake
comfortably
unto
all
the
levites
that
taught
the
good
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
they
did
eat
throughout
the
feast
seven
days
offering
peace
offerings
and
making
confession
to
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
and
the
whole
assembly
took
counsel
to
keep
other
seven
days
and
they
kept
other
seven
days
with
gladness
for
hezekiah
king
of
judah
did
give
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
seven
thousand
sheep
and
the
princes
gave
to
the
congregation
a
thousand
bullocks
and
ten
thousand
sheep
and
a
great
number
of
priests
sanctified
themselves
and
all
the
congregation
of
judah
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
the
congregation
that
came
out
of
israel
and
the
strangers
that
came
out
of
the
land
of
israel
and
that
dwelt
in
judah
rejoiced
so
there
was
great
joy
in
jerusalem
for
since
the
time
of
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
of
israel
there
was
not
the
like
in
jerusalem
then
the
priests
the
levites
arose
and
blessed
the
people
and
their
voice
was
heard
and
their
prayer
came
up
to
his
holy
dwelling
place
even
unto
heaven
now
when
all
this
was
finished
all
israel
that
were
present
went
out
to
the
cities
of
judah
and
brake
the
images
in
pieces
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
threw
down
the
high
places
and
the
altars
out
of
all
judah
and
benjamin
in
ephraim
also
and
manasseh
until
they
had
utterly
destroyed
them
all
then
all
the
children
of
israel
returned
every
man
to
his
possession
into
their
own
cities
and
hezekiah
appointed
the
courses
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
after
their
courses
every
man
according
to
his
service
the
priests
and
levites
for
burnt
offerings
and
for
peace
offerings
to
minister
and
to
give
thanks
and
to
praise
in
the
gates
of
the
tents
of
the
lord
he
appointed
also
the
king's
portion
of
his
substance
for
the
burnt
offerings
to
wit
for
the
morning
and
evening
burnt
offerings
and
the
burnt
offerings
for
the
sabbaths
and
for
the
new
moons
and
for
the
set
feasts
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
the
lord
moreover
he
commanded
the
people
that
dwelt
in
jerusalem
to
give
the
portion
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
that
they
might
be
encouraged
in
the
law
of
the
lord
and
as
soon
as
the
commandment
came
abroad
the
children
of
israel
brought
in
abundance
the
firstfruits
of
corn
wine
and
oil
and
honey
and
of
all
the
increase
of
the
field
and
the
tithe
of
all
things
brought
they
in
abundantly
and
concerning
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
that
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
they
also
brought
in
the
tithe
of
oxen
and
sheep
and
the
tithe
of
holy
things
which
were
consecrated
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
laid
them
by
heaps
in
the
third
month
they
began
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
heaps
and
finished
them
in
the
seventh
month
and
when
hezekiah
and
the
princes
came
and
saw
the
heaps
they
blessed
the
lord
and
his
people
israel
then
hezekiah
questioned
with
the
priests
and
the
levites
concerning
the
heaps
and
azariah
the
chief
priest
of
the
house
of
zadok
answered
him
and
said
since
the
people
began
to
bring
the
offerings
into
the
house
of
the
lord
we
have
had
enough
to
eat
and
have
left
plenty
for
the
lord
hath
blessed
his
people
and
that
which
is
left
is
this
great
store
then
hezekiah
commanded
to
prepare
chambers
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
prepared
them
and
brought
in
the
offerings
and
the
tithes
and
the
dedicated
things
faithfully
over
which
cononiah
the
levite
was
ruler
and
shimei
his
brother
was
the
next
and
jehiel
and
azaziah
and
nahath
and
asahel
and
jerimoth
and
jozabad
and
eliel
and
ismachiah
and
mahath
and
benaiah
were
overseers
under
the
hand
of
cononiah
and
shimei
his
brother
at
the
commandment
of
hezekiah
the
king
and
azariah
the
ruler
of
the
house
of
god
and
kore
the
son
of
imnah
the
levite
the
porter
toward
the
east
was
over
the
freewill
offerings
of
god
to
distribute
the
oblations
of
the
lord
and
the
most
holy
things
and
next
him
were
eden
and
miniamin
and
jeshua
and
shemaiah
amariah
and
shecaniah
in
the
cities
of
the
priests
in
their
set
office
to
give
to
their
brethren
by
courses
as
well
to
the
great
as
to
the
small
beside
their
genealogy
of
males
from
three
years
old
and
upward
even
unto
every
one
that
entereth
into
the
house
of
the
lord
his
daily
portion
for
their
service
in
their
charges
according
to
their
courses
both
to
the
genealogy
of
the
priests
by
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
the
levites
from
twenty
years
old
and
upward
in
their
charges
by
their
courses
and
to
the
genealogy
of
all
their
little
ones
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
through
all
the
congregation
for
in
their
set
office
they
sanctified
themselves
in
holiness
also
of
the
sons
of
aaron
the
priests
which
were
in
the
fields
of
the
suburbs
of
their
cities
in
every
several
city
the
men
that
were
expressed
by
name
to
give
portions
to
all
the
males
among
the
priests
and
to
all
that
were
reckoned
by
genealogies
among
the
levites
and
thus
did
hezekiah
throughout
all
judah
and
wrought
that
which
was
good
and
right
and
truth
before
the
lord
his
god
and
in
every
work
that
he
began
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
god
and
in
the
law
and
in
the
commandments
to
seek
his
god
he
did
it
with
all
his
heart
and
prospered
after
these
things
and
the
establishment
thereof
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
came
and
entered
into
judah
and
encamped
against
the
fenced
cities
and
thought
to
win
them
for
himself
and
when
hezekiah
saw
that
sennacherib
was
come
and
that
he
was
purposed
to
fight
against
jerusalem
he
took
counsel
with
his
princes
and
his
mighty
men
to
stop
the
waters
of
the
fountains
which
were
without
the
city
and
they
did
help
him
so
there
was
gathered
much
people
together
who
stopped
all
the
fountains
and
the
brook
that
ran
through
the
midst
of
the
land
saying
why
should
the
kings
of
assyria
come
and
find
much
water
also
he
strengthened
himself
and
built
up
all
the
wall
that
was
broken
and
raised
it
up
to
the
towers
and
another
wall
without
and
repaired
millo
in
the
city
of
david
and
made
darts
and
shields
in
abundance
and
he
set
captains
of
war
over
the
people
and
gathered
them
together
to
him
in
the
street
of
the
gate
of
the
city
and
spake
comfortably
to
them
saying
be
strong
and
courageous
be
not
afraid
nor
dismayed
for
the
king
of
assyria
nor
for
all
the
multitude
that
is
with
him
for
there
be
more
with
us
than
with
him
with
him
is
an
arm
of
flesh
but
with
us
is
the
lord
our
god
to
help
us
and
to
fight
our
battles
and
the
people
rested
themselves
upon
the
words
of
hezekiah
king
of
judah
after
this
did
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
send
his
servants
to
jerusalem
but
he
himself
laid
siege
against
lachish
and
all
his
power
with
him
unto
hezekiah
king
of
judah
and
unto
all
judah
that
were
at
jerusalem
saying
thus
saith
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
whereon
do
ye
trust
that
ye
abide
in
the
siege
in
jerusalem
doth
not
hezekiah
persuade
you
to
give
over
yourselves
to
die
by
famine
and
by
thirst
saying
the
lord
our
god
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
hath
not
the
same
hezekiah
taken
away
his
high
places
and
his
altars
and
commanded
judah
and
jerusalem
saying
ye
shall
worship
before
one
altar
and
burn
incense
upon
it
know
ye
not
what
i
and
my
fathers
have
done
unto
all
the
people
of
other
lands
were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
those
lands
any
ways
able
to
deliver
their
lands
out
of
mine
hand
who
was
there
among
all
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
my
fathers
utterly
destroyed
that
could
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
that
your
god
should
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand
now
therefore
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
nor
persuade
you
on
this
manner
neither
yet
believe
him
for
no
god
of
any
nation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
and
out
of
the
hand
of
my
fathers
how
much
less
shall
your
god
deliver
you
out
of
mine
hand
and
his
servants
spake
yet
more
against
the
lord
god
and
against
his
servant
hezekiah
he
wrote
also
letters
to
rail
on
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
to
speak
against
him
saying
as
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
other
lands
have
not
delivered
their
people
out
of
mine
hand
so
shall
not
the
god
of
hezekiah
deliver
his
people
out
of
mine
hand
then
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews
speech
unto
the
people
of
jerusalem
that
were
on
the
wall
to
affright
them
and
to
trouble
them
that
they
might
take
the
city
and
they
spake
against
the
god
of
jerusalem
as
against
the
gods
of
the
people
of
the
earth
which
were
the
work
of
the
hands
of
man
and
for
this
cause
hezekiah
the
king
and
the
prophet
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
prayed
and
cried
to
heaven
and
the
lord
sent
an
angel
which
cut
off
all
the
mighty
men
of
valour
and
the
leaders
and
captains
in
the
camp
of
the
king
of
assyria
so
he
returned
with
shame
of
face
to
his
own
land
and
when
he
was
come
into
the
house
of
his
god
they
that
came
forth
of
his
own
bowels
slew
him
there
with
the
sword
thus
the
lord
saved
hezekiah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
from
the
hand
of
sennacherib
the
king
of
assyria
and
from
the
hand
of
all
other
and
guided
them
on
every
side
and
many
brought
gifts
unto
the
lord
to
jerusalem
and
presents
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
so
that
he
was
magnified
in
the
sight
of
all
nations
from
thenceforth
in
those
days
hezekiah
was
sick
to
the
death
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
he
spake
unto
him
and
he
gave
him
a
sign
but
hezekiah
rendered
not
again
according
to
the
benefit
done
unto
him
for
his
heart
was
lifted
up
therefore
there
was
wrath
upon
him
and
upon
judah
and
jerusalem
notwithstanding
hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
pride
of
his
heart
both
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
so
that
the
wrath
of
the
lord
came
not
upon
them
in
the
days
of
hezekiah
and
hezekiah
had
exceeding
much
riches
and
honour
and
he
made
himself
treasuries
for
silver
and
for
gold
and
for
precious
stones
and
for
spices
and
for
shields
and
for
all
manner
of
pleasant
jewels
storehouses
also
for
the
increase
of
corn
and
wine
and
oil
and
stalls
for
all
manner
of
beasts
and
cotes
for
flocks
moreover
he
provided
him
cities
and
possessions
of
flocks
and
herds
in
abundance
for
god
had
given
him
substance
very
much
this
same
hezekiah
also
stopped
the
upper
watercourse
of
gihon
and
brought
it
straight
down
to
the
west
side
of
the
city
of
david
and
hezekiah
prospered
in
all
his
works
howbeit
in
the
business
of
the
ambassadors
of
the
princes
of
babylon
who
sent
unto
him
to
enquire
of
the
wonder
that
was
done
in
the
land
god
left
him
to
try
him
that
he
might
know
all
that
was
in
his
heart
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
hezekiah
and
his
goodness
behold
they
are
written
in
the
vision
of
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
and
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
israel
and
hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
chiefest
of
the
sepulchres
of
the
sons
of
david
and
all
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
did
him
honour
at
his
death
and
manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
but
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
like
unto
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
for
he
built
again
the
high
places
which
hezekiah
his
father
had
broken
down
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
baalim
and
made
groves
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
them
also
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
lord
whereof
the
lord
had
said
in
jerusalem
shall
my
name
be
for
ever
and
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
caused
his
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
also
he
observed
times
and
used
enchantments
and
used
witchcraft
and
dealt
with
a
familiar
spirit
and
with
wizards
he
wrought
much
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
and
he
set
a
carved
image
the
idol
which
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
god
of
which
god
had
said
to
david
and
to
solomon
his
son
in
this
house
and
in
jerusalem
which
i
have
chosen
before
all
the
tribes
of
israel
will
i
put
my
name
for
ever
neither
will
i
any
more
remove
the
foot
of
israel
from
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
appointed
for
your
fathers
so
that
they
will
take
heed
to
do
all
that
i
have
commanded
them
according
to
the
whole
law
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
by
the
hand
of
moses
so
manasseh
made
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
err
and
to
do
worse
than
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
had
destroyed
before
the
children
of
israel
and
the
lord
spake
to
manasseh
and
to
his
people
but
they
would
not
hearken
wherefore
the
lord
brought
upon
them
the
captains
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
assyria
which
took
manasseh
among
the
thorns
and
bound
him
with
fetters
and
carried
him
to
babylon
and
when
he
was
in
affliction
he
besought
the
lord
his
god
and
humbled
himself
greatly
before
the
god
of
his
fathers
and
prayed
unto
him
and
he
was
intreated
of
him
and
heard
his
supplication
and
brought
him
again
to
jerusalem
into
his
kingdom
then
manasseh
knew
that
the
lord
he
was
god
now
after
this
he
built
a
wall
without
the
city
of
david
on
the
west
side
of
gihon
in
the
valley
even
to
the
entering
in
at
the
fish
gate
and
compassed
about
ophel
and
raised
it
up
a
very
great
height
and
put
captains
of
war
in
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
and
he
took
away
the
strange
gods
and
the
idol
out
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
altars
that
he
had
built
in
the
mount
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
jerusalem
and
cast
them
out
of
the
city
and
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
lord
and
sacrificed
thereon
peace
offerings
and
thank
offerings
and
commanded
judah
to
serve
the
lord
god
of
israel
nevertheless
the
people
did
sacrifice
still
in
the
high
places
yet
unto
the
lord
their
god
only
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
manasseh
and
his
prayer
unto
his
god
and
the
words
of
the
seers
that
spake
to
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
his
prayer
also
and
how
god
was
intreated
of
him
and
all
his
sins
and
his
trespass
and
the
places
wherein
he
built
high
places
and
set
up
groves
and
graven
images
before
he
was
humbled
behold
they
are
written
among
the
sayings
of
the
seers
so
manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
his
own
house
and
amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
amon
was
two
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
two
years
in
jerusalem
but
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
did
manasseh
his
father
for
amon
sacrificed
unto
all
the
carved
images
which
manasseh
his
father
had
made
and
served
them
and
humbled
not
himself
before
the
lord
as
manasseh
his
father
had
humbled
himself
but
amon
trespassed
more
and
more
and
his
servants
conspired
against
him
and
slew
him
in
his
own
house
but
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
amon
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead
josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
in
jerusalem
one
and
thirty
years
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
david
his
father
and
declined
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
for
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign
while
he
was
yet
young
he
began
to
seek
after
the
god
of
david
his
father
and
in
the
twelfth
year
he
began
to
purge
judah
and
jerusalem
from
the
high
places
and
the
groves
and
the
carved
images
and
the
molten
images
and
they
brake
down
the
altars
of
baalim
in
his
presence
and
the
images
that
were
on
high
above
them
he
cut
down
and
the
groves
and
the
carved
images
and
the
molten
images
he
brake
in
pieces
and
made
dust
of
them
and
strowed
it
upon
the
graves
of
them
that
had
sacrificed
unto
them
and
he
burnt
the
bones
of
the
priests
upon
their
altars
and
cleansed
judah
and
jerusalem
and
so
did
he
in
the
cities
of
manasseh
and
ephraim
and
simeon
even
unto
naphtali
with
their
mattocks
round
about
and
when
he
had
broken
down
the
altars
and
the
groves
and
had
beaten
the
graven
images
into
powder
and
cut
down
all
the
idols
throughout
all
the
land
of
israel
he
returned
to
jerusalem
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
when
he
had
purged
the
land
and
the
house
he
sent
shaphan
the
son
of
azaliah
and
maaseiah
the
governor
of
the
city
and
joah
the
son
of
joahaz
the
recorder
to
repair
the
house
of
the
lord
his
god
and
when
they
came
to
hilkiah
the
high
priest
they
delivered
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
god
which
the
levites
that
kept
the
doors
had
gathered
of
the
hand
of
manasseh
and
ephraim
and
of
all
the
remnant
of
israel
and
of
all
judah
and
benjamin
and
they
returned
to
jerusalem
and
they
put
it
in
the
hand
of
the
workmen
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
gave
it
to
the
workmen
that
wrought
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
repair
and
amend
the
house
even
to
the
artificers
and
builders
gave
they
it
to
buy
hewn
stone
and
timber
for
couplings
and
to
floor
the
houses
which
the
kings
of
judah
had
destroyed
and
the
men
did
the
work
faithfully
and
the
overseers
of
them
were
jahath
and
obadiah
the
levites
of
the
sons
of
merari
and
zechariah
and
meshullam
of
the
sons
of
the
kohathites
to
set
it
forward
and
other
of
the
levites
all
that
could
skill
of
instruments
of
musick
also
they
were
over
the
bearers
of
burdens
and
were
overseers
of
all
that
wrought
the
work
in
any
manner
of
service
and
of
the
levites
there
were
scribes
and
officers
and
porters
and
when
they
brought
out
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
hilkiah
the
priest
found
a
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
given
by
moses
and
hilkiah
answered
and
said
to
shaphan
the
scribe
i
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hilkiah
delivered
the
book
to
shaphan
and
shaphan
carried
the
book
to
the
king
and
brought
the
king
word
back
again
saying
all
that
was
committed
to
thy
servants
they
do
it
and
they
have
gathered
together
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
the
overseers
and
to
the
hand
of
the
workmen
then
shaphan
the
scribe
told
the
king
saying
hilkiah
the
priest
hath
given
me
a
book
and
shaphan
read
it
before
the
king
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
law
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
and
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
abdon
the
son
of
micah
and
shaphan
the
scribe
and
asaiah
a
servant
of
the
king's
saying
go
enquire
of
the
lord
for
me
and
for
them
that
are
left
in
israel
and
in
judah
concerning
the
words
of
the
book
that
is
found
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
lord
that
is
poured
out
upon
us
because
our
fathers
have
not
kept
the
word
of
the
lord
to
do
after
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
and
hilkiah
and
they
that
the
king
had
appointed
went
to
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
the
son
of
tikvath
the
son
of
hasrah
keeper
of
the
wardrobe
now
she
dwelt
in
jerusalem
in
the
college
and
they
spake
to
her
to
that
effect
and
she
answered
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
tell
ye
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
the
book
which
they
have
read
before
the
king
of
judah
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
poured
out
upon
this
place
and
shall
not
be
quenched
and
as
for
the
king
of
judah
who
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
lord
so
shall
ye
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
concerning
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
because
thine
heart
was
tender
and
thou
didst
humble
thyself
before
god
when
thou
heardest
his
words
against
this
place
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
humbledst
thyself
before
me
and
didst
rend
thy
clothes
and
weep
before
me
i
have
even
heard
thee
also
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
gather
thee
to
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
to
thy
grave
in
peace
neither
shall
thine
eyes
see
all
the
evil
that
i
will
bring
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
so
they
brought
the
king
word
again
then
the
king
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
elders
of
judah
and
jerusalem
and
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
the
people
great
and
small
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king
stood
in
his
place
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
to
walk
after
the
lord
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
to
perform
the
words
of
the
covenant
which
are
written
in
this
book
and
he
caused
all
that
were
present
in
jerusalem
and
benjamin
to
stand
to
it
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
did
according
to
the
covenant
of
god
the
god
of
their
fathers
and
josiah
took
away
all
the
abominations
out
of
all
the
countries
that
pertained
to
the
children
of
israel
and
made
all
that
were
present
in
israel
to
serve
even
to
serve
the
lord
their
god
and
all
his
days
they
departed
not
from
following
the
lord
the
god
of
their
fathers
moreover
josiah
kept
a
passover
unto
the
lord
in
jerusalem
and
they
killed
the
passover
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
he
set
the
priests
in
their
charges
and
encouraged
them
to
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
said
unto
the
levites
that
taught
all
israel
which
were
holy
unto
the
lord
put
the
holy
ark
in
the
house
which
solomon
the
son
of
david
king
of
israel
did
build
it
shall
not
be
a
burden
upon
your
shoulders
serve
now
the
lord
your
god
and
his
people
israel
and
prepare
yourselves
by
the
houses
of
your
fathers
after
your
courses
according
to
the
writing
of
david
king
of
israel
and
according
to
the
writing
of
solomon
his
son
and
stand
in
the
holy
place
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
families
of
the
fathers
of
your
brethren
the
people
and
after
the
division
of
the
families
of
the
levites
so
kill
the
passover
and
sanctify
yourselves
and
prepare
your
brethren
that
they
may
do
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
josiah
gave
to
the
people
of
the
flock
lambs
and
kids
all
for
the
passover
offerings
for
all
that
were
present
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
and
three
thousand
bullocks
these
were
of
the
king's
substance
and
his
princes
gave
willingly
unto
the
people
to
the
priests
and
to
the
levites
hilkiah
and
zechariah
and
jehiel
rulers
of
the
house
of
god
gave
unto
the
priests
for
the
passover
offerings
two
thousand
and
six
hundred
small
cattle
and
three
hundred
oxen
conaniah
also
and
shemaiah
and
nethaneel
his
brethren
and
hashabiah
and
jeiel
and
jozabad
chief
of
the
levites
gave
unto
the
levites
for
passover
offerings
five
thousand
small
cattle
and
five
hundred
oxen
so
the
service
was
prepared
and
the
priests
stood
in
their
place
and
the
levites
in
their
courses
according
to
the
king's
commandment
and
they
killed
the
passover
and
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
from
their
hands
and
the
levites
flayed
them
and
they
removed
the
burnt
offerings
that
they
might
give
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
families
of
the
people
to
offer
unto
the
lord
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
moses
and
so
did
they
with
the
oxen
and
they
roasted
the
passover
with
fire
according
to
the
ordinance
but
the
other
holy
offerings
sod
they
in
pots
and
in
caldrons
and
in
pans
and
divided
them
speedily
among
all
the
people
and
afterward
they
made
ready
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
because
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
were
busied
in
offering
of
burnt
offerings
and
the
fat
until
night
therefore
the
levites
prepared
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
singers
the
sons
of
asaph
were
in
their
place
according
to
the
commandment
of
david
and
asaph
and
heman
and
jeduthun
the
king's
seer
and
the
porters
waited
at
every
gate
they
might
not
depart
from
their
service
for
their
brethren
the
levites
prepared
for
them
so
all
the
service
of
the
lord
was
prepared
the
same
day
to
keep
the
passover
and
to
offer
burnt
offerings
upon
the
altar
of
the
lord
according
to
the
commandment
of
king
josiah
and
the
children
of
israel
that
were
present
kept
the
passover
at
that
time
and
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
seven
days
and
there
was
no
passover
like
to
that
kept
in
israel
from
the
days
of
samuel
the
prophet
neither
did
all
the
kings
of
israel
keep
such
a
passover
as
josiah
kept
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
all
judah
and
israel
that
were
present
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
josiah
was
this
passover
kept
after
all
this
when
josiah
had
prepared
the
temple
necho
king
of
egypt
came
up
to
fight
against
charchemish
by
euphrates
and
josiah
went
out
against
him
but
he
sent
ambassadors
to
him
saying
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
thou
king
of
judah
i
come
not
against
thee
this
day
but
against
the
house
wherewith
i
have
war
for
god
commanded
me
to
make
haste
forbear
thee
from
meddling
with
god
who
is
with
me
that
he
destroy
thee
not
nevertheless
josiah
would
not
turn
his
face
from
him
but
disguised
himself
that
he
might
fight
with
him
and
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
necho
from
the
mouth
of
god
and
came
to
fight
in
the
valley
of
megiddo
and
the
archers
shot
at
king
josiah
and
the
king
said
to
his
servants
have
me
away
for
i
am
sore
wounded
his
servants
therefore
took
him
out
of
that
chariot
and
put
him
in
the
second
chariot
that
he
had
and
they
brought
him
to
jerusalem
and
he
died
and
was
buried
in
one
of
the
sepulchres
of
his
fathers
and
all
judah
and
jerusalem
mourned
for
josiah
and
jeremiah
lamented
for
josiah
and
all
the
singing
men
and
the
singing
women
spake
of
josiah
in
their
lamentations
to
this
day
and
made
them
an
ordinance
in
israel
and
behold
they
are
written
in
the
lamentations
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
josiah
and
his
goodness
according

deeds
first
and
last
behold
they

in

book
of

put
him
down
at

and
condemned
the

in
an
hundred
talents

made

nebuchadnezzar
also
carried

of
the
house
of
the
lord
to

and
put
them
in
his
temple
at
babylon
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoiakim
and
his
abominations
which
he
did
and
that
which
was
found
in
him
behold
they

and
when
the
year
was
expired
king
nebuchadnezzar
sent
and
brought
him
to

zedekiah
was
one
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
began

reigned
eleven
years
in

and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in

of
the
lord
his
god
and
humbled
not
himself
before
jeremiah
the
prophet
speaking
from
the
mouth
of
the
lord
and
he
also
rebelled
against
king
nebuchadnezzar
who
had
made
him
swear
by
god
but
he
stiffened
his
neck
and
hardened
his
heart
from
turning
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
moreover
all
the
chief
of
the
priests
and
the
people
transgressed
very
much
after
all
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
and
polluted
the
house
of
the
lord
which
he
had
hallowed
in
jerusalem
and
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
sent
to
them
by
his
messengers
rising
up
betimes
and
sending
because
he
had
compassion
on
his
people
and
on
his
dwelling
place
but
they
mocked
the
messengers
of
god
and
despised
his
words
and
misused
his
prophets
until
the
wrath
of
the
lord
arose
against
his
people
till
there
was
no
remedy
therefore
he
brought
upon
them
the
king
of
the
chaldees
who
slew
their
young
men
with
the
sword
in
the
house
of
their
sanctuary
and
had
no
compassion
upon
young
man
or
maiden
old
man
or
him
that
stooped
for
age
he
gave
them
all
into
his
hand
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
great
and
small
and
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king
and
of
his
princes
all
these
he
brought
to

and
they
burnt
the

and
brake
down
the
wall
of

and
burnt
all
the

but
many
of
the
priests
and
levites
and
chief
of
the
fathers
who
were
ancient
men
that
had
seen
the
first
house
when
the
foundation
of
this
house
was
laid
before
their
eyes
wept
with
a
loud
voice
and
many
shouted
aloud
for
joy
so
that
the
people
could
not
discern
the
noise
of
the
shout
of
joy
from
the
noise
of
the
weeping
of
the
people
for
the
people
shouted
with
a
loud
shout
and
the
noise
was
heard
afar
off
now
when
the
adversaries
of
judah
and
benjamin
heard
that
the
children
of
the
captivity
builded
the
temple
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
then
they
came
to
zerubbabel
and
to
the
chief
of
the
fathers
and
said
unto
them
let
us
build
with
you
for
we
seek
your
god
as
ye
do
and
we
do
sacrifice
unto
him
since
the
days
of
esarhaddon
king
of
assur
which
brought
us
up
hither
but
zerubbabel
and
jeshua
and
the
rest
of
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
said
unto
them
ye
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
to
build
an
house
unto
our
god
but
we
ourselves
together
will
build
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
as
king
cyrus
the
king
of
persia
hath
commanded
us
then
the
people
of
the
land
weakened
the
hands
of
the
people
of
judah
and
troubled
them
in
building
and
hired
counsellors
against
them
to
frustrate
their
purpose
all
the
days
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
even
until
the
reign
of
darius
king
of
persia
and
in
the
reign
of
ahasuerus
in
the
beginning
of
his

wrote
they
unto
him
an
accusation
against
the
inhabitants
of

and
in

of
artaxerxes
wrote
bishlam
mithredath
tabeel
and
the
rest
of
their
companions
unto
artaxerxes
king
of
persia
and
the
writing
of
the
letter
was
written
in
the
syrian
tongue
and
interpreted
in
the
syrian
tongue
rehum
the
chancellor
and
shimshai
the
scribe
wrote
a
letter
against
jerusalem
to
artaxerxes
the
king
in
this
sort
then
wrote
rehum
the

the

and
the

of

whom
the

asnapper
brought
over
and
set
in
the
cities
of
samaria
and
the
rest
that
are
on

and
at
such
a
time
this
is
the

of
the
letter
that
they
sent
unto
him
even
unto
artaxerxes
the
king
thy
servants
the
men
on
this
side
the
river
and
at
such
a
time
be
it
known
unto
the
king
that
the
jews
which
came
up
from
thee
to
us
are
come
unto
jerusalem
building
the
rebellious
and
the
bad
city
and
have
set
up
the
walls
thereof
and
joined
the
foundations
be
it
known
now
unto
the
king
that
if
this
city
be
builded
and
the
walls
set
up
again
then
will
they
not
pay
toll
tribute
and
custom
and
so
thou
shalt
endamage
the
revenue
of
the
kings
now
because
we
have
maintenance
from
the
king's
palace
and
it
was
not
meet
for
us
to
see
the
king's
dishonour
therefore
have
we
sent
and
certified
the
king
that
search
may
be
made
in
the
book
of
the
records
of
thy
fathers
so
shalt
thou
find
in
the
book
of
the
records
and
know
that
this
city
is
a
rebellious
city
and
hurtful
unto
kings
and
provinces
and
that
they
have
moved
sedition
within
the
same
of
old
time
for
which
cause
was
this
city
destroyed
we
certify
the
king
that
if
this
city
be
builded
again
and
the
walls
thereof
set
up
by
this
means
thou
shalt
have
no
portion
on
this
side
the
river
then
sent
the
king
an
answer
unto
rehum
the
chancellor
and
to
shimshai
the
scribe
and
to
the
rest
of
their
companions
that
dwell
in
samaria
and
unto
the
rest
beyond
the
river
peace
and
at
such
a
time
the
letter
which
ye
sent
unto
us
hath
been
plainly
read
before
me
and
i
commanded
and
search
hath
been
made
and
it
is
found
that
this
city
of
old
time
hath
made
insurrection
against
kings
and
that
rebellion
and
sedition
have
been
made
therein
there
have
been
mighty
kings
also
over
jerusalem
which
have
ruled
over
all
countries
beyond
the
river
and
toll
tribute
and
custom
was
paid
unto
them
give
ye
now
commandment
to
cause
these
men
to
cease
and
that
this
city
be
not
builded
until
another
commandment
shall
be
given
from
me
take
heed
now
that
ye
fail
not
to
do
this
why
should
damage
grow
to
the
hurt
of
the
kings
now
when
the
copy
of
king
artaxerxes
letter
was
read
before
rehum
and
shimshai
the
scribe
and
their
companions
they
went
up
in
haste
to
jerusalem
unto
the
jews
and
made
them
to
cease
by
force
and
power
then
ceased
the
work
of
the
house
of
god
which
is
at
jerusalem
so
it
ceased
unto
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
darius
king
of
persia
then
the
prophets
haggai
the
prophet
and
zechariah
the
son
of

prophesied
unto
the
jews
that
were
in
judah
and
jerusalem
in
the
name
of
the
god
of

even
unto
them
then
rose
up
zerubbabel
the
son
of
shealtiel
and
jeshua
the
son
of
jozadak
and
began
to
build
the
house
of
god
which
is
at

and
with
them
were
the
prophets
of

helping
them
at
the
same
time
came
to
them
tatnai
governor
on
this

the

shetharboznai
and
their
companions
and
said
thus
unto
them
who
hath
commanded
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
make
up
this
wall
then
said
we
unto
them
after
this
manner
what
are
the
names
of
the
men
that
make
this
building
but
the
eye
of
their
god
was
upon
the
elders
of
the
jews
that
they
could
not
cause
them
to
cease
till
the
matter
came
to
darius
and
then
they
returned
answer
by
letter
concerning
this
matter
the
copy
of
the
letter
that
tatnai
governor
on
this

the

unto

wherein
was

thus
unto
darius
the

all
peace
be
it
known
unto
the

that
we
went
into
the

to
the

of
the
great

which
is
builded
with
great
stones
and
timber
is
laid
in
the
walls
and
this
work
goeth
fast
on
and
prospereth
in
their
hands
then
asked
we
those
elders
and
said
unto
them
thus
who
commanded
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
make
up
these
walls
we
asked
their
names
also
to
certify
thee
that
we
might
write
the
names
of
the
men
that
were
the
chief
of
them
and
thus
they
returned
us
answer
saying
we
are
the
servants
of
the
god
of
heaven
and
earth
and
build
the
house
that
was
builded
these
many

which
a
great

but
after
that
our

had
provoked
the

unto
wrath
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
nebuchadnezzar
the

ministers

by

upon

they
brought

a
man
of
understanding
of

two
hundred
and
twenty
nethinims
all
of
them
were
expressed
by
name
then
i
proclaimed
a
fast
there
at
the
river
of
ahava
that
we
might
afflict
ourselves
before
our
god
to
seek
of
him
a
right
way
for
us
and
for
our
little
ones
and
for
all
our
substance
for
i
was
ashamed
to
require
of
the
king
a
band
of
soldiers
and
horsemen
to
help
us
against
the
enemy
in
the
way
because
we
had
spoken
unto
the
king
saying
the
hand
of
our
god
is
upon
all
them
for
good
that
seek
him
but
his
power
and
his
wrath
is
against
all
them
that
forsake
him
so
we
fasted
and
besought
our
god
for
this
and
he
was
intreated
of
us
then
i
separated
twelve
of
the
chief
of
the
priests
sherebiah
hashabiah
and
ten
of
their
brethren
with
them
and
weighed
unto
them
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
even
the
offering
of
the
house
of
our
god
which
the
king
and
his
counsellors
and
his
lords
and
all
israel
there
present
had
offered
i
even
weighed
unto
their
hand
six
hundred
and
fifty
talents
of
silver
and
silver
vessels
an
hundred
talents
and
of
gold
an
hundred
talents
also
twenty
basons
of
gold
of
a
thousand
drams
and
two
vessels
of
fine
copper
precious
as
gold
and
i
said
unto
them
ye
are
holy
unto
the
lord
the
vessels
are
holy
also
and
the
silver
and
the
gold
are
a
freewill
offering
unto
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
watch
ye
and
keep
them
until
ye
weigh
them
before
the
chief
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
and
chief
of
the
fathers
of
israel
at
jerusalem
in
the
chambers
of
the
house
of
the
lord
so
took
the
priests
and
the
levites
the
weight
of
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
to
bring
them
to
jerusalem
unto
the
house
of
our
god
then
we
departed
from
the
river
of
ahava
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
first
month
to
go
unto
jerusalem
and
the
hand
of
our
god
was
upon
us
and
he
delivered
us
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
of
such
as
lay
in
wait
by
the
way
and
we
came
to
jerusalem
and
abode
there
three
days
now
on
the
fourth
day
was
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
weighed
in
the
house
of
our
god
by
the
hand
of
meremoth
the
son
of
uriah
the
priest
and
with
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
phinehas
and
with
them
was
jozabad
the
son
of
jeshua
and
noadiah
the
son
of
binnui
levites
by
number
and
by
weight
of
every
one
and
all
the
weight
was
written
at
that
time
also
the
children
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
which
were
come
out
of
the
captivity
offered
burnt
offerings
unto
the
god
of
israel
twelve
bullocks
for
all
israel
ninety
and
six
rams
seventy
and
seven
lambs
twelve
he
goats
for
a
sin
offering
all
this
was
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
and
they
delivered
the
king's
commissions
unto
the
king's
lieutenants
and
to
the
governors
on
this
side
the
river
and
they
furthered
the
people
and
the
house
of
god
now
when
these
things
were
done
the
princes
came
to
me
saying
the
people
of
israel
and
the
priests
and
the
levites
have
not
separated
themselves
from
the
people
of
the
lands
doing
according
to
their
abominations
even
of
the
canaanites
the
hittites
the
perizzites
the
jebusites
the
ammonites
the
moabites
the
egyptians
and
the
amorites
for
they
have
taken
of
their
daughters
for
themselves
and
for
their
sons
so
that
the
holy
seed
have
mingled
themselves
with
the
people
of
those
lands
yea
the
hand
of
the
princes
and
rulers
hath
been
chief
in
this
trespass
and
when
i
heard
this
thing
i
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle
and
plucked
off
the
hair
of
my
head
and
of
my
beard
and
sat
down
astonied
then
were
assembled
unto
me
every
one
that
trembled
at
the
words
of
the
god
of
israel
because
of
the
transgression
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
and
i
sat
astonied
until
the
evening
sacrifice
and
at
the
evening
sacrifice
i
arose
up
from
my
heaviness
and
having
rent
my
garment
and
my
mantle
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
spread
out
my
hands
unto
the
lord
my
god
and
said
o
my
god
i
am
ashamed
and
blush
to
lift
up
my
face
to
thee
my
god
for
our
iniquities
are
increased
over
our
head
and
our
trespass
is
grown
up
unto
the
heavens
since
the
days
of
our
fathers
have
we
been
in
a
great
trespass
unto
this
day
and
for
our
iniquities
have
we
our
kings
and
our
priests
been
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
the
lands
to
the
sword
to
captivity
and
to
a
spoil
and
to
confusion
of
face
as
it
is
this
day
and
now
for
a
little
space
grace
hath
been
shewed
from
the
lord
our
god
to
leave
us
a
remnant
to
escape
and
to
give
us
a
nail
in
his
holy
place
that
our
god
may
lighten
our
eyes
and
give
us
a
little
reviving
in
our
bondage
for
we
were
bondmen
yet
our
god
hath
not
forsaken
us
in
our
bondage
but
hath
extended
mercy
unto
us
in
the
sight
of
the
kings
of
persia
to
give
us
a
reviving
to
set
up
the
house
of
our
god
and
to
repair
the
desolations
thereof
and
to
give
us
a
wall
in
judah
and
in
jerusalem
and
now
o
our
god
what
shall
we
say
after
this
for
we
have
forsaken
thy
commandments
which
thou
hast
commanded
by
thy
servants
the
prophets
saying
the
land
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
it
is
an
unclean
land
with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of
the
lands
with
their
abominations
which
have
filled
it
from
one
end
to
another
with
their
uncleanness
now
therefore
give
not
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
neither
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons
nor
seek
their
peace
or
their
wealth
for
ever
that
ye
may
be
strong
and
eat
the
good
of
the
land
and
leave
it
for
an
inheritance
to
your
children
for
ever
and
after
all
that
is
come
upon
us
for
our
evil
deeds
and
for
our
great
trespass
seeing
that
thou
our
god
hast
punished
us
less
than
our
iniquities
deserve
and
hast
given
us
such
deliverance
as
this
should
we
again
break
thy
commandments
and
join
in
affinity
with
the
people
of
these
abominations
wouldest
not
thou
be
angry
with
us
till
thou
hadst
consumed
us
so
that
there
should
be
no
remnant
nor
escaping
o
lord
god
of
israel
thou
art
righteous
for
we
remain
yet
escaped
as
it
is
this
day
behold
we
are
before
thee
in
our
trespasses
for
we
cannot
stand
before
thee
because
of
this
now
when
ezra
had
prayed
and
when
he
had
confessed
weeping
and
casting
himself
down
before
the
house
of
god
there
assembled
unto
him
out
of
israel
a
very
great
congregation
of
men
and
women
and
children
for
the
people
wept
very
sore
and
shechaniah
the
son
of
jehiel
one
of
the
sons
of
elam
answered
and
said
unto
ezra
we
have
trespassed
against
our
god
and
have
taken
strange
wives
of
the
people
of
the
land
yet
now
there
is
hope
in
israel
concerning
this
thing
now
therefore
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
our
god
to
put
away
all
the
wives
and
such
as
are
born
of
them
according
to
the
counsel
of
my
lord
and
of
those
that
tremble
at
the
commandment
of
our
god
and
let
it
be
done
according
to
the
law
arise
for
this
matter
belongeth
unto
thee
we
also
will
be
with
thee
be
of
good
courage
and
do
it
then
arose
ezra
and
made
the
chief
priests
the
levites
and
all
israel
to
swear
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
word
and
they
sware
then
ezra
rose
up
from
before
the
house
of
god
and
went
into
the
chamber
of
johanan
the
son
of
eliashib
and
when
he
came
thither
he
did
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
for
he
mourned
because
of
the
transgression
of
them
that
had
been
carried
away
and
they
made
proclamation
throughout
judah
and
jerusalem
unto
all
the
children
of
the
captivity
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
unto
jerusalem
and
that
whosoever
would
not
come
within
three
days
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
princes
and
the
elders
all
his
substance
should
be
forfeited
and
himself
separated
from
the
congregation
of
those
that
had
been
carried
away
then
all
the
men
of
judah
and
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
unto
jerusalem
within
three
days
it
was
the
ninth
month
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
month
and
all
the
people
sat
in
the
street
of
the
house
of
god
trembling
because
of
this
matter
and
for
the
great
rain
and
ezra
the
priest
stood
up
and
said
unto
them
ye
have
transgressed
and
have
taken
strange
wives
to
increase
the
trespass
of
israel
now
therefore
make
confession
unto
the
lord
god
of
your
fathers
and
do
his
pleasure
and
separate
yourselves
from
the
people
of
the
land
and
from
the
strange
wives
then
all
the
congregation
answered
and
said
with
a
loud
voice
as
thou
hast
said
so
must
we
do
but
the
people
are
many
and
it
is
a
time
of
much
rain
and
we
are
not
able
to
stand
without
neither
is
this
a
work
of
one
day
or
two
for
we
are
many
that
have
transgressed
in
this
thing
let
now
our
rulers
of
all
the
congregation
stand
and
let
all
them
which
have
taken
strange
wives
in
our
cities
come
at
appointed
times
and
with
them
the
elders
of
every
city
and
the
judges
thereof
until
the
fierce
wrath
of
our
god
for
this
matter
be
turned
from
us
only
jonathan
the
son
of
asahel
and
jahaziah
the
son
of
tikvah
were
employed
about
this
matter
and
meshullam
and
shabbethai
the
levite
helped
them
and
the
children
of
the
captivity
did
so
and
ezra
the
priest
with
certain
chief
of
the
fathers
after
the
house
of
their
fathers
and
all
of
them
by
their
names
were
separated
and
sat
down
in
the
first
day
of
the
tenth
month
to
examine
the
matter
and

the
book
of

the
words
of
nehemiah
the
son
of
hachaliah
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
chisleu
in
the
twentieth
year
as
i
was
in
shushan
the
palace
that
hanani
one
of
my
brethren
came
he
and
certain
men
of
judah
and
i
asked
them
concerning
the
jews
that
had
escaped
which
were
left
of
the
captivity
and
concerning
jerusalem
and
they
said
unto
me
the
remnant
that
are
left
of
the
captivity
there
in
the
province
are
in
great
affliction
and
reproach
the
wall
of
jerusalem
also
is
broken
down
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire
and
it
came
to
pass
when
i
heard
these
words
that
i
sat
down
and
wept
and
mourned
certain
days
and
fasted
and
prayed
before
the
god
of
heaven
and
said
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
god
of
heaven
the
great
and
terrible
god
that
keepeth
covenant
and
mercy
for
them
that
love
him
and
observe
his
commandments
let
thine
ear
now
be
attentive
and
thine
eyes
open
that
thou
mayest
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
which
i
pray
before
thee
now
day
and
night
for
the
children
of
israel
thy
servants
and
confess
the
sins
of
the
children
of
israel
which
we
have
sinned
against
thee
both
i
and
my
father's
house
have
sinned
we
have
dealt
very
corruptly
against
thee
and
have
not
kept
the
commandments
nor
the
statutes
nor
the
judgments
which
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
moses
remember
i
beseech
thee
the
word
that
thou
commandedst
thy
servant
moses
saying
if
ye
transgress
i
will
scatter
you
abroad
among
the
nations
but
if
ye
turn
unto
me
and
keep
my
commandments
and
do
them
though
there
were
of
you
cast
out
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
heaven
yet
will
i
gather
them
from
thence
and
will
bring
them
unto
the
place
that
i
have
chosen
to
set
my
name
there
now
these
are
thy
servants
and
thy
people
whom
thou
hast
redeemed
by
thy
great
power
and
by
thy
strong
hand
o
lord
i
beseech
thee
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name
and
prosper
i
pray
thee
thy
servant
this
day
and
grant
him
mercy
in
the
sight
of
this
man
for
i
was
the
king's
cupbearer
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
month
nisan
in
the
twentieth
year
of
artaxerxes
the
king
that
wine
was
before
him
and
i
took
up
the
wine
and
gave
it
unto
the
king
now
i
had
not
been
beforetime
sad
in
his
presence
wherefore
the
king
said
unto
me
why
is
thy
countenance
sad
seeing
thou
art
not
sick
this
is
nothing
else
but
sorrow
of
heart
then
i
was
very
sore
afraid
and
said
unto
the
king
let
the
king
live
for
ever
why
should
not
my
countenance
be
sad
when
the
city
the
place
of
my
fathers
sepulchres
lieth
waste
and
the
gates
thereof
are
consumed
with
fire
then
the
king
said
unto
me
for
what
dost
thou
make
request
so
i
prayed
to
the
god
of
heaven
and
i
said
unto
the
king
if
it
please
the
king
and
if
thy
servant
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
that
thou
wouldest
send
me
unto
judah
unto
the
city
of
my
fathers
sepulchres
that
i
may
build
it
and
the
king
said
unto
me
the
queen
also
sitting
by
him
for
how
long
shall
thy
journey
be
and
when
wilt
thou
return
so
it
pleased
the
king
to
send
me
and
i
set
him
a
time
moreover
i
said
unto
the
king
if
it
please
the
king
let
letters
be
given
me
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river
that
they
may
convey
me
over
till
i
come
into
judah
and
a
letter
unto
asaph
the
keeper
of
the
king's
forest
that
he
may
give
me
timber
to
make
beams
for
the
gates
of
the
palace
which
appertained
to
the
house
and
for
the
wall
of
the
city
and
for
the
house
that
i
shall
enter
into
and
the
king
granted
me
according
to
the
good
hand
of
my
god
upon
me
then
i
came
to
the
governors
beyond
the
river
and
gave
them
the
king's
letters
now
the
king
had
sent
captains
of
the
army
and
horsemen
with
me
when
sanballat
the
horonite
and
tobiah
the
servant
the
ammonite
heard
of
it
it
grieved
them
exceedingly
that
there
was
come
a
man
to
seek
the
welfare
of
the
children
of
israel
so
i
came
to
jerusalem
and
was
there
three
days
and
i
arose
in
the
night
i
and
some
few
men
with
me
neither
told
i
any
man
what
my
god
had
put
in
my
heart
to
do
at
jerusalem
neither
was
there
any
beast
with
me
save
the
beast
that
i
rode
upon
and
i
went
out
by
night
by
the
gate
of
the
valley
even
before
the
dragon
well
and
to
the
dung
port
and
viewed
the
walls
of
jerusalem
which
were
broken
down
and
the
gates
thereof
were
consumed
with
fire
then
i
went
on
to
the
gate
of
the
fountain
and
to
the
king's
pool
but
there
was
no
place
for
the
beast
that
was
under
me
to
pass
then
went
i
up
in
the
night
by
the
brook
and
viewed
the
wall
and
turned
back
and
entered
by
the
gate
of
the
valley
and
so
returned
and
the
rulers
knew
not
whither
i
went
or
what
i
did
neither
had
i
as
yet
told
it
to
the
jews
nor
to
the
priests
nor
to
the
nobles
nor
to
the
rulers
nor
to
the
rest
that
did
the
work
then
said
i
unto
them
ye
see
the
distress
that
we
are
in
how
jerusalem
lieth
waste
and
the
gates
thereof
are
burned
with
fire
come
and
let
us
build
up
the
wall
of
jerusalem
that
we
be
no
more
a
reproach
then
i
told
them
of
the
hand
of
my
god
which
was
good
upon
me
as
also
the
king's
words
that
he
had
spoken
unto
me
and
they
said
let
us
rise
up
and
build
so
they
strengthened
their
hands
for
this
good
work
but
when
sanballat
the
horonite
and
tobiah
the
servant
the
ammonite
and
geshem
the
arabian
heard
it
they
laughed
us
to
scorn
and
despised
us
and
said
what
is
this
thing
that
ye
do
will
ye
rebel
against
the
king
then
answered
i
them
and
said
unto
them
the
god
of
heaven
he
will
prosper
us
therefore
we
his
servants
will
arise
and
build
but
ye
have
no
portion
nor
right
nor
memorial
in
jerusalem
then

up

and
conspired
all
of
them
together
to
come
and
to
fight
against
jerusalem
and
to
hinder
it
nevertheless
we
made
our
prayer
unto
our
god
and
set
a
watch
against
them
day
and
night
because
of
them
and
judah
said
the
strength
of
the
bearers
of
burdens
is
decayed
and
there
is
much
rubbish
so
that
we
are
not
able
to
build
the
wall
and
our
adversaries
said
they
shall
not
know
neither
see
till
we
come
in
the
midst
among
them
and
slay
them
and
cause
the
work
to
cease
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
jews
which
dwelt
by
them
came
they
said
unto
us
ten
times
from
all
places
whence
ye
shall
return
unto
us
they
will
be
upon
you
therefore
set
i
in
the
lower
places
behind
the
wall
and
on
the
higher
places
i
even
set
the
people
after
their
families
with
their
swords
their
spears
and
their
bows
and
i
looked
and
rose
up
and
said
unto
the
nobles
and
to
the
rulers
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people
be
not
ye
afraid
of
them
remember
the
lord
which
is
great
and
terrible
and
fight
for
your
brethren
your
sons
and
your
daughters
your
wives
and
your
houses
and
it
came
to
pass
when
our
enemies
heard
that
it
was
known
unto
us
and
god
had
brought
their
counsel
to
nought
that
we
returned
all
of
us
to
the
wall
every
one
unto
his
work
and
it
came
to
pass
from
that
time
forth
that
the
half
of
my
servants
wrought
in
the
work
and
the
other
half
of
them
held
both
the
spears
the
shields
and
the
bows
and
the
habergeons
and
the
rulers
were
behind
all
the
house
of
judah
they
which
builded
on
the
wall
and
they
that
bare
burdens
with
those
that
laded
every
one
with
one
of
his
hands
wrought
in
the
work
and
with
the
other
hand
held
a
weapon
for
the
builders
every
one
had
his
sword
girded
by
his
side
and
so
builded
and
he
that
sounded
the
trumpet
was
by
me
and
i
said
unto
the
nobles
and
to
the
rulers
and
to
the
rest
of
the
people
the
work
is
great
and
large
and
we
are
separated
upon
the
wall
one
far
from
another
in
what
place
therefore
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
resort
ye
thither
unto
us
our
god
shall
fight
for
us
so
we
laboured
in
the
work
and
half
of
them
held
the
spears
from
the
rising
of
the
morning
till
the
stars
appeared
likewise
at
the
same
time
said
i
unto
the
people
let
every
one
with
his
servant
lodge
within
jerusalem
that
in
the
night
they
may
be
a
guard
to
us
and
labour
on
the
day
so
neither
i
nor
my
brethren
nor
my
servants
nor
the
men
of
the
guard
which
followed
me
none
of
us
put
off
our
clothes
saving
that
every
one
put
them
off
for
washing
and
there
was
a
great
cry
of
the
people
and
of
their
wives
against
their
brethren
the
jews
for
there
were
that
said
we
our
sons
and
our
daughters
are
many
therefore
we
take
up
corn
for
them
that
we
may
eat
and
live
some
also
there
were
that
said
we
have
mortgaged
our
lands
vineyards
and
houses
that
we
might
buy
corn
because
of
the
dearth
there
were
also
that
said
we
have
borrowed
money
for
the
king's
tribute
and
that
upon
our
lands
and
vineyards
yet
now
our
flesh
is
as
the
flesh
of
our
brethren
our
children
as
their
children
and
lo
we
bring
into
bondage
our
sons
and
our
daughters
to
be
servants
and
some
of
our
daughters
are
brought
unto
bondage
already
neither
is
it
in
our
power
to
redeem
them
for
other
men
have
our
lands
and
vineyards
and
i
was
very
angry
when
i
heard
their
cry
and
these
words
then
i
consulted
with
myself
and
i
rebuked
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
said
unto
them
ye
exact
usury
every
one
of
his
brother
and
i
set
a
great
assembly
against
them
and
i
said
unto
them
we
after
our
ability
have
redeemed
our
brethren
the
jews
which
were
sold
unto
the
heathen
and
will
ye
even
sell
your
brethren
or
shall
they
be
sold
unto
us
then
held
they
their
peace
and
found
nothing
to
answer
also
i
said
it
is
not
good
that
ye
do
ought
ye
not
to
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
god
because
of
the
reproach
of
the
heathen
our
enemies
i
likewise
and
my
brethren
and
my
servants
might
exact
of
them
money
and
corn
i
pray
you
let
us
leave
off
this
usury
restore
i
pray
you
to
them
even
this
day
their
lands
their
vineyards
their
oliveyards
and
their
houses
also
the
hundredth
part
of
the
money
and
of
the
corn
the
wine
and
the
oil
that
ye
exact
of
them
then
said
they
we
will
restore
them
and
will
require
nothing
of
them
so
will
we
do
as
thou
sayest
then
i
called
the
priests
and
took
an
oath
of
them
that
they
should
do
according
to
this
promise
also
i
shook
my
lap
and
said
so
god
shake
out
every
man
from
his
house
and
from
his
labour
that
performeth
not
this
promise
even
thus
be
he
shaken
out
and
emptied
and
all
the
congregation
said
amen
and
praised
the
lord
and
the
people
did
according
to
this
promise
moreover
from
the
time
that
i
was
appointed
to
be
their
governor
in
the
land
of
judah
from
the
twentieth
year
even
unto
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
the
king
that
is
twelve
years
i
and
my
brethren
have
not
eaten
the
bread
of
the
governor
but
the
former
governors
that
had
been
before
me
were
chargeable
unto
the
people
and
had
taken
of
them
bread
and
wine
beside
forty
shekels
of
silver
yea
even
their
servants
bare
rule
over
the
people
but
so
did
not
i
because
of
the
fear
of
god
yea
also
i
continued
in
the
work
of
this
wall
neither
bought
we
any
land
and
all
my
servants
were
gathered
thither
unto
the
work
moreover
there
were
at
my
table
an
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
jews
and
rulers
beside
those
that
came
unto
us
from
among
the
heathen
that
are
about
us
now
that
which
was
prepared
for
me
daily
was
one
ox
and
six
choice
sheep
also
fowls
were
prepared
for
me
and
once
in
ten
days
store
of
all
sorts
of
wine
yet
for
all
this
required
not
i
the
bread
of
the
governor
because
the
bondage
was
heavy
upon
this
people
think
upon
me
my
god
for
good
according
to
all
that
i
have
done
for
this
people
now
it
came
to
pass
when
sanballat
and
tobiah
and
geshem
the
arabian
and
the
rest
of
our
enemies
heard
that
i
had
builded
the
wall
and
that
there
was
no
breach
left
therein
though
at
that
time
i
had
not
set
up
the
doors
upon
the
gates
that
sanballat
and
geshem
sent
unto
me
saying
come
let
us
meet
together
in
some
one
of
the
villages
in
the
plain
of
ono
but
they
thought
to
do
me
mischief
and
i
sent
messengers
unto
them
saying
i
am
doing
a
great
work
so
that
i
cannot
come
down
why
should
the
work
cease
whilst
i
leave
it
and
come
down
to
you
yet
they
sent
unto
me
four
times
after
this
sort
and
i
answered
them
after
the
same
manner
then
sent
sanballat
his
servant
unto
me
in
like
manner
the
fifth
time
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
wherein
was
written
it
is
reported
among
the
heathen
and
gashmu
saith
it
that
thou
and
the
jews
think
to
rebel
for
which
cause
thou
buildest
the
wall
that
thou
mayest
be
their
king
according
to
these
words
and
thou
hast
also
appointed
prophets
to
preach
of
thee
at
jerusalem
saying
there
is
a
king
in
judah
and
now
shall
it
be
reported
to
the
king
according
to
these
words
come
now
therefore
and
let
us
take
counsel
together
then
i
sent
unto
him
saying
there
are
no
such
things
done
as
thou
sayest
but
thou
feignest
them
out
of
thine
own
heart
for
they
all
made
us
afraid
saying
their
hands
shall
be
weakened
from
the
work
that
it
be
not
done
now
therefore
o
god
strengthen
my
hands
afterward
i
came
unto
the
house
of
shemaiah
the
son
of
delaiah
the
son
of
mehetabeel
who
was
shut
up
and
he
said
let
us
meet
together
in
the
house
of
god
within
the
temple
and
let
us
shut
the
doors
of
the
temple
for
they
will
come
to
slay
thee
yea
in
the
night
will
they
come
to
slay
thee
and
i
said
should
such
a
man
as
i
flee
and
who
is
there
that
being
as
i
am
would
go
into
the
temple
to
save
his
life
i
will
not
go
in
and
lo
i
perceived
that
god
had
not
sent
him
but
that
he
pronounced
this
prophecy
against
me
for
tobiah
and
sanballat
had
hired
him
therefore
was
he
hired
that
i
should
be
afraid
and
do
so
and
sin
and
that
they
might
have
matter
for
an
evil
report
that
they
might
reproach
me
my
god
think
thou
upon
tobiah
and
sanballat
according
to
these
their
works
and
on
the
prophetess
noadiah
and
the
rest
of
the
prophets
that
would
have
put
me
in
fear
so
the
wall
was
finished
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
day
of
the
month
elul
in
fifty
and
two
days
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
all
our
enemies
heard
thereof
and
all
the
heathen
that
were
about
us
saw
these
things
they
were
much
cast
down
in
their
own
eyes
for
they
perceived
that
this
work
was
wrought
of
our
god
moreover
in
those
days
the
nobles
of
judah
sent
many
letters
unto
tobiah
and
the
letters
of
tobiah
came
unto
them
for
there
were
many
in
judah
sworn
unto
him
because
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
shechaniah
the
son
of
arah
and
his
son
johanan
had
taken
the
daughter
of
meshullam
the
son
of
berechiah
also
they
reported
his
good
deeds
before
me
and
uttered
my
words
to
him
and
tobiah
sent
letters
to
put
me
in
fear
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
wall
was
built
and
i
had
set
up
the
doors
and
the
porters
and
the
singers
and
the
levites
were
appointed
that
i
gave
my
brother
hanani
and
hananiah
the
ruler
of
the
palace
charge
over
jerusalem
for
he
was
a
faithful
man
and
feared
god
above
many
and
i
said
unto
them
let
not
the
gates
of
jerusalem
be
opened
until
the
sun
be
hot
and
while
they
stand
by
let
them
shut
the
doors
and
bar
them
and
appoint
watches
of
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
every
one
in
his
watch
and
every
one
to
be
over
against
his
house
now
the
city
was
large
and
great
but
the
people
were
few
therein
and
the
houses
were
not
builded
and
my
god
put
into
mine
heart
to
gather
together
the
nobles
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
that
they
might
be
reckoned
by
genealogy
and
i
found
a
register
of
the
genealogy
of
them
which
came
up
at
the
first
and
found
written
therein
these
are
the
children
of
the
province
that
went
up
out
of
the
captivity
of
those

had
been
carried
away
whom
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
and
came
again

so
they
read
in

book
in
the
law
of
god
distinctly
and
gave
the
sense
and
caused
them
to
understand
the

and
nehemiah
which

and
ezra
the

said
unto
all
the
people
this
day
is
holy
unto
the
lord
your
god
mourn
not
nor
weep
for
all
the
people
wept
when
they
heard
the
words
of
the
law
then
he
said
unto
them
go
your
way
eat
the
fat
and
drink
the

and
send

unto

for
whom
nothing

this
day
is

unto
our
lord
neither
be
ye
sorry
for
the
joy
of

so
the
levites
stilled
all
the
people
saying
hold
your
peace
for
the
day
is
holy
neither
be
ye
grieved
and
all
the
people
went
their
way
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
send
portions
and
to
make
great
mirth
because
they
had
understood
the
words
that
were
declared
unto
them
and
on
the

day
were
gathered
together
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
all
the
people
the
priests
and
the
levites
unto
ezra
the
scribe
even
to
understand
the
words
of
the
law
and
they
found
written
in
the
law
which
the
lord
had
commanded
by
moses
that
the
children
of
israel
should
dwell
in
booths
in
the
feast
of

seventh
month
and
that
they
should
publish
and
proclaim
in
all
their
cities
and
in

saying
go
forth
unto
the
mount
and
fetch
olive
branches
and
pine
branches
and
myrtle
branches
and
palm
branches
and
branches
of
thick
trees
to
make
booths
as
it
is
written

the
people
went
forth
and
brought
them
and
made
themselves
booths
every
one
upon
the
roof
of
his
house
and
in
their
courts
and
in

courts
of
the
house
of

and
in

the
gate
of
ephraim
and
all
the
congregation
of
them
that

come
again
out
of
the
captivity
made
booths
and
sat
under
the
booths
for
since
the
days
of
jeshua
the
son
of
nun
unto
that
day
had
not
the
children
of
israel
done
so
and
there
was
very
great
gladness
also
day
by
day
from
the
first
day
unto
the
last
day

read
in
the
book
of

eighth
day
was
a
solemn
assembly
according
unto
the
manner
now
in
the
twenty
and
fourth
day
of
this
month
the
children
of
israel
were
assembled
with
fasting
and
with
sackclothes
and
earth
upon
them
and
the
seed
of
israel
separated
themselves
from
all
strangers
and
stood
and
confessed
their
sins
and
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
and
they
stood
up
in
their
place
and
read
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
the
lord
their
god
one
fourth
part
of
the
day
and
another
fourth
part
they
confessed
and
worshipped
the

and
bani
kadmiel
shebaniah
bunni
sherebiah
bani
and
chenani

and
kadmiel
bani

sherebiah
hodijah
shebaniah
and

said
stand
up
and
bless
the
lord
your
god
for
ever
and
ever
and
blessed
be
thy
glorious
name
which
is
exalted
above
all
blessing
and
praise
thou
even
thou
art
lord
alone
thou
hast
made
heaven
the
heaven
of
heavens
with
all
their
host
the
earth
and
all
things
that
are
therein
the
seas
and
all
that
is
therein
and
thou
preservest
them
all
and
the
host
of
heaven
worshippeth
thee
thou
art
the
lord
the
god
who
didst
choose
abram
and
broughtest
him
forth
out
of
ur
of
the
chaldees
and
gavest
him
the
name
of
abraham
and
foundest
his
heart
faithful
before
thee
and
madest
a
covenant
with
him
to
give
the
land
of
the
canaanites
the
hittites
the
amorites
and
the
perizzites
and
the
jebusites
and
the
girgashites
to
give
it
i
say
to
his
seed
and
hast
performed
thy
words
for
thou
art
righteous
and
didst
see
the
affliction
of
our
fathers
in
egypt
and
heardest
their
cry
by
the
red
sea
and
shewedst
signs
and
wonders
upon
pharaoh
and
on
all
his
servants
and
on
all
the
people
of
his
land
for
thou
knewest
that
they
dealt
proudly
against
them
so
didst
thou
get
thee
a
name
as
it
is
this
day
and
thou
didst
divide
the
sea
before
them
so
that
they
went
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
on
the
dry
land
and
their
persecutors
thou
threwest
into
the
deeps
as
a
stone
into
the
mighty
waters
moreover
thou
leddest
them
in
the
day
by
a
cloudy
pillar
and
in
the
night
by
a
pillar
of
fire
to
give
them
light
in
the
way
wherein
they
should
go
thou
camest
down
also
upon
mount
sinai
and
spakest
with
them
from
heaven
and
gavest
them
right
judgments
and
true
laws
good
statutes
and
commandments
and
madest
known
unto
them
thy
holy
sabbath
and
commandedst
them
precepts
statutes
and
laws
by
the
hand
of
moses
thy
servant
and
gavest
them
bread
from
heaven
for
their
hunger
and
broughtest
forth
water
for
them
out
of
the
rock
for
their
thirst
and
promisedst
them
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
the
land
which
thou
hadst
sworn
to
give
them
but
they
and
our
fathers
dealt
proudly
and
hardened
their
necks
and
hearkened
not
to
thy
commandments
and
refused
to
obey
neither
were
mindful
of
thy
wonders
that
thou
didst
among
them
but
hardened
their
necks
and
in
their
rebellion
appointed
a
captain
to
return
to
their
bondage
but
thou
art
a
god
ready
to
pardon
gracious
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
kindness
and
forsookest
them
not
yea
when
they
had
made
them
a
molten
calf
and
said
this
is
thy
god
that
brought
thee
up
out
of
egypt
and
had
wrought
great
provocations
yet
thou
in
thy
manifold
mercies
forsookest
them
not
in
the
wilderness
the
pillar
of
the
cloud
departed
not
from
them
by
day
to
lead
them
in
the
way
neither
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
to
shew
them
light
and
the
way
wherein
they
should
go
thou
gavest
also
thy
good
spirit
to
instruct
them
and
withheldest
not
thy
manna
from
their
mouth
and
gavest
them
water
for
their
thirst
yea
forty
years
didst
thou
sustain
them
in
the
wilderness
so
that
they
lacked
nothing
their
clothes
waxed
not
old
and
their
feet
swelled
not
moreover
thou
gavest
them
kingdoms
and
nations
and
didst
divide
them
into
corners
so
they
possessed
the
land
of
sihon
and
the
land
of
the
king
of
heshbon
and
the
land
of
og
king
of
bashan
their
children
also
multipliedst
thou
as
the
stars
of
heaven
and
broughtest
them
into
the
land
concerning
which
thou
hadst
promised
to
their
fathers
that
they
should
go
in
to
possess
it
so
the
children
went
in
and
possessed
the
land
and
thou
subduedst
before
them
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
the
canaanites
and
gavest
them
into
their
hands
with
their
kings
and
the
people
of
the
land
that
they
might
do
with
them
as
they
would
and
they
took
strong
cities
and
a
fat
land
and
possessed
houses
full
of
all
goods
wells
digged
vineyards
and
oliveyards
and
fruit
trees
in
abundance
so
they
did
eat
and
were
filled
and
became
fat
and
delighted
themselves
in
thy
great
goodness
nevertheless
they
were
disobedient
and
rebelled
against
thee
and
cast
thy
law
behind
their
backs
and
slew
thy
prophets
which
testified
against
them
to
turn
them
to
thee
and
they
wrought
great
provocations
therefore
thou
deliveredst
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
who
vexed
them
and
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
when
they
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
them
from
heaven
and
according
to
thy
manifold
mercies
thou
gavest
them
saviours
who
saved
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
but
after
they
had
rest
they
did
evil
again
before
thee
therefore
leftest
thou
them
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
so
that
they
had
the
dominion
over
them
yet
when
they
returned
and
cried
unto
thee
thou
heardest
them
from
heaven
and
many
times
didst
thou
deliver
them
according
to
thy
mercies
and
testifiedst
against
them
that
thou
mightest
bring
them
again
unto
thy
law
yet
they
dealt
proudly
and
hearkened
not
unto
thy
commandments
but
sinned
against
thy
judgments
which
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
and
withdrew
the
shoulder
and
hardened
their
neck
and
would
not
hear
yet
many
years
didst
thou
forbear
them
and
testifiedst
against
them
by
thy
spirit
in
thy
prophets
yet
would
they
not
give
ear
therefore
gavest
thou
them
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
the
lands
nevertheless
for
thy
great
mercies
sake
thou
didst
not
utterly
consume
them
nor
forsake
them
for
thou
art
a
gracious
and
merciful
god
now
therefore
our
god
the
great
the
mighty
and
the
terrible
god
who
keepest
covenant
and
mercy
let
not
all
the
trouble
seem
little
before
thee
that
hath
come
upon
us
on
our
kings
on
our
princes
and
on
our
priests
and
on
our
prophets
and
on
our
fathers
and
on
all
thy
people
since
the
time
of
the
kings
of
assyria
unto
this
day
howbeit
thou
art
just
in
all
that
is
brought
upon
us
for
thou
hast
done
right
but
we
have
done
wickedly
neither
have
our
kings
our
princes
our
priests
nor
our
fathers
kept
thy
law
nor
hearkened
unto
thy
commandments
and
thy
testimonies
wherewith
thou
didst
testify
against
them
for
they
have
not
served
thee
in
their
kingdom
and
in
thy
great
goodness
that
thou
gavest
them
and
in
the
large
and
fat
land
which
thou
gavest
before
them
neither
turned
they
from
their
wicked
works
behold
we
are
servants
this
day
and
for
the
land
that
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
to
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
good
thereof
behold
we
are
servants
in
it
and
it
yieldeth
much
increase
unto
the
kings
whom
thou
hast
set
over
us
because
of
our
sins
also
they
have
dominion
over
our
bodies
and
over
our
cattle
at
their
pleasure
and
we
are
in
great
distress
and
because
of
all
this
we
make
a
sure
covenant
and
write
it
and

there

of

songs
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
unto
god
and
all
israel
in
the
days
of

and
in

gave
the
portions
of
the
singers
and
the

every
day
his
portion
and
they
sanctified
holy
things
unto
the
levites
and
the
levites
sanctified
them
unto
the
children
of
aaron
on
that
day
they
read
in
the
book
of
moses
in
the
audience
of
the
people
and
therein
was
found
written
that
the
ammonite
and
the
moabite
should
not
come
into
the
congregation
of
god
for
ever
because
they
met
not
the
children
of
israel
with
bread
and
with
water
but
hired
balaam
against
them
that
he
should
curse
them
howbeit
our
god
turned
the
curse
into
a
blessing
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
heard
the
law
that
they
separated
from
israel
all
the
mixed
multitude
and
before
this
eliashib
the
priest
having
the
oversight
of
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
our
god
was
allied
unto
tobiah
and
he
had
prepared
for
him
a
great
chamber
where
aforetime
they
laid
the
meat
offerings
the
frankincense
and
the
vessels
and
the
tithes
of
the
corn
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
which
was
commanded
to
be
given
to
the
levites
and
the
singers
and
the
porters
and
the
offerings
of
the
priests
but
in
all
this
time
was
not
i
at
jerusalem
for
in
the
two
and
thirtieth
year
of
artaxerxes
king
of
babylon
came
i
unto
the
king
and
after
certain
days
obtained
i
leave
of
the
king
and
i
came
to
jerusalem
and
understood
of
the
evil
that
eliashib
did
for
tobiah
in
preparing
him
a
chamber
in
the
courts
of
the
house
of
god
and
it
grieved
me
sore
therefore
i
cast
forth
all
the
household
stuff
to
tobiah
out
of
the
chamber
then
i
commanded
and
they
cleansed
the
chambers
and
thither
brought
i
again
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
god
with
the
meat
offering
and
the
frankincense
and
i
perceived
that
the
portions
of
the
levites
had
not
been
given
them
for
the
levites
and
the
singers
that
did
the
work
were
fled
every
one
to
his
field
then
contended
i
with
the
rulers
and
said
why
is
the
house
of
god
forsaken
and
i
gathered
them
together
and
set
them
in
their
place
then
brought
all
judah
the
tithe
of
the
corn
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
unto
the
treasuries
and
i
made
treasurers
over
the
treasuries
shelemiah
the
priest
and
zadok
the
scribe
and
of
the
levites
pedaiah
and
next
to
them
was
hanan
the
son
of
zaccur
the
son
of
mattaniah
for
they
were
counted
faithful
and
their
office
was
to
distribute
unto
their
brethren
remember
me
o
my
god
concerning
this
and
wipe
not
out
my
good
deeds
that
i
have
done
for
the
house
of
my
god
and
for
the
offices
thereof
in
those
days
saw
i
in
judah
some
treading
wine
presses
on
the
sabbath
and
bringing
in
sheaves
and
lading
asses
as
also
wine
grapes
and
figs
and
all
manner
of
burdens
which
they
brought
into
jerusalem
on
the
sabbath
day
and
i
testified
against
them
in
the
day
wherein
they
sold
victuals
there
dwelt
men
of
tyre
also
therein
which
brought
fish
and
all
manner
of
ware
and
sold
on
the
sabbath
unto
the
children
of
judah
and
in
jerusalem
then
i
contended
with
the
nobles
of
judah
and
said
unto
them
what
evil
thing
is
this
that
ye
do
and
profane
the
sabbath
day
did
not
your
fathers
thus
and
did
not
our
god
bring
all
this
evil
upon
us
and
upon
this
city
yet
ye
bring
more
wrath
upon
israel
by
profaning
the
sabbath
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
gates
of
jerusalem
began
to
be
dark
before
the
sabbath
i
commanded
that
the
gates
should
be
shut
and
charged
that
they
should
not
be
opened
till
after
the
sabbath
and
some
of
my
servants
set
i
at
the
gates
that
there
should
no
burden
be
brought
in
on
the
sabbath
day
so
the
merchants
and
sellers
of
all
kind
of
ware
lodged
without
jerusalem
once
or
twice
then
i
testified
against
them
and
said
unto
them
why
lodge
ye
about
the
wall
if
ye
do
so
again
i
will
lay
hands
on
you
from
that
time
forth
came
they
no
more
on
the
sabbath
and
i
commanded
the
levites
that
they
should
cleanse
themselves
and
that
they
should
come
and
keep
the
gates
to
sanctify
the
sabbath
day
remember
me
o
my
god
concerning
this
also
and
spare
me
according
to
the
greatness
of
thy
mercy
in
those
days
also
saw
i
jews
that
had
married
wives
of
ashdod
of
ammon
and
of
moab
and
their
children
spake
half
in
the
speech
of
ashdod
and
could
not
speak
in
the
jews
language
but
according
to
the
language
of
each
people
and
i
contended
with
them
and
cursed
them
and
smote
certain
of
them
and
plucked
off
their
hair
and
made
them
swear
by
god
saying
ye
shall
not
give
your
daughters
unto
their
sons
nor
take
their
daughters
unto
your
sons
or
for
yourselves
did
not
solomon
king
of
israel
sin
by
these
things
yet
among
many
nations
was
there
no
king
like
him
who
was
beloved
of
his
god
and
god
made
him
king
over
all
israel
nevertheless
even
him
did
outlandish
women
cause
to
sin
shall
we
then
hearken
unto
you
to
do
all
this
great
evil
to
transgress
against
our
god
in
marrying
strange
wives
and
one
of
the
sons
of
joiada
the
son
of
eliashib
the
high
priest
was
son
in
law
to
sanballat
the
horonite
therefore
i
chased
him
from
me
remember
them
o
my
god
because
they
have
defiled
the
priesthood
and
the
covenant
of
the
priesthood
and
of
the
levites
thus
cleansed
i
them
from
all
strangers
and
appointed
the
wards
of
the
priests
and
the
levites
every
one
in
his
business
and
for
the
wood
offering
at
times
appointed

the

had
appointed
to

that
they
should

made
a
feast
for

in
the
royal

which
belonged
to

on
the
seventh

he
commanded
mehuman
biztha
harbona
bigtha
and
abagtha
zethar
and
carcas
the
seven
chamberlains
that
served
in
the
presence
of

bring
vashti
the
queen
before
the
king
with
the
crown
royal
to
shew
the
people
and
the
princes
her
beauty
for
she
was
fair
to
look
on
but
the
queen
vashti
refused
to
come
at
the
king's
commandment
by
his
chamberlains
therefore
was
the
king
very
wroth
and
his
anger
burned
in
him
then
the
king
said
to
the
wise
men
which
knew
the
times
for
so
was
the
king's
manner
toward
all
that
knew
law
and
judgment
and
the
next
unto
him
was
carshena
shethar
admatha
tarshish
meres
marsena
and
memucan
the
seven
princes
of
persia
and
media
which
saw
the
king's
face
and
which
sat
the
first
in
the
kingdom
what
shall
we
do
unto
the
queen
vashti
according
to
law
because
she
hath
not
performed
the
commandment
of
the
king
ahasuerus
by
the
chamberlains
and
memucan
answered
before
the
king
and
the
princes
vashti
the
queen
hath
not
done
wrong
to
the
king
only
but
also
to
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
that
are
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
for
this
deed
of
the
queen
shall
come
abroad
unto
all
women
so
that
they
shall
despise
their
husbands
in
their
eyes
when
it
shall
be
reported
the
king
ahasuerus
commanded
vashti
the
queen
to
be
brought
in
before
him
but
she
came
not
likewise
shall
the
ladies
of
persia
and
media
say
this
day
unto
all
the
king's
princes
which
have
heard
of
the
deed
of
the
queen
thus
shall
there
arise
too
much
contempt
and
wrath
if
it
please
the
king
let
there
go
a
royal
commandment
from
him
and
let
it
be
written
among
the
laws
of
the
persians
and
the
medes
that
it
be
not
altered
that
vashti
come
no
more
before
king
ahasuerus
and
let
the
king
give
her
royal
estate
unto
another
that
is
better
than
she
and
when
the
king's
decree
which
he
shall
make
shall
be
published
throughout
all
his
empire
for
it
is
great
all
the
wives
shall
give
to
their
husbands
honour
both
to
great
and
small
and
the
saying
pleased
the
king
and
the
princes
and
the
king
did
according
to
the
word
of
memucan
for
he
sent
letters
into
all
the
king's
provinces
into
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof
and
to
every
people
after
their
language
that
every
man
should
bear
rule
in
his
own
house
and
that
it
should
be
published
according
to
the
language
of
every
people
after
these
things
when
the
wrath
of
king
ahasuerus
was
appeased
he
remembered
vashti
and
what
she
had
done
and
what
was
decreed
against
her
then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministered
unto
him
let
there
be
fair
young
virgins
sought
for
the
king
and
let
the
king
appoint
officers
in
all
the
provinces
of
his
kingdom
that
they
may
gather
together
all
the
fair
young
virgins
unto
shushan
the
palace
to
the
house
of
the
women
unto
the
custody
of
hege
the
king's
chamberlain
keeper
of
the
women
and
let
their
things
for
purification
be
given
them
and
let
the
maiden
which
pleaseth
the
king
be
queen
instead
of
vashti
and
the
thing
pleased
the
king
and
he
did
so
now
in
shushan
the
palace
there
was
a
certain
jew
whose
name
was
mordecai
the
son
of
jair
the
son
of
shimei
the
son
of
kish
a
benjamite
who
had
been
carried
away
from
jerusalem
with
the
captivity
which
had
been
carried
away
with
jeconiah
king
of
judah
whom
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
babylon
had
carried
away
and
he
brought
up
hadassah
that
is
esther
his
uncle's
daughter
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
the
maid
was
fair
and
beautiful
whom
mordecai
when
her
father
and
mother
were
dead
took
for
his
own
daughter
so
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
was
heard
and
when
many
maidens
were
gathered
together
unto
shushan
the
palace
to
the
custody
of
hegai
that
esther
was
brought
also
unto
the
king's
house
to
the
custody
of
hegai
keeper
of
the
women
and
the
maiden
pleased
him
and
she
obtained
kindness
of
him
and
he
speedily
gave
her
her
things
for
purification
with
such
things
as
belonged
to
her
and
seven
maidens
which
were
meet
to
be
given
her
out
of
the
king's
house
and
he
preferred
her
and
her
maids
unto
the
best
place
of
the
house
of
the
women
esther
had
not
shewed
her
people
nor
her
kindred
for
mordecai
had
charged
her
that
she
should
not
shew
it
and
mordecai
walked
every
day
before
the
court
of
the
women's
house
to
know
how
esther
did
and
what
should
become
of
her
now
when
every
maid's
turn
was
come
to
go
in
to
king
ahasuerus
after
that
she
had
been
twelve
months
according
to
the
manner
of
the
women
for
so
were
the
days
of
their
purifications
accomplished
to
wit
six
months
with
oil
of
myrrh
and
six
months
with
sweet
odours
and
with
other
things
for
the
purifying
of
the
women
then
thus
came
every
maiden
unto
the
king
whatsoever
she
desired
was
given
her
to
go
with
her
out
of
the
house
of
the
women
unto
the
king's
house
in
the
evening
she
went
and
on
the
morrow
she
returned
into
the
second
house
of
the
women
to
the
custody
of
shaashgaz
the
king's
chamberlain
which
kept
the
concubines
she
came
in
unto
the
king
no
more
except
the
king
delighted
in
her
and
that
she
were
called
by
name
now
when
the
turn
of
esther
the
daughter
of
abihail
the
uncle
of
mordecai
who
had
taken
her
for
his
daughter
was
come
to
go
in
unto
the
king
she
required
nothing
but
what
hegai
the
king's
chamberlain
the
keeper
of
the
women
appointed
and
esther
obtained
favour
in
the
sight
of
all
them
that
looked
upon
her
so
esther
was
taken
unto
king
ahasuerus
into
his
house
royal
in
the
tenth
month
which
is
the
month
tebeth
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
reign
and
the
king
loved
esther
above
all
the
women
and
she
obtained
grace
and
favour
in
his
sight
more
than
all
the
virgins
so
that
he
set
the
royal
crown
upon
her
head
and
made
her
queen
instead
of
vashti
then
the
king
made
a
great
feast
unto
all
his
princes
and
his
servants
even
esther's
feast
and
he
made
a
release
to
the
provinces
and
gave
gifts
according
to
the
state
of
the
king
and
when
the
virgins
were
gathered
together
the
second
time
then
mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
gate
esther
had
not
yet
shewed
her
kindred
nor
her
people
as
mordecai
had
charged
her
for
esther
did
the
commandment
of
mordecai
like
as
when
she
was
brought
up
with
him
in
those
days
while
mordecai
sat
in
the
king's
gate
two
of
the
king's
chamberlains
bigthan
and
teresh
of
those
which
kept
the
door
were
wroth
and
sought
to
lay
hands
on
the
king
ahasuerus
and
the
thing
was
known
to
mordecai
who
told
it
unto
esther
the
queen
and
esther
certified
the
king
thereof
in
mordecai's
name
and
when
inquisition
was
made
of
the
matter
it
was
found
out
therefore
they
were
both
hanged
on
a
tree
and
it
was
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
before
the
king
after
these
things
did
king
ahasuerus
promote
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
and
advanced
him
and
set
his
seat
above
all
the
princes
that
were
with
him
and
all
the
king's
servants
that
were
in
the
king's
gate
bowed
and
reverenced
haman
for
the
king
had
so
commanded
concerning
him
but
mordecai
bowed
not
nor
did
him
reverence
then
the
king's
servants
which
were
in
the
king's
gate
said
unto
mordecai
why
transgressest
thou
the
king's
commandment
now
it
came
to
pass
when
they
spake
daily
unto
him
and
he
hearkened
not
unto
them
that
they
told
haman
to
see
whether
mordecai's
matters
would
stand
for
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
jew
and
when
haman
saw
that
mordecai
bowed
not
nor
did
him
reverence
then
was
haman
full
of
wrath
and
he
thought
scorn
to
lay
hands
on
mordecai
alone
for
they
had
shewed
him
the
people
of
mordecai
wherefore
haman
sought
to
destroy
all
the
jews
that
were
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
ahasuerus
even
the
people
of
mordecai
in
the
first
month
that
is
the
month
nisan
in
the
twelfth
year
of
king
ahasuerus
they
cast
pur
that
is
the
lot
before
haman
from
day
to
day
and
from
month
to
month
to
the
twelfth
month
that
is
the
month
adar
and
haman
said
unto
king
ahasuerus
there
is
a
certain
people
scattered
abroad
and
dispersed
among
the
people
in
all
the
provinces
of
thy
kingdom
and
their
laws
are
diverse
from
all
people
neither
keep
they
the
king's
laws
therefore
it
is
not
for
the
king's
profit
to
suffer
them
if
it
please
the
king
let
it
be
written
that
they
may
be
destroyed
and
i
will
pay
ten
thousand
talents
of
silver
to
the
hands
of
those
that
have
the
charge
of
the
business
to
bring
it
into
the
king's
treasuries
and
the
king
took
his
ring
from
his
hand
and
gave
it
unto
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
the
jews
enemy
and
the
king
said
unto
haman
the
silver
is
given
to
thee
the
people
also
to
do
with
them
as
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
then
were
the
king's
scribes
called
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
there
was
written
according
to
all
that
haman
had
commanded
unto
the
king's
lieutenants
and
to
the
governors
that
were
over
every
province
and
to
the
rulers
of
every
people
of
every
province
according
to
the
writing
thereof
and
to
every
people
after
their
language
in
the
name
of
king
ahasuerus
was
it
written
and
sealed
with
the
king's
ring
and
the
letters
were
sent
by
posts
into
all
the
king's
provinces
to
destroy
to
kill
and
to
cause
to
perish
all
jews
both
young
and
old
little
children
and
women
in
one
day
even
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
month
which
is
the
month
adar
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
prey
the
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
people
that
they
should
be
ready
against
that
day
the
posts
went
out
being
hastened
by
the
king's
commandment
and
the
decree
was
given
in
shushan
the
palace
and
the
king
and
haman
sat
down
to
drink
but
the
city
shushan
was
perplexed
when
mordecai
perceived
all
that
was
done
mordecai
rent
his
clothes
and
put
on
sackcloth
with
ashes
and
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
city
and
cried
with
a
loud
and
a
bitter
cry
and
came
even
before
the
king's
gate
for
none
might
enter
into
the
king's
gate
clothed
with
sackcloth
and

whithersoever
the

there
was
great
mourning
among

and
wailing
and
many
lay
in
sackcloth
and

so
esther's
maids
and
her
chamberlains
came
and
told
it
her
then
was
the
queen
exceedingly
grieved
and
she
sent
raiment
to
clothe
mordecai
and
to
take
away
his
sackcloth
from
him
but
he
received
it
not
then
called
esther
for
hatach
one
of
the
king's
chamberlains
whom
he
had
appointed
to
attend
upon
her
and
gave
him
a
commandment
to

was
and
why
it
was
so
hatach
went
forth
to
mordecai
unto
the
street
of
the
city
which
was
before
the
king's

and
mordecai
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
unto
him
and
of
the
sum
of
the
money
that
haman
had
promised
to
pay
to
the
king's
treasuries
for
the
jews
to
destroy
them
also
he
gave
him
the
copy
of
the
writing
of
the
decree
that
was
given
at
shushan
to
destroy
them
to
shew
it
unto
esther
and
to
declare
it
unto
her
and
to
charge
her
that
she
should
go
in
unto
the
king
to
make
supplication
unto
him
and
to
make
request
before
him
for

people
and
hatach
came
and
told
esther
the
words
of
mordecai
again
esther
spake
unto
hatach
and
gave
him
commandment
unto
mordecai
all
the
king's
servants
and
the
people
of
the
king's
provinces
do
know
that
whosoever
whether
man
or
women
shall
come
unto
the
king
into
the
inner
court
who
is
not
called
there
is
one
law
of
his
to
put
him
to
death
except
such
to
whom
the
king
shall
hold
out
the
golden
sceptre
that
he
may
live
but
i
have
not
been
called
to
come
in
unto
the
king
these
thirty
days
and
they
told
to
mordecai
esther's
words
then
mordecai
commanded
to
answer
esther
think
not
with
thyself
that
thou
shalt
escape
in
the
king's
house
more
than
all
the
jews
for
if
thou
altogether
holdest
thy
peace
at
this
time
then
shall
there
enlargement
and
deliverance
arise
to
the
jews
from
another
place
but
thou
and
thy
father's
house
shall
be
destroyed
and
who
knoweth
whether
thou
art
come
to
the
kingdom
for
such
a
time
as
this
then
esther
bade
them
return
mordecai
this
answer
go
gather
together
all
the
jews
that
are
present
in
shushan
and
fast
ye
for
me
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
three
days
night
or

i
also
and
my
maidens
will
fast
likewise
and
so
will
i
go
in
unto
the
king
which
is
not
according
to
the
law
and
if
i
perish
i
perish
so
mordecai
went
his
way
and
did
according
to
all
that
esther
had
commanded
him
now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
third
day
that
esther
put
on
her
royal
apparel
and
stood
in
the
inner
court
of
the
king's
house
over
against
the
king's
house
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
royal
throne
in
the
royal
house
over
against
the
gate
of
the
house
and
it
was
so
when
the
king
saw
esther
the
queen
standing
in
the
court
that
she
obtained
favour
in
his
sight
and
the
king
held
out
to
esther
the
golden
sceptre
that
was
in
his
hand
so
esther
drew
near
and
touched
the
top
of
the
sceptre
then
said
the
king
unto
her
what
wilt
thou
queen
esther
and
what
is
thy
request
it
shall
be
even
given
thee
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
and
esther
answered
if

seem
good
unto
the
king
let
the
king
and
haman
come
this
day
unto
the
banquet
that
i
have
prepared
for
him
then
the
king
said
cause
haman
to
make
haste
that
he
may
do
as
esther
hath
said
so
the
king
and
haman
came
to
the
banquet
that
esther
had
prepared
and
the
king
said
unto
esther
at
the
banquet
of
wine
what

petition
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee
and
what
is
thy
request
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
it
shall
be
performed
then
answered
esther
and
said
my
petition
and
my
request
is
if
i
have
found
favour
in
the
sight
of
the
king
and
if
it
please
the
king
to
grant
my
petition
and
to

my
request
let
the
king
and
haman
come
to
the
banquet
that
i
shall
prepare
for
them
and
i
will
do
to
morrow
as
the
king
hath
said
then
went
haman
forth
that
day
joyful
and
with
a
glad
heart
but
when
haman
saw
mordecai
in
the
king's
gate
that
he
stood
not
up
nor
moved
for
him
he
was
full
of
indignation
against
mordecai
nevertheless
haman
refrained
himself
and
when
he
came
home
he
sent
and
called
for
his
friends
and
zeresh
his
wife
and
haman
told
them
of
the
glory
of
his
riches
and
the
multitude
of
his
children
and
all
the
things
wherein
the
king
had
promoted
him
and
how
he
had
advanced
him
above
the
princes
and
servants
of
the
king
haman
said
moreover
yea
esther
the
queen
did
let
no
man
come
in
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
that
she
had
prepared
but
myself
and
to
morrow
am
i
invited
unto
her
also
with
the
king
yet
all
this
availeth
me
nothing
so
long
as
i
see
mordecai
the
jew
sitting
at
the
king's
gate
then
said
zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
unto
him
let
a
gallows
be
made
of
fifty
cubits
high
and
to
morrow
speak
thou
unto
the
king
that
mordecai
may
be
hanged
thereon
then
go
thou
in
merrily
with
the
king
unto
the
banquet
and
the
thing
pleased
haman
and
he
caused
the
gallows
to
be
made
on
that
night
could
not
the
king
sleep
and
he
commanded
to
bring
the
book
of
records
of
the
chronicles
and
they
were
read
before
the
king
and
it
was
found
written
that
mordecai
had
told
of
bigthana
and
teresh
two
of
the
king's
chamberlains
the
keepers
of
the
door
who
sought
to
lay
hand
on
the
king
ahasuerus
and
the
king
said
what
honour
and
dignity
hath
been
done
to
mordecai
for
this
then
said
the
king's
servants
that
ministered
unto
him
there
is
nothing
done
for
him
and
the
king
said
who
is
in
the
court
now
haman
was
come
into
the
outward
court
of
the
king's
house
to
speak
unto
the
king
to
hang
mordecai
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
him
and
the
king's
servants
said
unto
him
behold
haman
standeth
in
the
court
and
the
king
said
let
him
come
in
so
haman
came
in
and
the
king
said
unto
him
what
shall
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
now
haman
thought
in
his
heart
to
whom
would
the
king
delight
to
do
honour
more
than
to
myself
and
haman
answered
the
king
for
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
let
the
royal
apparel
be
brought
which
the
king
useth
to
wear
and
the
horse
that
the
king
rideth
upon
and
the
crown
royal
which
is
set
upon
his
head
and
let
this
apparel
and
horse
be
delivered
to
the
hand
of
one
of
the
king's
most
noble
princes
that
they
may
array
the
man
withal
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
and
bring
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city
and
proclaim
before
him
thus
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
then
the
king
said
to
haman
make
haste
and
take
the
apparel
and
the
horse
as
thou
hast
said
and
do
even
so
to
mordecai
the
jew
that
sitteth
at
the
king's
gate
let
nothing
fail
of
all
that
thou
hast
spoken
then
took
haman
the
apparel
and
the
horse
and
arrayed
mordecai
and
brought
him
on
horseback
through
the
street
of
the
city
and
proclaimed
before
him
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
the
man
whom
the
king
delighteth
to
honour
and
mordecai
came
again
to
the
king's
gate
but
haman
hasted
to
his
house
mourning
and
having
his
head
covered
and
haman
told
zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
every
thing
that
had
befallen
him
then
said
his
wise
men
and
zeresh
his
wife
unto
him
if
mordecai
be
of
the
seed
of
the
jews
before
whom
thou
hast
begun
to
fall
thou
shalt
not
prevail
against
him
but
shalt
surely
fall
before
him
and
while
they
were
yet
talking
with
him
came
the
king's
chamberlains
and
hasted
to
bring
haman
unto
the
banquet
that
esther
had
prepared
so
the
king
and
haman
came
to
banquet
with
esther
the
queen
and
the
king
said
again
unto
esther
on
the
second
day
at
the
banquet
of
wine
what
is
thy
petition
queen
esther
and
it
shall
be
granted
thee
and
what
is
thy
request
and
it
shall
be
performed
even
to
the
half
of
the
kingdom
then
esther
the
queen
answered
and
said
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thy
sight
o
king
and
if
it
please
the
king
let
my
life
be
given
me
at
my
petition
and
my
people
at
my
request
for
we
are
sold
i
and
my
people
to
be
destroyed
to
be
slain
and
to
perish
but
if
we
had
been
sold
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
i
had
held
my
tongue
although
the
enemy
could
not
countervail
the
king's
damage
then
the
king
ahasuerus
answered
and
said
unto
esther
the
queen
who
is
he
and
where
is
he
that
durst
presume
in
his
heart
to
do
so
and
esther
said
the
adversary
and
enemy
is
this
wicked
haman
then
haman
was
afraid
before
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
king
arising
from
the
banquet
of
wine
in
his
wrath
went
into
the
palace
garden
and
haman
stood
up
to
make
request
for
his
life
to
esther
the
queen
for
he
saw
that
there
was
evil
determined
against
him
by
the
king
then
the
king
returned
out
of
the
palace
garden
into
the
place
of
the
banquet
of
wine
and
haman
was
fallen
upon
the
bed
whereon
esther
was
then
said
the
king
will
he
force
the
queen
also
before
me
in
the
house
as
the
word
went
out
of
king's
mouth
they
covered
haman's
face
and
harbonah
one
of
the
chamberlains
said
before
the
king
behold
also
the
gallows
fifty
cubits
high
which
haman
had
made
for
mordecai
who
spoken
good
for
the
king
standeth
in
the
house
of
haman
then
the
king
said
hang
him
thereon
so
they
hanged
haman
on
the
gallows
that
he
had
prepared
for
mordecai
then
was
the
king's
wrath
pacified
on
that
day
did
the
king
ahasuerus
give
the
house
of
haman
the
jews
enemy
unto
esther
the
queen
and
mordecai
came
before
the
king
for
esther
had
told
what
he
was
unto
her
and
the
king
took
off
his
ring
which
he
had
taken
from
haman
and
gave
it
unto
mordecai
and
esther
set
mordecai
over
the
house
of
haman
and
esther
spake
yet
again
before
the
king
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
besought
him
with
tears
to
put
away
the
mischief
of
haman
the
agagite
and
his
device
that
he
had
devised
against
the
jews
then
the
king
held
out
the
golden
sceptre
toward
esther
so
esther
arose
and
stood
before
the
king
and
said
if
it
please
the
king
and
if
i
have
favour
in
his
sight
and
the
thing
seem
right
before
the
king
and
i
be
pleasing
in
his
eyes
let
it
be
written
to
reverse
the
letters
devised
by
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
which
he
wrote
to
destroy
the
jews
which
are
in
all
the
king's
provinces
for
how
can
i
endure
to
see
the
evil
that
shall
come
unto
my
people
or
how
can
i
endure
to
see
the
destruction
of
my
kindred
then
the
king
ahasuerus
said
unto
esther
the
queen
and
to
mordecai
the
jew
behold
i
have
given
esther
the
house
of
haman
and
him
they
have
hanged
upon
the
gallows
because
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
jews
write
ye
also
for
the
jews
as
it
liketh
you
in
the
king's
name
and
seal
it
with
the
king's

for
the
writing
which
is
written
in
the
king's
name
and
sealed
with
the
king's
ring
may
no

then
were
the
king's
scribes
called
at
that
time
in
the
third
month
that
is
the
month
sivan
on
the
three

thereof
and
it
was
written
according
to
all
that
mordecai
commanded
unto
the

and
to

and
unto

and
to

according
to

and
according

and
he
wrote
in
the
king
ahasuerus
name
and
sealed
it
with
the
king's
ring
and
sent
letters
by
posts
on
horseback
and
riders
on
mules
camels
and
young
dromedaries
wherein
the
king
granted
the
jews
which
were
in
every
city
to
gather
themselves
together
and
to
stand
for
their
life
to
destroy
to
slay
and
to
cause
to
perish
all
the
power
of
the
people
and
province
that
would
assault
them
both
little
ones
and
women
and
to
take
the
spoil
of
them
for
a
prey
upon
one
day
in
all
the
provinces
of
king
ahasuerus
namely
upon
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
twelfth
month
which
is
the
month
adar
the
copy
of
the
writing
for
a
commandment
to
be
given
in
every
province
was
published
unto
all
people
and
that
the
jews
should
be
ready
against
that
day
to
avenge
themselves
on
their
enemies
so
the
posts
that
rode
upon
mules
and
camels
went
out
being
hastened
and
pressed
on
by
the
king's
commandment
and
the
decree
was
given
at
shushan
the
palace
and
mordecai
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king
in
royal
apparel
of
blue
and
white
and
with
a
great
crown
of
gold
and
with
a
garment
of
fine
linen
and
purple
and
the
city
of
shushan
rejoiced
and
was
glad
the
jews
had
light
and
gladness
and
joy
and
honour
and
in
every
province
and
in
every
city
whithersoever
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
came
the
jews
had
joy
and
gladness
a
feast
and
a
good
day
and
many
of
the
people
of
the
land
became
jews
for
the
fear
of
the
jews
fell
upon
them
now
in
the
twelfth
month
that
is
the
month
adar
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
same
when
the
king's
commandment
and
his
decree
drew
near
to
be
put
in
execution
in
the
day
that
the
enemies
of
the
jews
hoped
to
have
power
over
them
though
it
was
turned
to
the
contrary
that
the
jews
had
rule
over
them
that
hated
them
the
jews
gathered
themselves
together
in
their
cities
throughout
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
to
lay
hand
on
such
as
sought
their
hurt
and
no
man
could
withstand
them
for
the
fear
of
them
fell
upon
all
people
and
all
the
rulers
of
the
provinces
and
the
lieutenants
and
the
deputies
and
officers
of
the
king
helped
the
jews
because
the
fear
of
mordecai
fell
upon
them
for
mordecai
was
great
in
the
king's
house
and
his
fame
went
out
throughout
all
the
provinces
for
this
man
mordecai
waxed
greater
and
greater
thus
the
jews
smote
all
their
enemies
with
the
stroke
of
the
sword
and
slaughter
and
destruction
and
did
what
they
would
unto
those
that
hated
them
and
in

let

and
let

and
the

commanded
it
so
to
be
done
and
the
decree
was
given
at

and
they
hanged
haman's
ten
sons
for
the
jews
that
were
in
shushan
gathered
themselves
together
on
the
fourteenth
day
also
of
the
month
adar
and
slew
three
hundred
men
at
shushan
but
on
the
prey
they
laid
not
their
hand
but
the
other
jews
that
were
in
the
king's
provinces
gathered
themselves
together
and
stood
for
their
lives
and
had
rest
from
their
enemies
and
slew
of
their
foes
seventy
and
five
thousand
but
they
laid
not
their
hands
on
the
prey
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
rested
they
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness
but
the
jews
that
were
at
shushan
assembled
together
on
the
thirteenth
day
thereof
and
on
the
fourteenth
thereof
and
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
they
rested
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
gladness
therefore
the
jews
of
the
villages
that
dwelt
in
the
unwalled
towns
made
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
a
day
of
gladness
and
feasting
and
a
good
day
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another
and
mordecai
wrote
these
things
and
sent
letters
unto
all
the
jews
that
were
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
king
ahasuerus
both
nigh
and
far
to
stablish
this
among
them
that
they
should
keep
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
adar
and
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
yearly
as
the
days
wherein
the
jews
rested
from
their
enemies
and
the
month
which
was
turned
unto
them
from
sorrow
to
joy
and
from
mourning
into
a
good
day
that
they
should
make
them
days
of
feasting
and
joy
and
of
sending
portions
one
to
another
and
gifts
to
the
poor
and
the
jews
undertook
to
do
as
they
had
begun
and
as
mordecai
had
written
unto
them
because
haman
the
son
of
hammedatha
the
agagite
the
enemy
of
all
the
jews
had
devised
against
the
jews
to
destroy
them
and
had
cast
pur
that
is
the
lot
to
consume
them
and
to
destroy
them
but
when
esther
came
before
the
king
he
commanded
by
letters
that
his
wicked
device
which
he
devised
against
the
jews
should
return
upon
his
own
head
and
that
he
and
his
sons
should
be
hanged
on
the
gallows
wherefore
they
called
these
days
purim
after
the
name
of
pur
therefore
for
all
the
words
of
this
letter
and
of
that
which
they
had
seen
concerning
this
matter
and
which
had
come
unto
them
the
jews
ordained
and
took
upon
them
and
upon
their
seed
and
upon
all
such
as
joined
themselves
unto
them
so
as
it
should
not
fail
that
they
would
keep
these
two
days
according
to
their
writing
and
according
to
their
appointed
time
every
year
and
that
these
days
should
be
remembered
and
kept
throughout
every
generation
every
family
every
province
and
every
city
and
that
these
days
of
purim
should
not
fail
from
among
the
jews
nor
the
memorial
of
them
perish
from
their
seed
then
esther
the
queen
the
daughter
of
abihail
and
mordecai
the
jew
wrote
with
all
authority
to
confirm
this
second
letter
of
purim
and
he
sent
the
letters
unto
all
the
jews
to
the
hundred
twenty
and
seven
provinces
of
the
kingdom
of
ahasuerus
with
words
of
peace
and
truth
to
confirm
these
days
of
purim
in
their
times
appointed
according
as
mordecai
the
jew
and
esther
the
queen
had
enjoined
them
and
as
they
had
decreed
for
themselves
and
for
their
seed
the
matters
of
the
fastings
and
their
cry
and
the
decree
of
esther
confirmed
these
matters
of
purim
and
it
was
written
in
the
book
and
the
king
ahasuerus
laid
a
tribute
upon
the
land
and
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
all
the
acts
of
his
power
and
of
his
might
and
the
declaration
of
the
greatness
of
mordecai
whereunto
the
king
advanced
him
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
media
and
persia
for
mordecai
the
jew
was
next
unto
king
ahasuerus
and
great
among
the
jews
and
accepted
of
the
multitude
of
his
brethren
seeking
the
wealth
of
his
people
and
speaking
peace
to
all
his
seed
the
book
of
job
there
was
a
man
in
the
land
of
uz
whose
name
was
job
and
that
man
was
perfect
and
upright
and
one
that
feared
god
and
eschewed
evil
and
there
were
born
unto
him
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
his
substance
also
was
seven
thousand
sheep
and
three
thousand
camels
and
five
hundred
yoke
of
oxen
and
five
hundred
she
asses
and
a
very
great
household
so
that
this
man
was
the
greatest
of
all
the
men
of
the
east
and
his
sons
went
and
feasted
in
their
houses
every
one
his
day
and
sent
and
called
for
their
three
sisters
to
eat
and
to
drink
with
them
and
it
was
so
when
the
days
of
their
feasting
were
gone
about
that
job
sent
and
sanctified
them
and
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
offered
burnt
offerings
according
to
the
number
of
them
all
for
job
said
it
may
be
that
my
sons
have
sinned
and
cursed
god
in
their
hearts
thus
did
job
continually
now
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
god
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
lord
and
satan
came
also
among
them
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
whence
comest
thou
then
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man
one
that
feareth
god
and
escheweth
evil
then
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
doth
job
fear
god
for
nought
hast
not
thou
made
an
hedge
about
him
and
about
his
house
and
about
all
that
he
hath
on
every
side
thou
hast
blessed
the
work
of
his
hands
and
his
substance
is
increased
in
the
land
but
put
forth
thine
hand
now
and
touch
all
that
he
hath
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
behold
all
that
he
hath
is
in
thy
power
only
upon
himself
put
not
forth
thine
hand
so
satan
went
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
there
was
a
day
when
his
sons
and
his
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother's
house
and
there
came
a
messenger
unto
job
and
said
the
oxen
were
plowing
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them
and
the
sabeans
fell
upon
them
and
took
them
away
yea
they
have
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
fire
of
god
is
fallen
from
heaven
and
hath
burned
up
the
sheep
and
the
servants
and
consumed
them
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
the
chaldeans
made
out
three
bands
and
fell
upon
the
camels
and
have
carried
them
away
yea
and
slain
the
servants
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
while
he
was
yet
speaking
there
came
also
another
and
said
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
eldest
brother's
house
and
behold
there
came
a
great
wind
from
the
wilderness
and
smote
the
four
corners
of
the
house
and
it
fell
upon
the
young
men
and
they
are
dead
and
i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
then
job
arose
and
rent
his
mantle
and
shaved
his
head
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
worshipped
and
said
naked
came
i
out
of
my
mother's
womb
and
naked
shall
i
return
thither
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
in
all
this
job
sinned
not
nor
charged
god
foolishly
again
there
was
a
day
when
the
sons
of
god
came
to
present
themselves
before
the
lord
and
satan
came
also
among
them
to
present
himself
before
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
from
whence
comest
thou
and
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
that
there
is
none
like
him
in
the
earth
a
perfect
and
an
upright
man
one
that
feareth
god
and
escheweth
evil
and
still
he
holdeth
fast
his
integrity
although
thou
movedst
me
against
him
to
destroy
him
without
cause
and
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
skin
for
skin
yea
all
that
a
man
hath
will
he
give
for
his
life
but
put
forth
thine
hand
now
and
touch
his
bone
and
his
flesh
and
he
will
curse
thee
to
thy
face
and
the
lord
said
unto
satan
behold
he
is
in
thine
hand
but
save
his
life
so
went
satan
forth
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
smote
job
with
sore
boils
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
unto
his
crown
and
he
took
him
a
potsherd
to
scrape
himself
withal
and
he
sat
down
among
the
ashes
then
said
his
wife
unto
him
dost
thou
still
retain
thine
integrity
curse
god
and
die
but
he
said
unto
her
thou
speakest
as
one
of
the
foolish
women
speaketh
what
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
god
and
shall
we
not
receive
evil
in
all
this
did
not
job
sin
with
his
lips
now
when
job's
three
friends
heard
of
all
this
evil
that
was
come
upon
him
they
came
every
one
from
his
own
place
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
bildad
the
shuhite
and
zophar
the
naamathite
for
they
had
made
an
appointment
together
to
come
to
mourn
with
him
and
to
comfort
him
and
when
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
afar
off
and
knew
him
not
they
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
they
rent
every
one
his
mantle
and
sprinkled
dust
upon
their
heads
toward
heaven
so
they
sat
down
with
him
upon
the
ground
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
none
spake
a
word
unto
him
for
they
saw
that
his
grief
was
very
great
after
this
opened
job
his
mouth
and
cursed
his
day
and
job
spake
and
said
let
the
day
perish
wherein
i
was
born
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
said
there
is
a
man
child
conceived
let
that
day
be
darkness
let
not
god
regard
it
from
above
neither
let
the
light
shine
upon
it
let
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
stain
it
let
a
cloud
dwell
upon
it
let
the
blackness
of
the
day
terrify
it
as
for
that
night
let
darkness
seize
upon
it
let
it
not
be
joined
unto
the
days
of
the
year
let
it
not
come
into
the
number
of
the
months
lo
let
that
night
be
solitary
let
no
joyful
voice
come
therein
let
them
curse
it
that
curse
the
day
who
are
ready
to
raise
up
their
mourning
let
the
stars
of
the
twilight
thereof
be
dark
let
it
look
for
light
but
have
none
neither
let
it
see
the
dawning
of
the
day
because
it
shut
not
up
the
doors
of
my
mother's
womb
nor
hid
sorrow
from
mine
eyes
why
died
i
not
from
the
womb
why
did
i
not
give
up
the
ghost
when
i
came
out
of
the
belly
why
did
the
knees
prevent
me
or
why
the
breasts
that
i
should
suck
for
now
should
i
have
lain
still
and
been
quiet
i
should
have
slept
then
had
i
been
at
rest
with
kings
and
counsellors
of
the
earth
which
build
desolate
places
for
themselves
or
with
princes
that
had
gold
who
filled
their
houses
with
silver
or
as
an
hidden
untimely
birth
i
had
not
been
as
infants
which
never
saw
light
there
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest
there
the
prisoners
rest
together
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor
the
small
and
great
are
there
and
the
servant
is
free
from
his
master
wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
misery
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
soul
which
long
for
death
but
it
cometh
not
and
dig
for
it
more
than
for
hid
treasures
which
rejoice
exceedingly
and
are
glad
when
they
can
find
the
grave
why
is
light
given
to
a
man
whose
way
is
hid
and
whom
god
hath
hedged
in
for
my
sighing
cometh
before
i
eat
and
my
roarings
are
poured
out
like
the
waters
for
the
thing
which
i
greatly
feared
is
come
upon
me
and
that
which
i
was
afraid
of
is
come
unto
me
i
was
not
in
safety
neither
had
i
rest
neither
was
i
quiet
yet
trouble
came
then
eliphaz
the
temanite
answered
and
said
if
we
assay
to
commune
with
thee
wilt
thou
be
grieved
but
who
can
withhold
himself
from
speaking
behold
thou
hast
instructed
many
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
weak
hands
thy
words
have
upholden
him
that
was
falling
and
thou
hast
strengthened
the
feeble
knees
but
now
it
is
come
upon
thee
and
thou
faintest
it
toucheth
thee
and
thou
art
troubled
is
not
this
thy
fear
thy
confidence
thy
hope
and
the
uprightness
of
thy
ways
remember
i
pray
thee
who
ever
perished
being
innocent
or
where
were
the
righteous
cut
off
even
as
i
have
seen
they
that
plow
iniquity
and
sow
wickedness
reap
the
same
by
the
blast
of
god
they
perish
and
by
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
are
they
consumed
the
roaring
of
the
lion
and
the
voice
of
the
fierce
lion
and
the
teeth
of
the
young
lions
are
broken
the
old
lion
perisheth
for
lack
of
prey
and
the
stout
lion's
whelps
are
scattered
abroad
now
a
thing
was
secretly
brought
to
me
and
mine
ear
received
a
little
thereof
in
thoughts
from
the
visions
of
the
night
when
deep
sleep
falleth
on
men
fear
came
upon
me
and
trembling
which
made
all
my
bones
to
shake
then
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up
it
stood
still
but
i
could
not
discern
the
form
thereof
an
image
was
before
mine
eyes
there
was
silence
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than
god
shall
a
man
be
more
pure
than
his
maker
behold
he
put
no
trust
in
his
servants
and
his
angels
he
charged
with
folly
how
much
less
in
them
that
dwell
in
houses
of
clay
whose
foundation
is
in
the
dust
which
are
crushed
before
the
moth
they
are
destroyed
from
morning
to
evening
they
perish
for
ever
without
any
regarding
it
doth
not
their
excellency
which
is
in
them
go
away
they
die
even
without
wisdom
call
now
if
there
be
any
that
will
answer
thee
and
to
which
of
the
saints
wilt
thou
turn
for
wrath
killeth
the
foolish
man
and
envy
slayeth
the
silly
one
i
have
seen
the
foolish
taking
root
but
suddenly
i
cursed
his
habitation
his
children
are
far
from
safety
and
they
are
crushed
in
the
gate
neither
is
there
any
to
deliver
them
whose
harvest
the
hungry
eateth
up
and
taketh
it
even
out
of
the
thorns
and
the
robber
swalloweth
up
their
substance
although
affliction
cometh
not
forth
of
the
dust
neither
doth
trouble
spring
out
of
the
ground
yet
man
is
born
unto
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
i
would
seek
unto
god
and
unto
god
would
i
commit
my
cause
which
doeth
great
things
and
unsearchable
marvellous
things
without
number
who
giveth
rain
upon
the
earth
and
sendeth
waters
upon
the
fields
to
set
up
on
high
those
that
be
low
that
those
which
mourn
may
be
exalted
to
safety
he
disappointeth
the
devices
of
the
crafty
so
that
their
hands
cannot
perform
their
enterprise
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
and
the
counsel
of
the
froward
is
carried
headlong
they
meet
with
darkness
in
the
day
time
and
grope
in
the
noonday
as
in
the
night
but
he
saveth
the
poor
from
the
sword
from
their
mouth
and
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty
so
the
poor
hath
hope
and
iniquity
stoppeth
her
mouth
behold
happy
is
the
man
whom
god
correcteth
therefore
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
almighty
for
he
maketh
sore
and
bindeth
up
he
woundeth
and
his
hands
make
whole
he
shall
deliver
thee
in
six
troubles
yea
in
seven
there
shall
no
evil
touch
thee
in
famine
he
shall
redeem
thee
from
death
and
in
war
from
the
power
of
the
sword
thou
shalt
be
hid
from
the
scourge
of
the
tongue
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
destruction
when
it
cometh
at
destruction
and
famine
thou
shalt
laugh
neither
shalt
thou
be
afraid
of
the
beasts
of
the
earth
for
thou
shalt
be
in
league
with
the
stones
of
the
field
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
at
peace
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
tabernacle
shall
be
in
peace
and
thou
shalt
visit
thy
habitation
and
shalt
not
sin
thou
shalt
know
also
that
thy
seed
shall
be
great
and
thine
offspring
as
the
grass
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
come
to
thy
grave
in
a
full
age
like
as
a
shock
of
corn
cometh
in
in
his
season
lo
this
we
have
searched
it
so
it
is
hear
it
and
know
thou
it
for
thy
good
but
job
answered
and
said
oh
that
my
grief
were
throughly
weighed
and
my
calamity
laid
in
the
balances
together
for
now
it
would
be
heavier
than
the
sand
of
the
sea
therefore
my
words
are
swallowed
up
for
the
arrows
of
the
almighty
are
within
me
the
poison
whereof
drinketh
up
my
spirit
the
terrors
of
god
do
set
themselves
in
array
against
me
doth
the
wild
ass
bray
when
he
hath
grass
or
loweth
the
ox
over
his
fodder
can
that
which
is
unsavoury
be
eaten
without
salt
or
is
there
any
taste
in
the
white
of
an
egg
the
things
that
my
soul
refused
to
touch
are
as
my
sorrowful
meat
oh
that
i
might
have
my
request
and
that
god
would
grant
me
the
thing
that
i
long
for
even
that
it
would
please
god
to
destroy
me
that
he
would
let
loose
his
hand
and
cut
me
off
then
should
i
yet
have
comfort
yea
i
would
harden
myself
in
sorrow
let
him
not
spare
for
i
have
not
concealed
the
words
of
the
holy
one
what
is
my
strength
that
i
should
hope
and
what
is
mine
end
that
i
should
prolong
my
life
is
my
strength
the
strength
of
stones
or
is
my
flesh
of
brass
is
not
my
help
in
me
and
is
wisdom
driven
quite
from
me
to
him
that
is
afflicted
pity
should
be
shewed
from
his
friend
but
he
forsaketh
the
fear
of
the
almighty
my
brethren
have
dealt
deceitfully
as
a
brook
and
as
the
stream
of
brooks
they
pass
away
which
are
blackish
by
reason
of
the
ice
and
wherein
the
snow
is
hid
what
time
they
wax
warm
they
vanish
when
it
is
hot
they
are
consumed
out
of
their
place
the
paths
of
their
way
are
turned
aside
they
go
to
nothing
and
perish
the
troops
of
tema
looked
the
companies
of
sheba
waited
for
them
they
were
confounded
because
they
had
hoped
they
came
thither
and
were
ashamed
for
now
ye
are
nothing
ye
see
my
casting
down
and
are
afraid
did
i
say
bring
unto
me
or
give
a
reward
for
me
of
your
substance
or
deliver
me
from
the
enemy's
hand
or
redeem
me
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty
teach
me
and
i
will
hold
my
tongue
and
cause
me
to
understand
wherein
i
have
erred
how
forcible
are
right
words
but
what
doth
your
arguing
reprove
do
ye
imagine
to
reprove
words
and
the
speeches
of
one
that
is
desperate
which
are
as
wind
yea
ye
overwhelm
the
fatherless
and
ye
dig
a
pit
for
your
friend
now
therefore
be
content
look
upon
me
for
it
is
evident
unto
you
if
i
lie
return
i
pray
you
let
it
not
be
iniquity
yea
return
again
my
righteousness
is
in
it
is
there
iniquity
in
my
tongue
cannot
my
taste
discern
perverse
things
is
there
not
an
appointed
time
to
man
upon
earth
are
not
his
days
also
like
the
days
of
an
hireling
as
a
servant
earnestly
desireth
the
shadow
and
as
an
hireling
looketh
for
the
reward
of
his
work
so
am
i
made
to
possess
months
of
vanity
and
wearisome
nights
are
appointed
to
me
when
i
lie
down
i
say
when
shall
i
arise
and
the
night
be
gone
and
i
am
full
of
tossings
to
and
fro
unto
the
dawning
of
the
day
my
flesh
is
clothed
with
worms
and
clods
of
dust
my
skin
is
broken
and
become
loathsome
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
weaver's
shuttle
and
are
spent
without
hope
o
remember
that
my
life
is
wind
mine
eye
shall
no
more
see
good
the
eye
of
him
that
hath
seen
me
shall
see
me
no
more
thine
eyes
are
upon
me
and
i
am
not
as
the
cloud
is
consumed
and
vanisheth
away
so
he
that
goeth
down
to
the
grave
shall
come
up
no
more
he
shall
return
no
more
to
his
house
neither
shall
his
place
know
him
any
more
therefore
i
will
not
refrain
my
mouth
i
will
speak
in
the
anguish
of
my
spirit
i
will
complain
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
am
i
a
sea
or
a
whale
that
thou
settest
a
watch
over
me
when
i
say
my
bed
shall
comfort
me
my
couch
shall
ease
my
complaints
then
thou
scarest
me
with
dreams
and
terrifiest
me
through
visions
so
that
my
soul
chooseth
strangling
and
death
rather
than
my
life
i
loathe
it
i
would
not
live
alway
let
me
alone
for
my
days
are
vanity
what
is
man
that
thou
shouldest
magnify
him
and
that
thou
shouldest
set
thine
heart
upon
him
and
that
thou
shouldest
visit
him
every
morning
and
try
him
every
moment
how
long
wilt
thou
not
depart
from
me
nor
let
me
alone
till
i
swallow
down
my
spittle
i
have
sinned
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
o
thou
preserver
of
men
why
hast
thou
set
me
as
a
mark
against
thee
so
that
i
am
a
burden
to
myself
and
why
dost
thou
not
pardon
my
transgression
and
take
away
my
iniquity
for
now
shall
i
sleep
in
the
dust
and
thou
shalt
seek
me
in
the
morning
but
i
shall
not
be
then
answered
bildad
the
shuhite
and
said
how
long
wilt
thou
speak
these
things
and
how
long
shall
the
words
of
thy
mouth
be
like
a
strong
wind
doth
god
pervert
judgment
or
doth
the
almighty
pervert
justice
if
thy
children
have
sinned
against
him
and
he
have
cast
them
away
for
their
transgression
if
thou
wouldest
seek
unto
god
betimes
and
make
thy
supplication
to
the
almighty
if
thou
wert
pure
and
upright
surely
now
he
would
awake
for
thee
and
make
the
habitation
of
thy
righteousness
prosperous
though
thy
beginning
was
small
yet
thy
latter
end
should
greatly
increase
for
enquire
i
pray
thee
of
the
former
age
and
prepare
thyself
to
the
search
of
their
fathers
for
we
are
but
of
yesterday
and
know
nothing
because
our
days
upon
earth
are
a
shadow
shall
not
they
teach
thee
and
tell
thee
and
utter
words
out
of
their
heart
can
the
rush
grow
up
without
mire
can
the
flag
grow
without
water
whilst
it
is
yet
in
his
greenness
and
not
cut
down
it
withereth
before
any
other
herb
so
are
the
paths
of
all
that
forget
god
and
the
hypocrite's
hope
shall
perish
whose
hope
shall
be
cut
off
and
whose
trust
shall
be
a
spider's
web
he
shall
lean
upon
his
house
but
it
shall
not
stand
he
shall
hold
it
fast
but
it
shall
not
endure
he
is
green
before
the
sun
and
his
branch
shooteth
forth
in
his
garden
his
roots
are
wrapped
about
the
heap
and
seeth
the
place
of
stones
if
he
destroy
him
from
his
place
then
it
shall
deny
him
saying
i
have
not
seen
thee
behold
this
is
the
joy
of
his
way
and
out
of
the
earth
shall
others
grow
behold
god
will
not
cast
away
a
perfect
man
neither
will
he
help
the
evil
doers
till
he
fill
thy
mouth
with
laughing
and
thy
lips
with
rejoicing
they
that
hate
thee
shall
be
clothed
with
shame
and
the
dwelling
place
of
the
wicked
shall
come
to
nought
then
job
answered
and
said
i
know
it
is
so
of
a
truth
but
how
should
man
be
just
with
god
if
he
will
contend
with
him
he
cannot
answer
him
one
of
a
thousand
he
is
wise
in
heart
and
mighty
in
strength
who
hath
hardened
himself
against
him
and
hath
prospered
which
removeth
the
mountains
and
they
know
not
which
overturneth
them
in
his
anger
which
shaketh
the
earth
out
of
her
place
and
the
pillars
thereof
tremble
which
commandeth
the
sun
and
it
riseth
not
and
sealeth
up
the
stars
which
alone
spreadeth
out
the
heavens
and
treadeth
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea
which
maketh
arcturus
orion
and
pleiades
and
the
chambers
of
the
south
which
doeth
great
things
past
finding
out
yea
and
wonders
without
number
lo
he
goeth
by
me
and
i
see
him
not
he
passeth
on
also
but
i
perceive
him
not
behold
he
taketh
away
who
can
hinder
him
who
will
say
unto
him
what
doest
thou
if
god
will
not
withdraw
his
anger
the
proud
helpers
do
stoop
under
him
how
much
less
shall
i
answer
him
and
choose
out
my
words
to
reason
with
him
whom
though
i
were
righteous
yet
would
i
not
answer
but
i
would
make
supplication
to
my
judge
if
i
had
called
and
he
had
answered
me
yet
would
i
not
believe
that
he
had
hearkened
unto
my
voice
for
he
breaketh
me
with
a
tempest
and
multiplieth
my
wounds
without
cause
he
will
not
suffer
me
to
take
my
breath
but
filleth
me
with
bitterness
if
i
speak
of
strength
lo
he
is
strong
and
if
of
judgment
who
shall
set
me
a
time
to
plead
if
i
justify
myself
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
me
if
i
say
i
am
perfect
it
shall
also
prove
me
perverse
though
i
were
perfect
yet
would
i
not
know
my
soul
i
would
despise
my
life
this
is
one
thing
therefore
i
said
it
he
destroyeth
the
perfect
and
the
wicked
if
the
scourge
slay
suddenly
he
will
laugh
at
the
trial
of
the
innocent
the
earth
is
given
into
the
hand
of
the
wicked
he
covereth
the
faces
of
the
judges
thereof
if
not
where
and
who
is
he
now
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
post
they
flee
away
they
see
no
good
they
are
passed
away
as
the
swift
ships
as
the
eagle
that
hasteth
to
the
prey
if
i
say
i
will
forget
my
complaint
i
will
leave
off
my
heaviness
and
comfort
myself
i
am
afraid
of
all
my
sorrows
i
know
that
thou
wilt
not
hold
me
innocent
if
i
be
wicked
why
then
labour
i
in
vain
if
i
wash
myself
with
snow
water
and
make
my
hands
never
so
clean
yet
shalt
thou
plunge
me
in
the
ditch
and
mine
own
clothes
shall
abhor
me
for
he
is
not
a
man
as
i
am
that
i
should
answer
him
and
we
should
come
together
in
judgment
neither
is
there
any
daysman
betwixt
us
that
might
lay
his
hand
upon
us
both
let
him
take
his
rod
away
from
me
and
let
not
his
fear
terrify
me
then
would
i
speak
and
not
fear
him
but
it
is
not
so
with
me
my
soul
is
weary
of
my
life
i
will
leave
my
complaint
upon
myself
i
will
speak
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
i
will
say
unto
god
do
not
condemn
me
shew
me
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
me
is
it
good
unto
thee
that
thou
shouldest
oppress
that
thou
shouldest
despise
the
work
of
thine
hands
and
shine
upon
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
hast
thou
eyes
of
flesh
or
seest
thou
as
man
seeth
are
thy
days
as
the
days
of
man
are
thy
years
as
man's
days
that
thou
enquirest
after
mine
iniquity
and
searchest
after
my
sin
thou
knowest
that
i
am
not
wicked
and
there
is
none
that
can
deliver
out
of
thine
hand
thine
hands
have
made
me
and
fashioned
me
together
round
about
yet
thou
dost
destroy
me
remember
i
beseech
thee
that
thou
hast
made
me
as
the
clay
and
wilt
thou
bring
me
into
dust
again
hast
thou
not
poured
me
out
as
milk
and
curdled
me
like
cheese
thou
hast
clothed
me
with
skin
and
flesh
and
hast
fenced
me
with
bones
and
sinews
thou
hast
granted
me
life
and
favour
and
thy
visitation
hath
preserved
my
spirit
and
these
things
hast
thou
hid
in
thine
heart
i
know
that
this
is
with
thee
if
i
sin
then
thou
markest
me
and
thou
wilt
not
acquit
me
from
mine
iniquity
if
i
be
wicked
woe
unto
me
and
if
i
be
righteous
yet
will
i
not
lift
up
my
head
i
am
full
of
confusion
therefore
see
thou
mine
affliction
for
it
increaseth
thou
huntest
me
as
a
fierce
lion
and
again
thou
shewest
thyself
marvellous
upon
me
thou
renewest
thy
witnesses
against
me
and
increasest
thine
indignation
upon
me
changes
and
war
are
against
me
wherefore
then
hast
thou
brought
me
forth
out
of
the
womb
oh
that
i
had
given
up
the
ghost
and
no
eye
had
seen
me
i
should
have
been
as
though
i
had
not
been
i
should
have
been
carried
from
the
womb
to
the
grave
are
not
my
days
few
cease
then
and
let
me
alone
that
i
may
take
comfort
a
little
before
i
go
whence
i
shall
not
return
even
to
the
land
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
a
land
of
darkness
as
darkness
itself
and
of
the
shadow
of
death
without
any
order
and
where
the
light
is
as
darkness
then
answered
zophar
the
naamathite
and
said
should
not
the
multitude
of
words
be
answered
and
should
a
man
full
of
talk
be
justified
should
thy
lies
make
men
hold
their
peace
and
when
thou
mockest
shall
no
man
make
thee
ashamed
for
thou
hast
said
my
doctrine
is
pure
and
i
am
clean
in
thine
eyes
but
oh
that
god
would
speak
and
open
his
lips
against
thee
and
that
he
would
shew
thee
the
secrets
of
wisdom
that
they
are
double
to
that
which
is
know
therefore
that
god
exacteth
of
thee
less
than
thine
iniquity
deserveth
canst
thou
by
searching
find
out
god
canst
thou
find
out
the
almighty
unto
perfection
it
is
as
high
as
heaven
what
canst
thou
do
deeper
than
hell
what
canst
thou
know
the
measure
thereof
is
longer
than
the
earth
and
broader
than
the
sea
if
he
cut
off
and
shut
up
or
gather
together
then
who
can
hinder
him
for
he
knoweth
vain
men
he
seeth
wickedness
also
will
he
not
then
consider
it
for
vain
men
would
be
wise
though
man
be
born
like
a
wild
ass's
colt
if
thou
prepare
thine
heart
and
stretch
out
thine
hands
toward
him
if
iniquity
be
in
thine
hand
put
it
far
away
and
let
not
wickedness
dwell
in
thy
tabernacles
for
then
shalt
thou
lift
up
thy
face
without
spot
yea
thou
shalt
be
stedfast
and
shalt
not
fear
because
thou
shalt
forget
thy
misery
and
remember
it
as
waters
that
pass
away
and
thine
age
shall
be
clearer
than
the
noonday
thou
shalt
shine
forth
thou
shalt
be
as
the
morning
and
thou
shalt
be
secure
because
there
is
hope
yea
thou
shalt
dig
about
thee
and
thou
shalt
take
thy
rest
in
safety
also
thou
shalt
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
thee
afraid
yea
many
shall
make
suit
unto
thee
but
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
shall
fail
and
they
shall
not
escape
and
their
hope
shall
be
as
the
giving
up
of
the
ghost
and
job
answered
and
said
no
doubt
but
ye
are
the
people
and
wisdom
shall
die
with
you
but
i
have
understanding
as
well
as
you
i
am
not
inferior
to
you
yea
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
these
i
am
as
one
mocked
of
his
neighbour
who
calleth
upon
god
and
he
answereth
him
the
just
upright
man
is
laughed
to
scorn
he
that
is
ready
to
slip
with
his
feet
is
as
a
lamp
despised
in
the
thought
of
him
that
is
at
ease
the
tabernacles
of
robbers
prosper
and
they
that
provoke
god
are
secure
into
whose
hand
god
bringeth
abundantly
but
ask
now
the
beasts
and
they
shall
teach
thee
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
they
shall
tell
thee
or
speak
to
the
earth
and
it
shall
teach
thee
and
the
fishes
of
the
sea
shall
declare
unto
thee
who
knoweth
not
in
all
these
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
hath
wrought
this
in
whose
hand
is
the
soul
of
every
living
thing
and
the
breath
of
all
mankind
doth
not
the
ear
try
words
and
the
mouth
taste
his
meat
with
the
ancient
is
wisdom
and
in
length
of
days
understanding
with
him
is
wisdom
and
strength
he
hath
counsel
and
understanding
behold
he
breaketh
down
and
it
cannot
be
built
again
he
shutteth
up
a
man
and
there
can
be
no
opening
behold
he
withholdeth
the
waters
and
they
dry
up
also
he
sendeth
them
out
and
they
overturn
the
earth
with
him
is
strength
and
wisdom
the
deceived
and
the
deceiver
are
his
he
leadeth
counsellors
away
spoiled
and
maketh
the
judges
fools
he
looseth
the
bond
of
kings
and
girdeth
their
loins
with
a
girdle
he
leadeth
princes
away
spoiled
and
overthroweth
the
mighty
he
removeth
away
the
speech
of
the
trusty
and
taketh
away
the
understanding
of
the
aged
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
weakeneth
the
strength
of
the
mighty
he
discovereth
deep
things
out
of
darkness
and
bringeth
out
to
light
the
shadow
of
death
he
increaseth
the
nations
and
destroyeth
them
he
enlargeth
the
nations
and
straiteneth
them
again
he
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
of
the
people
of
the
earth
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no
way
they
grope
in
the
dark
without
light
and
he
maketh
them
to
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
lo
mine
eye
hath
seen
all
this
mine
ear
hath
heard
and
understood
it
what
ye
know
the
same
do
i
know
also
i
am
not
inferior
unto
you
surely
i
would
speak
to
the
almighty
and
i
desire
to
reason
with
god
but
ye
are
forgers
of
lies
ye
are
all
physicians
of
no
value
o
that
ye
would
altogether
hold
your
peace
and
it
should
be
your
wisdom
hear
now
my
reasoning
and
hearken
to
the
pleadings
of
my
lips
will
ye
speak
wickedly
for
god
and
talk
deceitfully
for
him
will
ye
accept
his
person
will
ye
contend
for
god
is
it
good
that
he
should
search
you
out
or
as
one
man
mocketh
another
do
ye
so
mock
him
he
will
surely
reprove
you
if
ye
do
secretly
accept
persons
shall
not
his
excellency
make
you
afraid
and
his
dread
fall
upon
you
your
remembrances
are
like
unto
ashes
your
bodies
to
bodies
of
clay
hold
your
peace
let
me
alone
that
i
may
speak
and
let
come
on
me
what
will
wherefore
do
i
take
my
flesh
in
my
teeth
and
put
my
life
in
mine
hand
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
but
i
will
maintain
mine
own
ways
before
him
he
also
shall
be
my
salvation
for
an
hypocrite
shall
not
come
before
him
hear
diligently
my
speech
and
my
declaration
with
your
ears
behold
now
i
have
ordered
my
cause
i
know
that
i
shall
be
justified
who
is
he
that
will
plead
with
me
for
now
if
i
hold
my
tongue
i
shall
give
up
the
ghost
only
do
not
two
things
unto
me
then
will
i
not
hide
myself
from
thee
withdraw
thine
hand
far
from
me
and
let
not
thy
dread
make
me
afraid
then
call
thou
and
i
will
answer
or
let
me
speak
and
answer
thou
me
how
many
are
mine
iniquities
and
sins
make
me
to
know
my
transgression
and
my
sin
wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face
and
holdest
me
for
thine
enemy
wilt
thou
break
a
leaf
driven
to
and
fro
and
wilt
thou
pursue
the
dry
stubble
for
thou
writest
bitter
things
against
me
and
makest
me
to
possess
the
iniquities
of
my
youth
thou
puttest
my
feet
also
in
the
stocks
and
lookest
narrowly
unto
all
my
paths
thou
settest
a
print
upon
the
heels
of
my
feet
and
he
as
a
rotten
thing
consumeth
as
a
garment
that
is
moth
eaten
man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
he
cometh
forth
like
a
flower
and
is
cut
down
he
fleeth
also
as
a
shadow
and
continueth
not
and
doth
thou
open
thine
eyes
upon
such
an
one
and
bringest
me
into
judgment
with
thee
who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean
not
one
seeing
his
days
are
determined
the
number
of
his
months
are
with
thee
thou
hast
appointed
his
bounds
that
he
cannot
pass
turn
from
him
that
he
may
rest
till
he
shall
accomplish
as
an
hireling
his
day
for
there
is
hope
of
a
tree
if
it
be
cut
down
that
it
will
sprout
again
and
that
the
tender
branch
thereof
will
not
cease
though
the
root
thereof
wax
old
in
the
earth
and
the
stock
thereof
die
in
the
ground
yet
through
the
scent
of
water
it
will
bud
and
bring
forth
boughs
like
a
plant
but
man
dieth
and
wasteth
away
yea
man
giveth
up
the
ghost
and
where
is
he
as
the
waters
fail
from
the
sea
and
the
flood
decayeth
and
drieth
up
so
man
lieth
down
and
riseth
not
till
the
heavens
be
no
more
they
shall
not
awake
nor
be
raised
out
of
their
sleep
o
that
thou
wouldest
hide
me
in
the
grave
that
thou
wouldest
keep
me
secret
until
thy
wrath
be
past
that
thou
wouldest
appoint
me
a
set
time
and
remember
me
if
a
man
die
shall
he
live
again
all
the
days
of
my
appointed
time
will
i
wait
till
my
change
come
thou
shalt
call
and
i
will
answer
thee
thou
wilt
have
a
desire
to
the
work
of
thine
hands
for
now
thou
numberest
my
steps
dost
thou
not
watch
over
my
sin
my
transgression
is
sealed
up
in
a
bag
and
thou
sewest
up
mine
iniquity
and
surely
the
mountains
falling
cometh
to
nought
and
the
rock
is
removed
out
of
his
place
the
waters
wear
the
stones
thou
washest
away
the
things
which
grow
out
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
thou
destroyest
the
hope
of
man
thou
prevailest
for
ever
against
him
and
he
passeth
thou
changest
his
countenance
and
sendest
him
away
his
sons
come
to
honour
and
he
knoweth
it
not
and
they
are
brought
low
but
he
perceiveth
it
not
of
them
but
his
flesh
upon
him
shall
have
pain
and
his
soul
within
him
shall
mourn
then
answered
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
said
should
a
wise
man
utter
vain
knowledge
and
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
wind
should
he
reason
with
unprofitable
talk
or
with
speeches
wherewith
he
can
do
no
good
yea
thou
castest
off
fear
and
restrainest
prayer
before
god
for
thy
mouth
uttereth
thine
iniquity
and
thou
choosest
the
tongue
of
the
crafty
thine
own
mouth
condemneth
thee
and
not
i
yea
thine
own
lips
testify
against
thee
art
thou
the
first
man
that
was
born
or
wast
thou
made
before
the
hills
hast
thou
heard
the
secret
of
god
and
dost
thou
restrain
wisdom
to
thyself
what
knowest
thou
that
we
know
not
what
understandest
thou
which
is
not
in
us
with
us
are
both
the
grayheaded
and
very
aged
men
much
elder
than
thy
father
are
the
consolations
of
god
small
with
thee
is
there
any
secret
thing
with
thee
why
doth
thine
heart
carry
thee
away
and
what
do
thy
eyes
wink
at
that
thou
turnest
thy
spirit
against
god
and
lettest
such
words
go
out
of
thy
mouth
what
is
man
that
he
should
be
clean
and
he
which
is
born
of
a
woman
that
he
should
be
righteous
behold
he
putteth
no
trust
in
his
saints
yea
the
heavens
are
not
clean
in
his
sight
how
much
more
abominable
and
filthy
is
man
which
drinketh
iniquity
like
water
i
will
shew
thee
hear
me
and
that
which
i
have
seen
i
will
declare
which
wise
men
have
told
from
their
fathers
and
have
not
hid
it
unto
whom
alone
the
earth
was
given
and
no
stranger
passed
among
them
the
wicked
man
travaileth
with
pain
all
his
days
and
the
number
of
years
is
hidden
to
the
oppressor
a
dreadful
sound
is
in
his
ears
in
prosperity
the
destroyer
shall
come
upon
him
he
believeth
not
that
he
shall
return
out
of
darkness
and
he
is
waited
for
of
the
sword
he
wandereth
abroad
for
bread
saying
where
is
it
he
knoweth
that
the
day
of
darkness
is
ready
at
his
hand
trouble
and
anguish
shall
make
him
afraid
they
shall
prevail
against
him
as
a
king
ready
to
the
battle
for
he
stretcheth
out
his
hand
against
god
and
strengtheneth
himself
against
the
almighty
he
runneth
upon
him
even
on
his
neck
upon
the
thick
bosses
of
his
bucklers
because
he
covereth
his
face
with
his
fatness
and
maketh
collops
of
fat
on
his
flanks
and
he
dwelleth
in
desolate
cities
and
in
houses
which
no
man
inhabiteth
which
are
ready
to
become
heaps
he
shall
not
be
rich
neither
shall
his
substance
continue
neither
shall
he
prolong
the
perfection
thereof
upon
the
earth
he
shall
not
depart
out
of
darkness
the
flame
shall
dry
up
his
branches
and
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
shall
he
go
away
let
not
him
that
is
deceived
trust
in
vanity
for
vanity
shall
be
his
recompence
it
shall
be
accomplished
before
his
time
and
his
branch
shall
not
be
green
he
shall
shake
off
his
unripe
grape
as
the
vine
and
shall
cast
off
his
flower
as
the
olive
for
the
congregation
of
hypocrites
shall
be
desolate
and
fire
shall
consume
the
tabernacles
of
bribery
they
conceive
mischief
and
bring
forth
vanity
and
their
belly
prepareth
deceit
then
job
answered
and
said
i
have
heard
many
such
things
miserable
comforters
are
ye
all
shall
vain
words
have
an
end
or
what
emboldeneth
thee
that
thou
answerest
i
also
could
speak
as
ye
do
if
your
soul
were
in
my
soul's
stead
i
could
heap
up
words
against
you
and
shake
mine
head
at
you
but
i
would
strengthen
you
with
my
mouth
and
the
moving
of
my
lips
should
asswage
your
grief
though
i
speak
my
grief
is
not
asswaged
and
though
i
forbear
what
am
i
eased
but
now
he
hath
made
me
weary
thou
hast
made
desolate
all
my
company
and
thou
hast
filled
me
with
wrinkles
which
is
a
witness
against
me
and
my
leanness
rising
up
in
me
beareth
witness
to
my
face
he
teareth
me
in
his
wrath
who
hateth
me
he
gnasheth
upon
me
with
his
teeth
mine
enemy
sharpeneth
his
eyes
upon
me
they
have
gaped
upon
me
with
their
mouth
they
have
smitten
me
upon
the
cheek
reproachfully
they
have
gathered
themselves
together
against
me
god
hath
delivered
me
to
the
ungodly
and
turned
me
over
into
the
hands
of
the
wicked
i
was
at
ease
but
he
hath
broken
me
asunder
he
hath
also
taken
me
by
my
neck
and
shaken
me
to
pieces
and
set
me
up
for
his
mark
his
archers
compass
me
round
about
he
cleaveth
my
reins
asunder
and
doth
not
spare
he
poureth
out
my
gall
upon
the
ground
he
breaketh
me
with
breach
upon
breach
he
runneth
upon
me
like
a
giant
i
have
sewed
sackcloth
upon
my
skin
and
defiled
my
horn
in
the
dust
my
face
is
foul
with
weeping
and
on
my
eyelids
is
the
shadow
of
death
not
for
any
injustice
in
mine
hands
also
my
prayer
is
pure
o
earth
cover
not
thou
my
blood
and
let
my
cry
have
no
place
also
now
behold
my
witness
is
in
heaven
and
my
record
is
on
high
my
friends
scorn
me
but
mine
eye
poureth
out
tears
unto
god
o
that
one
might
plead
for
a
man
with
god
as
a
man
pleadeth
for
his
neighbour
when
a
few
years
are
come
then
i
shall
go
the
way
whence
i
shall
not
return
my
breath
is
corrupt
my
days
are
extinct
the
graves
are
ready
for
me
are
there
not
mockers
with
me
and
doth
not
mine
eye
continue
in
their
provocation
lay
down
now
put
me
in
a
surety
with
thee
who
is
he
that
will
strike
hands
with
me
for
thou
hast
hid
their
heart
from
understanding
therefore
shalt
thou
not
exalt
them
he
that
speaketh
flattery
to
his
friends
even
the
eyes
of
his
children
shall
fail
he
hath
made
me
also
a
byword
of
the
people
and
aforetime
i
was
as
a
tabret
mine
eye
also
is
dim
by
reason
of
sorrow
and
all
my
members
are
as
a
shadow
upright
men
shall
be
astonied
at
this
and
the
innocent
shall
stir
up
himself
against
the
hypocrite
the
righteous
also
shall
hold
on
his
way
and
he
that
hath
clean
hands
shall
be
stronger
and
stronger
but
as
for
you
all
do
ye
return
and
come
now
for
i
cannot
find
one
wise
man
among
you
my
days
are
past
my
purposes
are
broken
off
even
the
thoughts
of
my
heart
they
change
the
night
into
day
the
light
is
short
because
of
darkness
if
i
wait
the
grave
is
mine
house
i
have
made
my
bed
in
the
darkness
i
have
said
to
corruption
thou
art
my
father
to
the
worm
thou
art
my
mother
and
my
sister
and
where
is
now
my
hope
as
for
my
hope
who
shall
see
it
they
shall
go
down
to
the
bars
of
the
pit
when
our
rest
together
is
in
the
dust
then
answered
bildad
the
shuhite
and
said
how
long
will
it
be
ere
ye
make
an
end
of
words
mark
and
afterwards
we
will
speak
wherefore
are
we
counted
as
beasts
and
reputed
vile
in
your
sight
he
teareth
himself
in
his
anger
shall
the
earth
be
forsaken
for
thee
and
shall
the
rock
be
removed
out
of
his
place
yea
the
light
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
and
the
spark
of
his
fire
shall
not
shine
the
light
shall
be
dark
in
his
tabernacle
and
his
candle
shall
be
put
out
with
him
the
steps
of
his
strength
shall
be
straitened
and
his
own
counsel
shall
cast
him
down
for
he
is
cast
into
a
net
by
his
own
feet
and
he
walketh
upon
a
snare
the
gin
shall
take
him
by
the
heel
and
the
robber
shall
prevail
against
him
the
snare
is
laid
for
him
in
the
ground
and
a
trap
for
him
in
the
way
terrors
shall
make
him
afraid
on
every
side
and
shall
drive
him
to
his
feet
his
strength
shall
be
hungerbitten
and
destruction
shall
be
ready
at
his
side
it
shall
devour
the
strength
of
his
skin
even
the
firstborn
of
death
shall
devour
his
strength
his
confidence
shall
be
rooted
out
of
his
tabernacle
and
it
shall
bring
him
to
the
king
of
terrors
it
shall
dwell
in
his
tabernacle
because
it
is
none
of
his
brimstone
shall
be
scattered
upon
his
habitation
his
roots
shall
be
dried
up
beneath
and
above
shall
his
branch
be
cut
off
his
remembrance
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
he
shall
have
no
name
in
the
street
he
shall
be
driven
from
light
into
darkness
and
chased
out
of
the
world
he
shall
neither
have
son
nor
nephew
among
his
people
nor
any
remaining
in
his
dwellings
they
that
come
after
him
shall
be
astonied
at
his
day
as
they
that
went
before
were
affrighted
surely
such
are
the
dwellings
of
the
wicked
and
this
is
the
place
of
him
that
knoweth
not
god
then
job
answered
and
said
how
long
will
ye
vex
my
soul
and
break
me
in
pieces
with
words
these
ten
times
have
ye
reproached
me
ye
are
not
ashamed
that
ye
make
yourselves
strange
to
me
and
be
it
indeed
that
i
have
erred
mine
error
remaineth
with
myself
if
indeed
ye
will
magnify
yourselves
against
me
and
plead
against
me
my
reproach
know
now
that
god
hath
overthrown
me
and
hath
compassed
me
with
his
net
behold
i
cry
out
of
wrong
but
i
am
not
heard
i
cry
aloud
but
there
is
no
judgment
he
hath
fenced
up
my
way
that
i
cannot
pass
and
he
hath
set
darkness
in
my
paths
he
hath
stripped
me
of
my
glory
and
taken
the
crown
from
my
head
he
hath
destroyed
me
on
every
side
and
i
am
gone
and
mine
hope
hath
he
removed
like
a
tree
he
hath
also
kindled
his
wrath
against
me
and
he
counteth
me
unto
him
as
one
of
his
enemies
his
troops
come
together
and
raise
up
their
way
against
me
and
encamp
round
about
my
tabernacle
he
hath
put
my
brethren
far
from
me
and
mine
acquaintance
are
verily
estranged
from
me
my
kinsfolk
have
failed
and
my
familiar
friends
have
forgotten
me
they
that
dwell
in
mine
house
and
my
maids
count
me
for
a
stranger
i
am
an
alien
in
their
sight
i
called
my
servant
and
he
gave
me
no
answer
i
intreated
him
with
my
mouth
my
breath
is
strange
to
my
wife
though
i
intreated
for
the
children's
sake
of
mine
own
body
yea
young
children
despised
me
i
arose
and
they
spake
against
me
all
my
inward
friends
abhorred
me
and
they
whom
i
loved
are
turned
against
me
my
bone
cleaveth
to
my
skin
and
to
my
flesh
and
i
am
escaped
with
the
skin
of
my
teeth
have
pity
upon
me
have
pity
upon
me
o
ye
my
friends
for
the
hand
of
god
hath
touched
me
why
do
ye
persecute
me
as
god
and
are
not
satisfied
with
my
flesh
oh
that
my
words
were
now
written
oh
that
they
were
printed
in
a
book
that
they
were
graven
with
an
iron
pen
and
lead
in
the
rock
for
ever
for
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
and
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
whom
i
shall
see
for
myself
and
mine
eyes
shall
behold
and
not
another
though
my
reins
be
consumed
within
me
but
ye
should
say
why
persecute
we
him
seeing
the
root
of
the
matter
is
found
in
me
be
ye
afraid
of
the
sword
for
wrath
bringeth
the
punishments
of
the
sword
that
ye
may
know
there
is
a
judgment
then
answered
zophar
the
naamathite
and
said
therefore
do
my
thoughts
cause
me
to
answer
and
for
this
i
make
haste
i
have
heard
the
check
of
my
reproach
and
the
spirit
of
my
understanding
causeth
me
to
answer
knowest
thou
not
this
of
old
since
man
was
placed
upon
earth
that
the
triumphing
of
the
wicked
is
short
and
the
joy
of
the
hypocrite
but
for
a
moment
though
his
excellency
mount
up
to
the
heavens
and
his
head
reach
unto
the
clouds
yet
he
shall
perish
for
ever
like
his
own
dung
they
which
have
seen
him
shall
say
where
is
he
he
shall
fly
away
as
a
dream
and
shall
not
be
found
yea
he
shall
be
chased
away
as
a
vision
of
the
night
the
eye
also
which
saw
him
shall
see
him
no
more
neither
shall
his
place
any
more
behold
him
his
children
shall
seek
to
please
the
poor
and
his
hands
shall
restore
their
goods
his
bones
are
full
of
the
sin
of
his
youth
which
shall
lie
down
with
him
in
the
dust
though
wickedness
be
sweet
in
his
mouth
though
he
hide
it
under
his
tongue
though
he
spare
it
and
forsake
it
not
but
keep
it
still
within
his
mouth
yet
his
meat
in
his
bowels
is
turned
it
is
the
gall
of
asps
within
him
he
hath
swallowed
down
riches
and
he
shall
vomit
them
up
again
god
shall
cast
them
out
of
his
belly
he
shall
suck
the
poison
of
asps
the
viper's
tongue
shall
slay
him
he
shall
not
see
the
rivers
the
floods
the
brooks
of
honey
and
butter
that
which
he
laboured
for
shall
he
restore
and
shall
not
swallow
it
down
according
to
his
substance
shall
the
restitution
be
and
he
shall
not
rejoice
therein
because
he
hath
oppressed
and
hath
forsaken
the
poor
because
he
hath
violently
taken
away
an
house
which
he
builded
not
surely
he
shall
not
feel
quietness
in
his
belly
he
shall
not
save
of
that
which
he
desired
there
shall
none
of
his
meat
be
left
therefore
shall
no
man
look
for
his
goods
in
the
fulness
of
his
sufficiency
he
shall
be
in
straits
every
hand
of
the
wicked
shall
come
upon
him
when
he
is
about
to
fill
his
belly
god
shall
cast
the
fury
of
his
wrath
upon
him
and
shall
rain
it
upon
him
while
he
is
eating
he
shall
flee
from
the
iron
weapon
and
the
bow
of
steel
shall
strike
him
through
it
is
drawn
and
cometh
out
of
the
body
yea
the
glittering
sword
cometh
out
of
his
gall
terrors
are
upon
him
all
darkness
shall
be
hid
in
his
secret
places
a
fire
not
blown
shall
consume
him
it
shall
go
ill
with
him
that
is
left
in
his
tabernacle
the
heaven
shall
reveal
his
iniquity
and
the
earth
shall
rise
up
against
him
the
increase
of
his
house
shall
depart
and
his
goods
shall
flow
away
in
the
day
of
his
wrath
this
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
from
god
and
the
heritage
appointed
unto
him
by
god
but
job
answered
and
said
hear
diligently
my
speech
and
let
this
be
your
consolations
suffer
me
that
i
may
speak
and
after
that
i
have
spoken
mock
on
as
for
me
is
my
complaint
to
man
and
if
it
were
so
why
should
not
my
spirit
be
troubled
mark
me
and
be
astonished
and
lay
your
hand
upon
your
mouth
even
when
i
remember
i
am
afraid
and
trembling
taketh
hold
on
my
flesh
wherefore
do
the
wicked
live
become
old
yea
are
mighty
in
power
their
seed
is
established
in
their
sight
with
them
and
their
offspring
before
their
eyes
their
houses
are
safe
from
fear
neither
is
the
rod
of
god
upon
them
their
bull
gendereth
and
faileth
not
their
cow
calveth
and
casteth
not
her
calf
they
send
forth
their
little
ones
like
a
flock
and
their
children
dance
they
take
the
timbrel
and
harp
and
rejoice
at
the
sound
of
the
organ
they
spend
their
days
in
wealth
and
in
a
moment
go
down
to
the
grave
therefore
they
say
unto
god
depart
from
us
for
we
desire
not
the
knowledge
of
thy
ways
what
is
the
almighty
that
we
should
serve
him
and
what
profit
should
we
have
if
we
pray
unto
him
lo
their
good
is
not
in
their
hand
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me
how
oft
is
the
candle
of
the
wicked
put
out
and
how
oft
cometh
their
destruction
upon
them
god
distributeth
sorrows
in
his
anger
they
are
as
stubble
before
the
wind
and
as
chaff
that
the
storm
carrieth
away
god
layeth
up
his
iniquity
for
his
children
he
rewardeth
him
and
he
shall
know
it
his
eyes
shall
see
his
destruction
and
he
shall
drink
of
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
for
what
pleasure
hath
he
in
his
house
after
him
when
the
number
of
his
months
is
cut
off
in
the
midst
shall
any
teach
god
knowledge
seeing
he
judgeth
those
that
are
high
one
dieth
in
his
full
strength
being
wholly
at
ease
and
quiet
his
breasts
are
full
of
milk
and
his
bones
are
moistened
with
marrow
and
another
dieth
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
and
never
eateth
with
pleasure
they
shall
lie
down
alike
in
the
dust
and
the
worms
shall
cover
them
behold
i
know
your
thoughts
and
the
devices
which
ye
wrongfully
imagine
against
me
for
ye
say
where
is
the
house
of
the
prince
and
where
are
the
dwelling
places
of
the
wicked
have
ye
not
asked
them
that
go
by
the
way
and
do
ye
not
know
their
tokens
that
the
wicked
is
reserved
to
the
day
of
destruction
they
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
day
of
wrath
who
shall
declare
his
way
to
his
face
and
who
shall
repay
him
what
he
hath
done
yet
shall
he
be
brought
to
the
grave
and
shall
remain
in
the
tomb
the
clods
of
the
valley
shall
be
sweet
unto
him
and
every
man
shall
draw
after
him
as
there
are
innumerable
before
him
how
then
comfort
ye
me
in
vain
seeing
in
your
answers
there
remaineth
falsehood
then
eliphaz
the
temanite
answered
and
said
can
a
man
be
profitable
unto
god
as
he
that
is
wise
may
be
profitable
unto
himself
is
it
any
pleasure
to
the
almighty
that
thou
art
righteous
or
is
it
gain
to
him
that
thou
makest
thy
ways
perfect
will
he
reprove
thee
for
fear
of
thee
will
he
enter
with
thee
into
judgment
is
not
thy
wickedness
great
and
thine
iniquities
infinite
for
thou
hast
taken
a
pledge
from
thy
brother
for
nought
and
stripped
the
naked
of
their
clothing
thou
hast
not
given
water
to
the
weary
to
drink
and
thou
hast
withholden
bread
from
the
hungry
but
as
for
the
mighty
man
he
had
the
earth
and
the
honourable
man
dwelt
in
it
thou
hast
sent
widows
away
empty
and
the
arms
of
the
fatherless
have
been
broken
therefore
snares
are
round
about
thee
and
sudden
fear
troubleth
thee
or
darkness
that
thou
canst
not
see
and
abundance
of
waters
cover
thee
is
not
god
in
the
height
of
heaven
and
behold
the
height
of
the
stars
how
high
they
are
and
thou
sayest
how
doth
god
know
can
he
judge
through
the
dark
cloud
thick
clouds
are
a
covering
to
him
that
he
seeth
not
and
he
walketh
in
the
circuit
of
heaven
hast
thou
marked
the
old
way
which
wicked
men
have
trodden
which
were
cut
down
out
of
time
whose
foundation
was
overflown
with
a
flood
which
said
unto
god
depart
from
us
and
what
can
the
almighty
do
for
them
yet
he
filled
their
houses
with
good
things
but
the
counsel
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me
the
righteous
see
it
and
are
glad
and
the
innocent
laugh
them
to
scorn
whereas
our
substance
is
not
cut
down
but
the
remnant
of
them
the
fire
consumeth
acquaint
now
thyself
with
him
and
be
at
peace
thereby
good
shall
come
unto
thee
receive
i
pray
thee
the
law
from
his
mouth
and
lay
up
his
words
in
thine
heart
if
thou
return
to
the
almighty
thou
shalt
be
built
up
thou
shalt
put
away
iniquity
far
from
thy
tabernacles
then
shalt
thou
lay
up
gold
as
dust
and
the
gold
of
ophir
as
the
stones
of
the
brooks
yea
the
almighty
shall
be
thy
defence
and
thou
shalt
have
plenty
of
silver
for
then
shalt
thou
have
thy
delight
in
the
almighty
and
shalt
lift
up
thy
face
unto
god
thou
shalt
make
thy
prayer
unto
him
and
he
shall
hear
thee
and
thou
shalt
pay
thy
vows
thou
shalt
also
decree
a
thing
and
it
shall
be
established
unto
thee
and
the
light
shall
shine
upon
thy
ways
when
men
are
cast
down
then
thou
shalt
say
there
is
lifting
up
and
he
shall
save
the
humble
person
he
shall
deliver
the
island
of
the
innocent
and
it
is
delivered
by
the
pureness
of
thine
hands
then
job
answered
and
said
even
to
day
is
my
complaint
bitter
my
stroke
is
heavier
than
my
groaning
oh
that
i
knew
where
i
might
find
him
that
i
might
come
even
to
his
seat
i
would
order
my
cause
before
him
and
fill
my
mouth
with
arguments
i
would
know
the
words
which
he
would
answer
me
and
understand
what
he
would
say
unto
me
will
he
plead
against
me
with
his
great
power
no
but
he
would
put
strength
in
me
there
the
righteous
might
dispute
with
him
so
should
i
be
delivered
for
ever
from
my
judge
behold
i
go
forward
but
he
is
not
there
and
backward
but
i
cannot
perceive
him
on
the
left
hand
where
he
doth
work
but
i
cannot
behold
him
he
hideth
himself
on
the
right
hand
that
i
cannot
see
him
but
he
knoweth
the
way
that
i
take
when
he
hath
tried
me
i
shall
come
forth
as
gold
my
foot
hath
held
his
steps
his
way
have
i
kept
and
not
declined
neither
have
i
gone
back
from
the
commandment
of
his
lips
i
have
esteemed
the
words
of
his
mouth
more
than
my
necessary
food
but
he
is
in
one
mind
and
who
can
turn
him
and
what
his
soul
desireth
even
that
he
doeth
for
he
performeth
the
thing
that
is
appointed
for
me
and
many
such
things
are
with
him
therefore
am
i
troubled
at
his
presence
when
i
consider
i
am
afraid
of
him
for
god
maketh
my
heart
soft
and
the
almighty
troubleth
me
because
i
was
not
cut
off
before
the
darkness
neither
hath
he
covered
the
darkness
from
my
face
why
seeing
times
are
not
hidden
from
the
almighty
do
they
that
know
him
not
see
his
days
some
remove
the
landmarks
they
violently
take
away
flocks
and
feed
thereof
they
drive
away
the
ass
of
the
fatherless
they
take
the
widow's
ox
for
a

they
forth
to
their

the
wilderness
yieldeth

they
reap

his
corn
in

the

of
the
wicked
they

to
lodge

that
they

no

in
the
cold
they
are
wet
with

the

his

they

low
they
are

if

so
now
who

make

nothing

answered

dominion

he

peace
in

places
is
there
any

upon

how
then
can
man
be

how
can
he
be
clean
that

behold

the

how
much
less

answered
and

how

him
that

how
savest
thou
the

that
hath
no

how
hast
thou
counselled
him
that
hath
no

how
hast
thou
plentifully
declared
the
thing
as
it
is
to
whom
hast
thou
uttered
words
and
whose
spirit
came
from
thee
dead
things
are
formed
from
under

and
the

thereof
hell
is
naked
before
him
and
destruction
hath
no

he
stretcheth
out
the
north
over
the
empty

and
hangeth
the
earth
upon
nothing
he
bindeth
up
the
waters
in
his
thick
clouds
and
the
cloud
is
not
rent
under

he
holdeth
back
the

of
his

and
spreadeth
his
cloud
upon

he
hath
compassed
the

with
bounds
until
the

and
night
come
to
an

the
pillars
of

tremble
and
are
astonished
at

he

by

understanding
he
smiteth
through
the
proud
by
his
spirit
he
hath
garnished
the

his
hand
hath
formed
the
crooked
serpent
lo
these
are
parts
of
his
ways
but
how
little
a
portion
is
heard
of
him
but
the
thunder
of
his
power
who
can
understand
moreover
job
continued
his
parable
and
said
as
god
liveth
who
hath
taken
away
my
judgment
and
the
almighty
who
hath
vexed
my
soul
all
the
while
my
breath
is
in
me
and
the
spirit
of
god
is
in
my
nostrils
my
lips
shall
not
speak
wickedness
nor
my
tongue
utter
deceit
god
forbid
that
i
should
justify
you
till
i
die
i
will
not
remove
mine
integrity
from
me
my
righteousness
i
hold
fast
and
will
not
let
it
go
my
heart
shall
not
reproach
me
so
long
as
i
live
let
mine
enemy
be
as
the
wicked
and
he
that
riseth
up
against
me
as
the
unrighteous
for
what
is
the
hope
of
the
hypocrite
though
he
hath
gained
when
god
taketh
away
his
soul
will
god
hear
his
cry
when
trouble
cometh
upon
him
will
he
delight
himself
in
the
almighty
will
he
always
call
upon
god
i
will
teach
you
by
the
hand
of
god
that
which
is
with
the
almighty
will
i
not
conceal
behold
all
ye
yourselves
have
seen
it
why
then
are
ye
thus
altogether
vain
this
is
the
portion
of
a
wicked
man
with
god
and
the
heritage
of
oppressors
which
they
shall
receive
of
the
almighty
if
his
children
be
multiplied
it
is
for
the
sword
and
his
offspring
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
bread
those
that
remain
of
him
shall
be
buried
in
death
and
his
widows
shall
not
weep
though
he
heap
up
silver
as
the
dust
and
prepare
raiment
as
the
clay
he
may
prepare
it
but
the
just
shall
put
it
on
and
the
innocent
shall
divide
the
silver
he
buildeth
his
house
as
a
moth
and
as
a
booth
that
the
keeper
maketh
the
rich
man
shall
lie
down
but
he
shall
not
be
gathered
he
openeth
his
eyes
and
he
is
not
terrors
take
hold
on
him
as
waters
a
tempest
stealeth
him
away
in
the
night
the
east
wind
carrieth
him
away
and
he
departeth
and
as
a
storm
hurleth
him
out
of
his
place
for
god
shall
cast
upon
him
and
not
spare
he
would
fain
flee
out
of
his
hand
men
shall
clap
their
hands
at
him
and
shall
hiss
him
out
of
his
place
surely
there
is
a
vein
for
the
silver
and
a
place
for
gold
where
they
fine
it
iron
is
taken
out
of
the
earth
and
brass
is
molten
out
of
the
stone
he
setteth
an
end
to
darkness
and
searcheth
out
all
perfection
the
stones
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
the
flood
breaketh
out
from
the
inhabitant
even
the
waters
forgotten
of
the
foot
they
are
dried
up
they
are
gone
away
from
men
as
for
the
earth
out
of
it
cometh
bread
and
under
it
is
turned
up
as
it
were
fire
the
stones
of
it
are
the
place
of
sapphires
and
it
hath
dust
of
gold
there
is
a
path
which
no
fowl
knoweth
and
which
the
vulture's
eye
hath
not
seen
the
lion's
whelps
have
not
trodden
it
nor
the
fierce
lion
passed
by
it
he
putteth
forth
his
hand
upon
the
rock
he
overturneth
the
mountains
by
the
roots
he
cutteth
out
rivers
among
the
rocks
and
his
eye
seeth
every
precious
thing
he
bindeth
the
floods
from
overflowing
and
the
thing
that
is
hid
bringeth
he
forth
to
light
but
where
shall
wisdom
be
found
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof
neither
is
it
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
the
depth
saith
it
is
not
in
me
and
the
sea
saith
it
is
not
with
me
it
cannot
be
gotten
for
gold
neither
shall
silver
be
weighed
for
the
price
thereof
it
cannot
be
valued
with
the
gold
of
ophir
with
the
precious
onyx
or
the
sapphire
the
gold
and
the
crystal
cannot
equal
it
and
the
exchange
of
it
shall
not
be
for
jewels
of
fine
gold
no
mention
shall
be
made
of
coral
or
of
pearls
for
the
price
of
wisdom
is
above
rubies
the
topaz
of
ethiopia
shall
not
equal
it
neither
shall
it
be
valued
with
pure
gold
whence
then
cometh
wisdom
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
seeing
it
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
living
and
kept
close
from
the
fowls
of
the
air
destruction
and
death
say
we
have
heard
the
fame
thereof
with
our
ears
god
understandeth
the
way
thereof
and
he
knoweth
the
place
thereof
for
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven
to
make
the
weight
for
the
winds
and
he
weigheth
the
waters
by
measure
when
he
made
a
decree
for
the
rain
and
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
the
thunder
then
did
he
see
it
and
declare
it
he
prepared
it
yea
and
searched
it
out
and
unto
man
he
said
behold
the
fear
of
the
lord
that
is
wisdom
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding
moreover
job
continued
his
parable
and
said
oh
that
i
were
as
in
months
past
as
in
the
days
when
god
preserved
me
when
his
candle
shined
upon
my
head
and
when
by
his
light
i
walked
through
darkness
as
i
was
in
the
days
of
my
youth
when
the
secret
of
god
was
upon
my
tabernacle
when
the
almighty
was
yet
with
me
when
my
children
were
about
me
when
i
washed
my
steps
with
butter
and
the
rock
poured
me
out
rivers
of
oil
when
i
went
out
to
the
gate
through
the
city
when
i
prepared
my
seat
in
the
street
the
young
men
saw
me
and
hid
themselves
and
the
aged
arose
and
stood
up
the
princes
refrained
talking
and
laid
their
hand
on
their
mouth
the
nobles
held
their
peace
and
their
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
their
mouth
when
the
ear
heard
me
then
it
blessed
me
and
when
the
eye
saw
me
it
gave
witness
to
me
because
i
delivered
the
poor
that
cried
and
the
fatherless
and
him
that
had
none
to
help
him
the
blessing
of
him
that
was
ready
to
perish
came
upon
me
and
i
caused
the
widow's
heart
to
sing
for
joy
i
put
on
righteousness
and
it
clothed
me
my
judgment
was
as
a
robe
and
a
diadem
i
was
eyes
to
the
blind
and
feet
was
i
to
the
lame
i
was
a
father
to
the
poor
and
the
cause
which
i
knew
not
i
searched
out
and
i
brake
the
jaws
of
the
wicked
and
plucked
the
spoil
out
of
his
teeth
then
i
said
i
shall
die
in
my
nest
and
i
shall
multiply
my
days
as
the
sand
my
root
was
spread
out
by
the
waters
and
the
dew
lay
all
night
upon
my
branch
my
glory
was
fresh
in
me
and
my
bow
was
renewed
in
my
hand
unto
me
men
gave
ear
and
waited
and
kept
silence
at
my
counsel
after
my
words
they
spake
not
again
and
my
speech
dropped
upon
them
and
they
waited
for
me
as
for
the
rain
and
they
opened
their
mouth
wide
as
for
the
latter
rain
if
i
laughed
on
them
they
believed
it
not
and
the
light
of
my
countenance
they
cast
not
down
i
chose
out
their
way
and
sat
chief
and
dwelt
as
a
king
in
the
army
as
one
that
comforteth
the
mourners
but
now
they
that
are
younger
than
i
have
me
in
derision
whose
fathers
i
would
have
disdained
to
have
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
flock
yea
whereto
might
the
strength
of
their
hands
profit
me
in
whom
old
age
was
perished
for
want
and
famine
they
were
solitary
fleeing
into
the
wilderness
in
former
time
desolate
and
waste
who
cut
up
mallows
by
the
bushes
and
juniper
roots
for
their
meat
they
were
driven
forth
from
among
men
they
cried
after
them
as
after
a
thief
to
dwell
in
the
cliffs
of
the
valleys
in
caves
of
the
earth
and
in
the
rocks
among
the
bushes
they
brayed
under
the
nettles
they
were
gathered
together
they
were
children
of
fools
yea
children
of
base
men
they
were
viler
than
the
earth
and
now
am
i
their
song
yea
i
am
their
byword
they
abhor
me
they
flee
far
from
me
and
spare
not
to
spit
in
my
face
because
he
hath
loosed
my
cord
and
afflicted
me
they
have
also
let
loose
the
bridle
before
me
upon
my
right
hand
rise
the
youth
they
push
away
my
feet
and
they
raise
up
against
me
the
ways
of
their
destruction
they
mar
my
path
they
set
forward
my
calamity
they
have
no
helper
they
came
upon
me
as
a
wide
breaking
in
of
waters
in
the
desolation
they
rolled
themselves
upon
me
terrors
are
turned
upon
me
they
pursue
my
soul
as
the
wind
and
my
welfare
passeth
away
as
a
cloud
and
now
my
soul
is
poured
out
upon
me
the
days
of
affliction
have
taken
hold
upon
me
my
bones
are
pierced
in
me
in
the
night
season
and
my
sinews
take
no
rest
by
the
great
force
of
my
disease
is
my
garment
changed
it
bindeth
me
about
as
the
collar
of
my
coat
he
hath
cast
me
into
the
mire
and
i
am
become
like
dust
and
ashes
i
cry
unto
thee
and
thou
dost
not
hear
me
i
stand
up
and
thou
regardest
me
not
thou
art
become
cruel
to
me
with
thy
strong
hand
thou
opposest
thyself
against
me
thou
liftest
me
up
to
the
wind
thou
causest
me
to
ride
upon
it
and
dissolvest
my
substance
for
i
know
that
thou
wilt
bring
me
to
death
and
to
the
house
appointed
for
all
living
howbeit
he
will
not
stretch
out
his
hand
to
the
grave
though
they
cry
in
his
destruction
did
not
i
weep
for
him
that
was
in
trouble
was
not
my
soul
grieved
for
the
poor
when
i
looked
for
good
then
evil
came
unto
me
and
when
i
waited
for
light
there
came
darkness
my
bowels
boiled
and
rested
not
the
days
of
affliction
prevented
me
i
went
mourning
without
the
sun
i
stood
up
and
i
cried
in
the
congregation
i
am
a
brother
to
dragons
and
a
companion
to
owls
my
skin
is
black
upon
me
and
my
bones
are
burned
with
heat
my
harp
also
is
turned
to
mourning
and
my
organ
into
the
voice
of
them
that
weep
i
made
a
covenant
with
mine
eyes
why
then
should
i
think
upon
a
maid
for
what
portion
of
god
is
there
from
above
and
what
inheritance
of
the
almighty
from
on
high
is
not
destruction
to
the
wicked
and
a
strange
punishment
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
doth
not
he
see
my
ways
and
count
all
my
steps
if
i
have
walked
with
vanity
or
if
my
foot
hath
hasted
to
deceit
let
me
be
weighed
in
an
even
balance
that
god
may
know
mine
integrity
if
my
step
hath
turned
out
of
the
way
and
mine
heart
walked
after
mine
eyes
and
if
any
blot
hath
cleaved
to
mine
hands
then
let
me
sow
and
let
another
eat
yea
let
my
offspring
be
rooted
out
if
mine
heart
have
been
deceived
by
a
woman
or
if
i
have
laid
wait
at
my
neighbour's
door
then
let
my
wife
grind
unto
another
and
let
others
bow
down
upon
her
for
this
is
an
heinous
crime
yea
it
is
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judges
for
it
is
a
fire
that
consumeth
to
destruction
and
would
root
out
all
mine
increase
if
i
did
despise
the
cause
of
my
manservant
or
of
my
maidservant
when
they
contended
with
me
what
then
shall
i
do
when
god
riseth
up
and
when
he
visiteth
what
shall
i
answer
him
did
not
he
that
made
me
in
the
womb
make
him
and
did
not
one
fashion
us
in
the
womb
if
i
have
withheld
the
poor
from
their
desire
or
have
caused
the
eyes
of
the
widow
to
fail
or
have
eaten
my
morsel
myself
alone
and
the
fatherless
hath
not
eaten
thereof
for
from
my
youth
he
was
brought
up
with
me
as
with
a
father
and
i
have
guided
her
from
my
mother's
womb
if
i
have
seen
any
perish
for
want
of
clothing
or
any
poor
without
covering
if
his
loins
have
not
blessed
me
and
if
he
were
not
warmed
with
the
fleece
of
my
sheep
if
i
have
lifted
up
my
hand
against
the
fatherless
when
i
saw
my
help
in
the
gate
then
let
mine
arm
fall
from
my
shoulder
blade
and
mine
arm
be
broken
from
the
bone
for
destruction
from
god
was
a
terror
to
me
and
by
reason
of
his
highness
i
could
not
endure
if
i
have
made
gold
my
hope
or
have
said
to
the
fine
gold
thou
art
my
confidence
if
i
rejoice
because
my
wealth
was
great
and
because
mine
hand
had
gotten
much
if
i
beheld
the
sun
when
it
shined
or
the
moon
walking
in
brightness
and
my
heart
hath
been
secretly
enticed
or
my
mouth
hath
kissed
my
hand
this
also
were
an
iniquity
to
be
punished
by
the
judge
for
i
should
have
denied
the
god
that
is
above
if
i
rejoice
at
the
destruction
of
him
that
hated
me
or
lifted
up
myself
when
evil
found
him
neither
have
i
suffered
my
mouth
to
sin
by
wishing
a
curse
to
his
soul
if
the
men
of
my
tabernacle
said
not
oh
that
we
had
of
his
flesh
we
cannot
be
satisfied
the
stranger
did
not
lodge
in
the
street
but
i
opened
my
doors
to
the
traveller
if
i
covered
my
transgressions
as
adam
by
hiding
mine
iniquity
in
my
bosom
did
i
fear
a
great
multitude
or
did
the
contempt
of
families
terrify
me
that
i
kept
silence
and
went
not
out
of
the
door
oh
that
one
would
hear
me
behold
my
desire
is
that
the
almighty
would
answer
me
and
that
mine
adversary
had
written
a
book
surely
i
would
take
it
upon
my
shoulder
and
bind
it
as
a
crown
to
me
i
would
declare
unto
him
the
number
of
my
steps
as
a
prince
would
i
go
near
unto
him
if
my
land
cry
against
me
or
that
the
furrows
likewise
thereof
complain
if
i
have
eaten
the
fruits
thereof
without
money
or
have
caused
the
owners
thereof
to
lose
their
life
let
thistles
grow
instead
of
wheat
and
cockle
instead
of
barley
the
words
of
job
are
ended
so
these
three
men
ceased
to
answer
job
because
he
was
righteous
in
his
own
eyes
then
was
kindled
the
wrath
of
elihu
the
son
of
barachel
the
buzite
of
the
kindred
of
ram
against
job
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
he
justified
himself
rather
than
god
also
against
his
three
friends
was
his
wrath
kindled
because
they
had
found
no
answer
and
yet
had
condemned
job
now
elihu
had
waited
till
job
had
spoken
because
they
were
elder
than
he
when
elihu
saw
that
there
was
no
answer
in
the
mouth
of
these
three
men
then
his
wrath
was
kindled
and
elihu
the
son
of
barachel
the
buzite
answered
and
said
i
am
young
and
ye
are
very
old
wherefore
i
was
afraid
and
durst
not
shew
you
mine
opinion
i
said
days
should
speak
and
multitude
of
years
should
teach
wisdom
but
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
and
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
giveth
them
understanding
great
men
are
not
always
wise
neither
do
the
aged
understand
judgment
therefore
i
said
hearken
to
me
i
also
will
shew
mine
opinion
behold
i
waited
for
your
words
i
gave
ear
to
your
reasons
whilst
ye
searched
out
what
to
say
yea
i
attended
unto
you
and
behold
there
was
none
of
you
that
convinced
job
or
that
answered
his
words
lest
ye
should
say
we
have
found
out
wisdom
god
thrusteth
him
down
not
man
now
he
hath
not
directed
his
words
against
me
neither
will
i
answer
him
with
your
speeches
they
were
amazed
they
answered
no
more
they
left
off
speaking
when
i
had
waited
for
they
spake
not
but
stood
still
and
answered
no
more
i
said
i
will
answer
also
my
part
i
also
will
shew
mine
opinion
for
i
am
full
of
matter
the
spirit
within
me
constraineth
me
behold
my
belly
is
as
wine
which
hath
no
vent
it
is
ready
to
burst
like
new
bottles
i
will
speak
that
i
may
be
refreshed
i
will
open
my
lips
and
answer
let
me
not
i
pray
you
accept
any
man's
person
neither
let
me
give
flattering
titles
unto
man
for
i
know
not
to
give
flattering
titles
in
so
doing
my
maker
would
soon
take
me
away
wherefore
job
i
pray
thee
hear
my
speeches
and
hearken
to
all
my
words
behold
now
i
have
opened
my
mouth
my
tongue
hath
spoken
in
my
mouth
my
words
shall
be
of
the
uprightness
of
my
heart
and
my
lips
shall
utter
knowledge
clearly
the
spirit
of
god
hath
made
me
and
the
breath
of
the
almighty
hath
given
me
life
if
thou
canst
answer
me
set
thy
words
in
order
before
me
stand
up
behold
i
am
according
to
thy
wish
in
god's
stead
i
also
am
formed
out
of
the
clay
behold
my
terror
shall
not
make
thee
afraid
neither
shall
my
hand
be
heavy
upon
thee
surely
thou
hast
spoken
in
mine
hearing
and
i
have
heard
the
voice
of
thy
words
saying
i
am
clean
without
transgression
i
am
innocent
neither
is
there
iniquity
in
me
behold
he
findeth
occasions
against
me
he
counteth
me
for
his
enemy
he
putteth
my
feet
in
the
stocks
he
marketh
all
my
paths
behold
in
this
thou
art
not
just
i
will
answer
thee
that
god
is
greater
than
man
why
dost
thou
strive
against
him
for
he
giveth
not
account
of
any
of
his
matters
for
god
speaketh
once
yea
twice
yet
man
perceiveth
it
not
in
a
dream
in
a
vision
of
the
night
when
deep
sleep
falleth
upon
men
in
slumberings
upon
the
bed
then
he
openeth
the
ears
of
men
and
sealeth
their
instruction
that
he
may
withdraw
man
from
his
purpose
and
hide
pride
from
man
he
keepeth
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
and
his
life
from
perishing
by
the
sword
he
is
chastened
also
with
pain
upon
his
bed
and
the
multitude
of
his
bones
with
strong
pain
so
that
his
life
abhorreth
bread
and
his
soul
dainty
meat
his
flesh
is
consumed
away
that
it
cannot
be
seen
and
his
bones
that
were
not
seen
stick
out
yea
his
soul
draweth
near
unto
the
grave
and
his
life
to
the
destroyers
if
there
be
a
messenger
with
him
an
interpreter
one
among
a
thousand
to
shew
unto
man
his
uprightness
then
he
is
gracious
unto
him
and
saith
deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
pit
i
have
found
a
ransom
his
flesh
shall
be
fresher
than
a
child's
he
shall
return
to
the
days
of
his
youth
he
shall
pray
unto
god
and
he
will
be
favourable
unto
him
and
he
shall
see
his
face
with
joy
for
he
will
render
unto
man
his
righteousness
he
looketh
upon
men
and
if
any
say
i
have
sinned
and
perverted
that
which
was
right
and
it
profited
me
not
he
will
deliver
his
soul
from
going
into
the
pit
and
his
life
shall
see
the
light
lo
all
these
things
worketh
god
oftentimes
with
man
to
bring
back
his
soul
from
the
pit
to
be
enlightened
with
the
light
of
the
living
mark
well
o
job
hearken
unto
me
hold
thy
peace
and
i
will
speak
if
thou
hast
anything
to
say
answer
me
speak
for
i
desire
to
justify
thee
if
not
hearken
unto
me
hold
thy
peace
and
i
shall
teach
thee
wisdom
furthermore
elihu
answered
and
said
hear
my
words
o
ye
wise
men
and
give
ear
unto
me
ye
that
have
knowledge
for
the
ear
trieth
words
as
the
mouth
tasteth
meat
let
us
choose
to
us
judgment
let
us
know
among
ourselves
what
is
good
for
job
hath
said
i
am
righteous
and
god
hath
taken
away
my
judgment
should
i
lie
against
my
right
my
wound
is
incurable
without
transgression
what
man
is
like
job
who
drinketh
up
scorning
like
water
which
goeth
in
company
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
and
walketh
with
wicked
men
for
he
hath
said
it
profiteth
a
man
nothing
that
he
should
delight
himself
with
god
therefore
hearken
unto
me
ye
men
of
understanding
far
be
it
from
god
that
he
should
do
wickedness
and
from
the
almighty
that
he
should
commit
iniquity
for
the
work
of
a
man
shall
he
render
unto
him
and
cause
every
man
to
find
according
to
his
ways
yea
surely
god
will
not
do
wickedly
neither
will
the
almighty
pervert
judgment
who
hath
given
him
a
charge
over
the
earth
or
who
hath
disposed
the
whole
world
if
he
set
his
heart
upon
man
if
he
gather
unto
himself
his
spirit
and
his
breath
all
flesh
shall
perish
together
and
man
shall
turn
again
unto
dust
if
now
thou
hast
understanding
hear
this
hearken
to
the
voice
of
my
words
shall
even
he
that
hateth
right
govern
and
wilt
thou
condemn
him
that
is
most
just
is
it
fit
to
say
to
a
king
thou
art
wicked
and
to
princes
ye
are
ungodly
how
much
less
to
him
that
accepteth
not
the
persons
of
princes
nor
regardeth
the
rich
more
than
the
poor
for
they
all
are
the
work
of
his
hands
in
a
moment
shall
they
die
and
the
people
shall
be
troubled
at
midnight
and
pass
away
and
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
without
hand
for
his
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
of
man
and
he
seeth
all
his
goings
there
is
no
darkness
nor
shadow
of
death
where
the
workers
of
iniquity
may
hide
themselves
for
he
will
not
lay
upon
man
more
than
right
that
he
should
enter
into
judgment
with
god
he
shall
break
in
pieces
mighty
men
without
number
and
set
others
in
their
stead
therefore
he
knoweth
their
works
and
he
overturneth
them
in
the
night
so
that
they
are
destroyed
he
striketh
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
others
because
they
turned
back
from
him
and
would
not
consider
any
of
his
ways
so
that
they
cause
the
cry
of
the
poor
to
come
unto
him
and
he
heareth
the
cry
of
the
afflicted
when
he
giveth
quietness
who
then
can
make
trouble
and
when
he
hideth
his
face
who
then
can
behold
him
whether
it
be
done
against
a
nation
or
against
a
man
only
that
the
hypocrite
reign
not
lest
the
people
be
ensnared
surely
it
is
meet
to
be
said
unto
god
i
have
borne
chastisement
i
will
not
offend
any
more
that
which
i
see
not
teach
thou
me
if
i
have
done
iniquity
i
will
do
no
more
should
it
be
according
to
thy
mind
he
will
recompense
it
whether
thou
refuse
or
whether
thou
choose
and
not
i
therefore
speak
what
thou
knowest
let
men
of
understanding
tell
me
and
let
a
wise
man
hearken
unto
me
job
hath
spoken
without
knowledge
and
his
words
were
without
wisdom
my
desire
is
that
job
may
be
tried
unto
the
end
because
of
his
answers
for
wicked
men
for
he
addeth
rebellion
unto
his
sin
he
clappeth
his
hands
among
us
and
multiplieth
his
words
against
god
elihu
spake
moreover
and
said
thinkest
thou
this
to
be
right
that
thou
saidst
my
righteousness
is
more
than
god's
for
thou
saidst
what
advantage
will
it
be
unto
thee
and
what
profit
shall
i
have
if
i
be
cleansed
from
my
sin
i
will
answer
thee
and
thy
companions
with
thee
look
unto
the
heavens
and
see
and
behold
the
clouds
which
are
higher
than
thou
if
thou
sinnest
what
doest
thou
against
him
or
if
thy
transgressions
be
multiplied
what
doest
thou
unto
him
if
thou
be
righteous
what
givest
thou
him
or
what
receiveth
he
of
thine
hand
thy
wickedness
may
hurt
a
man
as
thou
art
and
thy
righteousness
may
profit
the
son
of
man
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
oppressions
they
make
the
oppressed
to
cry
they
cry
out
by
reason
of
the
arm
of
the
mighty
but
none
saith
where
is
god
my
maker
who
giveth
songs
in
the
night
who
teacheth
us
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
maketh
us
wiser
than
the
fowls
of
heaven
there
they
cry
but
none
giveth
answer
because
of
the
pride
of
evil
men
surely
god
will
not
hear
vanity
neither
will
the
almighty
regard
it
although
thou
sayest
thou
shalt
not
see
him
yet
judgment
is
before
him
therefore
trust
thou
in
him
but
now
because
it
is
not
so
he
hath
visited
in
his
anger
yet
he
knoweth
it
not
in
great
extremity
therefore
doth
job
open
his
mouth
in
vain
he
multiplieth
words
without
knowledge
elihu
also
proceeded
and
said
suffer
me
a
little
and
i
will
shew
thee
that
i
have
yet
to
speak
on
god's
behalf
i
will
fetch
my
knowledge
from
afar
and
will
ascribe
righteousness
to
my
maker
for
truly
my
words
shall
not
be
false
he
that
is
perfect
in
knowledge
is
with
thee
behold
god
is
mighty
and
despiseth
not
any
he
is
mighty
in
strength
and
wisdom
he
preserveth
not
the
life
of
the
wicked
but
giveth
right
to
the
poor
he
withdraweth
not
his
eyes
from
the
righteous
but
with
kings
are
they
on
the
throne
yea
he
doth
establish
them
for
ever
and
they
are
exalted
and
if
they
be
bound
in
fetters
and
be
holden
in
cords
of
affliction
then
he
sheweth
them
their
work
and
their
transgressions
that
they
have
exceeded
he
openeth
also
their
ear
to
discipline
and
commandeth
that
they
return
from
iniquity
if
they
obey
and
serve
him
they
shall
spend
their
days
in
prosperity
and
their
years
in
pleasures
but
if
they
obey
not
they
shall
perish
by
the
sword
and
they
shall
die
without
knowledge
but
the
hypocrites
in
heart
heap
up
wrath
they
cry
not
when
he
bindeth
them
they
die
in
youth
and
their
life
is
among
the
unclean
he
delivereth
the
poor
in
his
affliction
and
openeth
their
ears
in
oppression
even
so
would
he
have
removed
thee
out
of
the
strait
into
a
broad
place
where
there
is
no
straitness
and
that
which
should
be
set
on
thy
table
should
be
full
of
fatness
but
thou
hast
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
wicked
judgment
and
justice
take
hold
on
thee
because
there
is
wrath
beware
lest
he
take
thee
away
with
his
stroke
then
a
great
ransom
cannot
deliver
thee
will
he
esteem
thy
riches
no
not
gold
nor
all
the
forces
of
strength
desire
not
the
night
when
people
are
cut
off
in
their
place
take
heed
regard
not
iniquity
for
this
hast
thou
chosen
rather
than
affliction
behold
god
exalteth
by
his
power
who
teacheth
like
him
who
hath
enjoined
him
his
way
or
who
can
say
thou
hast
wrought
iniquity
remember
that
thou
magnify
his
work
which
men
behold
every
man
may
see
it
man
may
behold
it
afar
off
behold
god
is
great
and
we
know
him
not
neither
can
the
number
of
his
years
be
searched
out
for
he
maketh
small
the
drops
of
water
they
pour
down
rain
according
to
the
vapour
thereof
which
the
clouds
do
drop
and
distil
upon
man
abundantly
also
can
any
understand
the
spreadings
of
the
clouds
or
the
noise
of
his
tabernacle
behold
he
spreadeth
his
light
upon
it
and
covereth
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
by
them
judgeth
he
the
people
he
giveth
meat
in
abundance
with
clouds
he
covereth
the
light
and
commandeth
it
not
to
shine
by
the
cloud
that
cometh
betwixt
the
noise
thereof
sheweth
concerning
it
the
cattle
also
concerning
the
vapour
at
this
also
my
heart
trembleth
and
is
moved
out
of
his
place
hear
attentively
the
noise
of
his
voice
and
the
sound
that
goeth
out
of
his
mouth
he
directeth
it
under
the
whole
heaven
and
his
lightning
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
after
it
a
voice
roareth
he
thundereth
with
the
voice
of
his
excellency
and
he
will
not
stay
them
when
his
voice
is
heard
god
thundereth
marvellously
with
his
voice
great
things
doeth
he
which
we
cannot
comprehend
for
he
saith
to
the
snow
be
thou
on
the
earth
likewise
to
the
small
rain
and
to
the
great
rain
of
his
strength
he
sealeth
up
the
hand
of
every
man
that
all
men
may
know
his
work
then
the
beasts
go
into
dens
and
remain
in
their
places
out
of
the
south
cometh
the
whirlwind
and
cold
out
of
the
north
by
the
breath
of
god
frost
is
given
and
the
breadth
of
the
waters
is
straitened
also
by
watering
he
wearieth
the
thick
cloud
he
scattereth
his
bright
cloud
and
it
is
turned
round
about
by
his
counsels
that
they
may
do
whatsoever
he
commandeth
them
upon
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
earth
he
causeth
it
to
come
whether
for
correction
or
for
his
land
or
for
mercy
hearken
unto
this
o
job
stand
still
and
consider
the
wondrous
works
of
god
dost
thou
know
when
god
disposed
them
and
caused
the
light
of
his
cloud
to
shine
dost
thou
know
the
balancings
of
the
clouds
the
wondrous
works
of
him
which
is
perfect
in
knowledge
how
thy
garments
are
warm
when
he
quieteth
the
earth
by
the
south
wind
hast
thou
with
him
spread
out
the
sky
which
is
strong
and
as
a
molten
looking
glass
teach
us
what
we
shall
say
unto
him
for
we
cannot
order
our
speech
by
reason
of
darkness
shall
it
be
told
him
that
i
speak
if
a
man
speak
surely
he
shall
be
swallowed
up
and
now
men
see
not
the
bright
light
which
is
in
the
clouds
but
the
wind
passeth
and
cleanseth
them
fair
weather
cometh
out
of
the
north
with
god
is
terrible
majesty
touching
the
almighty
we
cannot
find
him
out
he
is
excellent
in
power
and
in
judgment
and
in
plenty
of
justice
he
will
not
afflict
men
do
therefore
fear
him
he
respecteth
not
any
that
are
wise
of
heart
then
the
lord
answered
job
out
of
the
whirlwind
and
said
who
is
this
that
darkeneth
counsel
by
words
without
knowledge
gird
up
now
thy
loins
like
a
man
for
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
answer
thou
me
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
declare
if
thou
hast
understanding
who
hath
laid
the
measures
thereof
if
thou
knowest
or
who
hath
stretched
the
line
upon
it
whereupon
are
the
foundations
thereof
fastened
or
who
laid
the
corner
stone
thereof
when
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
or
who
shut
up
the
sea
with
doors
when
it
brake
forth
as
if
it
had
issued
out
of
the
womb
when
i
made
the
cloud
the
garment
thereof
and
thick
darkness
a
swaddlingband
for
it
and
brake
up
for
it
my
decreed
place
and
set
bars
and
doors
and
said
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
but
no
further
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
hast
thou
commanded
the
morning
since
thy
days
and
caused
the
dayspring
to
know
his
place
that
it
might
take
hold
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
that
the
wicked
might
be
shaken
out
of
it
it
is
turned
as
clay
to
the
seal
and
they
stand
as
a
garment
and
from
the
wicked
their
light
is
withholden
and
the
high
arm
shall
be
broken
hast
thou
entered
into
the
springs
of
the
sea
or
hast
thou
walked
in
the
search
of
the
depth
have
the
gates
of
death
been
opened
unto
thee
or
hast
thou
seen
the
doors
of
the
shadow
of
death
hast
thou
perceived
the
breadth
of
the
earth
declare
if
thou
knowest
it
all
where
is
the
way
where
light
dwelleth
and
as
for
darkness
where
is
the
place
thereof
that
thou
shouldest
take
it
to
the
bound
thereof
and
that
thou
shouldest
know
the
paths
to
the
house
thereof
knowest
thou
it
because
thou
wast
then
born
or
because
the
number
of
thy
days
is
great
hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
snow
or
hast
thou
seen
the
treasures
of
the
hail
which
i
have
reserved
against
the
time
of
trouble
against
the
day
of
battle
and
war
by
what
way
is
the
light
parted
which
scattereth
the
east
wind
upon
the
earth
who
hath
divided
a
watercourse
for
the
overflowing
of
waters
or
a
way
for
the
lightning
of
thunder
to
cause
it
to

on
the

where
no

him
that

thy

she

smelleth
the

sinews
of
his
stones
are
wrapped
together
his
bones

strong
pieces
of
brass
his
bones

iron
he
is
the
chief
of

with
a
cord
which
thou
lettest
down
canst
thou
put
an
hook
into
his
nose
or
bore
his
jaw
through
with
a
thorn
will
he
make
many
supplications
unto
thee
will
he
speak
soft
words
unto
thee
will
he
make
a
covenant
with
thee
wilt
thou
take
him
for
a

thou
play
with
him
as

who

prevented
me
that

whatsoever

i
will
not
conceal
his
parts
nor
his

nor
his
comely
proportion
who
can
discover
the
face
of
his
garment
or
who
can
come
to
him
with
his
double
bridle
who
can
open
the
doors
of
his
face
his
teeth
are
terrible
round
about
his
scales
are
his
pride
shut
up
together
as
with
a
close
seal
one
is
so
near
to
another
that
no
air
can
come
between
them
they
are
joined
one
to
another
they
stick
together
that
they
cannot
be
sundered
by
his
neesings
a
light
doth
shine
and
his
eyes
are
like
the
eyelids
of
the
morning
out
of
his
mouth
go
burning
lamps
and
sparks
of
fire
leap
out
out
of
his
nostrils
goeth
smoke
as
out
of
a
seething
pot
or
caldron
his
breath
kindleth
coals
and
a
flame
goeth
out
of
his
mouth
in
his
neck
remaineth
strength
and
sorrow
is
turned
into
joy
before
him
the
flakes
of
his
flesh
are
joined
together
they
are
firm
in
themselves
they
cannot
be
moved
his
heart
is
as
firm
as
a
stone
yea
as
hard
as
a
piece
of
the
nether
millstone
when
he
raiseth
up
himself
the
mighty
are
afraid
by
reason
of
breakings
they
purify
themselves
the
sword
of
him
that
layeth
at
him
cannot
hold
the
spear
the
dart
nor
the
habergeon
he
esteemeth
iron
as
straw
and
brass
as
rotten
wood
the
arrow
cannot
make
him
flee
slingstones
are
turned
with
him
into
stubble
darts
are
counted
as
stubble
he
laugheth
at
the
shaking
of
a
spear
sharp
stones
are
under
him
he
spreadeth
sharp
pointed
things
upon
the
mire
he
maketh
the
deep
to
boil
like
a
pot
he
maketh
the
sea
like
a
pot
of
ointment
he
maketh
a
path
to
shine
after
him
one
would
think
the
deep
to
be
hoary
upon
earth
there
is
not
his
like
who
is
made
without
fear
he
beholdeth
all
high
things
he
is
a
king
over
all
the
children
of
pride
then
job
answered
the
lord
and
said
i
know
that
thou
canst
do
every
thing
and
that
no
thought
can
be
withholden
from
thee
who
is
he
that
hideth
counsel
without
knowledge
therefore
have
i
uttered
that
i
understood
not
things
too
wonderful
for
me
which
i
knew
not
hear
i
beseech
thee
and
i
will
speak
i
will
demand
of
thee
and
declare
thou
unto
me
i
have
heard
of
thee
by
the
hearing
of
the
ear
but
now
mine
eye
seeth
thee
wherefore
i
abhor
myself
and
repent
in
dust
and
ashes
and
it
was
so
that
after
the
lord
had
spoken
these
words
unto
job
the
lord
said
to
eliphaz
the
temanite
my
wrath
is
kindled
against
thee
and
against
thy
two
friends
for
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
that
is
right
as
my
servant
job
hath
therefore
take
unto
you
now
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
and
go
to
my
servant
job
and
offer
up
for
yourselves
a
burnt
offering
and
my
servant
job
shall
pray
for
you
for
him
will
i
accept
lest
i
deal
with
you
after
your
folly
in
that
ye
have
not
spoken
of
me
the
thing
which
is
right
like
my
servant
job
so
eliphaz
the
temanite
and
bildad
the
shuhite
and
zophar
the
naamathite
went
and
did
according
as
the
lord
commanded
them
the
lord
also
accepted
job
and
the
lord
turned
the
captivity
of
job
when
he
prayed
for
his
friends
also
the
lord
gave
job
twice
as
much
as
he
had
before
then
came
there
unto
him
all
his
brethren
and
all
his
sisters
and
all
they
that
had
been
of
his
acquaintance
before
and
did
eat
bread
with
him
in
his
house
and
they
bemoaned
him
and
comforted
him
over
all
the
evil
that
the
lord
had
brought
upon
him
every
man
also
gave
him
a
piece
of
money
and
every
one
an
earring
of
gold
so
the
lord
blessed
the
latter
end
of
job
more
than
his
beginning
for
he
had
fourteen
thousand
sheep
and
six
thousand
camels
and
a
thousand
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
thousand
she
asses
he
had
also
seven
sons
and
three
daughters
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
first
jemima
and
the
name
of
the
second
kezia
and
the
name
of
the
third
kerenhappuch
and
in
all
the
land
were
no
women
found
so
fair
as
the
daughters
of
job
and
their
father
gave
them
inheritance
among
their
brethren
after
this
lived
job
an
hundred
and
forty
years
and
saw
his
sons
and
his
sons
sons
even
four
generations
so
job
died
being
old
and
full
of
days
the
book
of
psalms
blessed
is
the
man
that
walketh
not
in
the
counsel
of
the
ungodly
nor
standeth
in
the
way
of
sinners
nor
sitteth
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful
but
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
the
lord
and
in
his
law
doth
he
meditate
day
and
night
and
he
shall
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
that
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
season
his
leaf
also
shall
not
wither
and
whatsoever
he
doeth
shall
prosper
the
ungodly
are
not
so
but
are
like
the
chaff
which
the
wind
driveth
away
therefore
the
ungodly
shall
not
stand
in
the
judgment
nor
sinners
in
the
congregation
of
the
righteous
for
the
lord
knoweth
the
way
of
the
righteous
but
the
way
of
the
ungodly
shall
perish
why
do
the
heathen
rage
and
the
people
imagine
a
vain
thing
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
saying
let
us
break
their
bands
asunder
and
cast
away
their
cords
from
us
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
then
shall
he
speak
unto
them
in
his
wrath
and
vex
them
in
his
sore
displeasure
yet
have
i
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
zion
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ask
of
me
and
i
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession
thou
shalt
break
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
thou
shalt
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter's
vessel
be
wise
now
therefore
o
ye
kings
be
instructed
ye
judges
of
the
earth
serve
the
lord
with
fear
and
rejoice
with
trembling
kiss
the
son
lest
he
be
angry
and
ye
perish
from
the
way
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
little
blessed
are
all
they
that
put
their
trust
in
him
lord
how
are
they
increased
that
trouble
me
many
are
they
that
rise
up
against
me
many
there
be
which
say
of
my
soul
there
is
no
help
for
him
in
god
selah
but
thou
o
lord
art
a
shield
for
me
my
glory
and
the
lifter
up
of
mine
head
i
cried
unto
the
lord
with
my
voice
and
he
heard
me
out
of
his
holy
hill
selah
i
laid
me
down
and
slept
i
awaked
for
the
lord
sustained
me
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
ten
thousands
of
people
that
have
set
themselves
against
me
round
about
arise
o
lord
save
me
o
my
god
for
thou
hast
smitten
all
mine
enemies
upon
the
cheek

thou
hast
broken
the
teeth
of
the
ungodly
salvation
belongeth
unto
the
lord
thy
blessing
is
upon
thy
people
selah
hear
me
when
i
call
o
god
of
my
righteousness
thou
hast
enlarged
me
when
i
was
in
distress
have

upon
me
and
hear
my
prayer
o
ye
sons
of
men
how
long
will
ye
turn
my
glory
into
shame
how
long
will
ye
love
vanity
and
seek
after
leasing
selah
but
know
that
the
lord
hath
set
apart
him
that
is
godly
for
himself
the
lord
will
hear
when
i
call
unto
him
stand
in
awe
and
sin
not
commune
with
your
own
heart
upon
your
bed
and
be
still
selah
offer
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
and
put
your
trust
in
the
lord
there
be
many
that
say
who
will
shew
us
any
good
lord
lift
thou
up
the
light
of
thy
countenance
upon
us
thou
hast
put
gladness
in
my
heart
more
than
in
the
time
that
their
corn
and
their
wine
increased
i
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
thou
lord
only
makest
me

to
my
words

i
pray
my
voice
shalt
thou
hear
in
the
morning
o
lord
in
the
morning
will
i
direct
my
prayer
unto
thee
and
will
look
up
for
thou
art
not
a
god
that
hath
pleasure
in
wickedness
neither
shall
evil
dwell
with
thee
the
foolish
shall
not
stand
in
thy
sight
thou
hatest
all
workers
of
iniquity
thou
shalt
destroy
them
that
speak
leasing
the
lord
will
abhor
the
bloody
and
deceitful
man
but
as
for
me
i
will
come
into
thy
house
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
and
in
thy
fear
will
i
worship
toward
thy
holy
temple
lead
me
o
lord
in
thy
righteousness
because
of
mine
enemies
make
thy
way
straight
before
my
face
for
there
is
no
faithfulness
in
their
mouth
their
inward
part
is
very
wickedness
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre
they
flatter
with
their
tongue
destroy
thou
them
o
god
let
them
fall
by
their
own
counsels
cast
them
out
in
the
multitude
of
their
transgressions
for
they
have
rebelled
against
thee
but

all
those
that

in
thee
rejoice

them
ever
shout
for
joy

defendest
them

also
that

joyful
in
thee

thou
compass
him
as

me
not
in
thine
anger
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure

upon
me

have
said
with
our
tongue
will
we
prevail
our

our

over
us
for
the
oppression
of
the
poor
for
the
sighing
of
the
needy
now
will
i
arise
saith
the
lord
i
will
set
him
in
safety
from
him
that

pure
words
as

furnace
of
earth
purified
seven
times
thou
shalt
keep
them
o
lord
thou
shalt
preserve
them
from
this
generation
for
ever
the
wicked
walk
on
every
side
when
the
vilest
men
are
exalted
how
long
wilt
thou
forget
me
o
lord
for
ever
how
long
wilt
thou
hide
thy
face
from
me
how
long
shall
i
take
counsel
in
my
soul
having
sorrow
in
my
heart
daily
how

me
o

my
god

mine
eyes
lest
i

sleep
of

children
of
men
to
see
if
there
were
any
that

in
great
fear
for
god
is
in
the
generation
of
the
righteous
ye
have
shamed

is
his
refuge
oh

out
of
zion
when
the
lord
bringeth
back

glad
lord
who
shall
abide
in
thy

in
thy
holy
hill
he
that
walketh
uprightly
and
worketh
righteousness
and
speaketh
the
truth
in

evil
to
his
neighbour
nor
taketh
up
a
reproach
against
his
neighbour
in

a
vile
person
is
contemned

not
he
that

proved
mine
heart
thou
hast
visited
me
in
the
night
thou
hast
tried
me
and
shalt
find
nothing
i
am
purposed
that
my
mouth
shall
not
transgress
concerning
the
works
of
men
by
the
word
of
thy
lips
i
have
kept
me
from
the
paths
of
the
destroyer
hold
up
my
goings
in
thy
paths
that
my
footsteps
slip
not
i
have
called
upon
thee
for
thou
wilt
hear
me
o
god
incline
thine
ear
unto
me
and
hear
my
speech
shew
thy
marvellous
lovingkindness
o
thou

savest
by
thy
right
hand

their
trust
in
thee
from
those
that

up
against
them

me
as
the
apple
of
the
eye

me
under
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
from
the
wicked
that
oppress
me
from
my
deadly
enemies
who
compass
me
about
they
are
inclosed
in
their
own
fat
with
their
mouth
they
speak
proudly
they
have
now
compassed
us
in
our
steps
they
have
set
their
eyes
bowing
down
to
the
earth
like
as
a
lion
that
is
greedy
of
his
prey
and
as
it
were
a
young
lion
lurking
in
secret
places
arise
o
lord
disappoint
him
cast
him
down
deliver
my
soul
from
the
wicked
which
is
thy
sword
from
men
which
are
thy
hand
o
lord
from
men
of
the
world
which
have
their
portion
in
this
life
and
whose
belly
thou
fillest
with
thy
hid
treasure
they
are
full
of
children
and
leave
the
rest
of
their
substance
to
their
babes
as
for
me
i
will
behold
thy
face
in
righteousness
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
likeness
i
will
love
thee
o
lord
my
strength
the
lord
is
my
rock
and
my
fortress
and
my
deliverer
my
god
my
strength
in
whom
i
will
trust
my
buckler
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation
and
my
high
tower
i
will
call
upon
the
lord
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised
so
shall
i
be
saved
from
mine
enemies
the
sorrows
of
death
compassed
me
and
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid
the
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
and
cried
unto
my
god
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
came
before
him
even
into
his
ears
then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
the
foundations
also
of
the
hills
moved
and
were
shaken
because
he
was
wroth
there
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured
coals
were
kindled
by
it
he
bowed
the
heavens
also
and
came
down
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet
and
he
rode
upon
a
cherub
and
did
fly
yea
he
did
fly
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
he
made
darkness
his
secret
place
his
pavilion
round
about
him
were
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
at
the
brightness
that
was
before
him
his
thick
clouds
passed
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire
the
lord
also
thundered
in
the
heavens
and
the
highest
gave
his
voice
hail
stones
and
coals
of
fire
yea
he
sent
out
his
arrows
and
scattered
them
and
he
shot
out
lightnings
and
discomfited
them
then
the
channels
of
waters
were
seen
and
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered
at
thy
rebuke
o
lord
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
thy
nostrils
he
sent
from
above
he
took
me
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters
he
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy
and
from
them
which
hated
me
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me
they
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity
but
the
lord
was
my
stay
he
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place
he
delivered
me
because
he
delighted
in
me
the
lord
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me
for
i
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
god
for
all
his
judgments
were
before
me
and
i
did
not
put
away
his
statutes
from
me
i
was
also
upright
before
him
and
i
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity
therefore
hath
the
lord
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
in
his
eyesight
with
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful
with
an
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright
with
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
froward
for
thou
wilt
save
the
afflicted
people
but
wilt
bring
down
high
looks
for
thou
wilt
light
my
candle
the
lord
my
god
will
enlighten
my
darkness
for
by
thee
i
have
run
through
a
troop
and
by
my
god
have
i
leaped
over
a
wall
as
for
god
his
way
is
perfect
the
word
of
the
lord
is
tried
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
those
that
trust
in
him
for
who
is
god
save
the
lord
or
who
is
a
rock
save
our
god
it
is
god
that
girdeth
me
with
strength
and
maketh
my
way
perfect
he
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds
feet
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places
he
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation
and
thy
right
hand
hath
holden
me
up
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great
thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me
that
my
feet
did
not
slip
i
have
pursued
mine
enemies
and
overtaken
them
neither
did
i
turn
again
till
they
were
consumed
i
have
wounded
them
that
they
were
not
able
to
rise
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet
for
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
unto
the
battle
thou
hast
subdued
under
me
those
that
rose
up
against
me
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies
that
i
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me
they
cried
but
there
was
none
to
save
them
even
unto
the
lord
but
he
answered
them
not
then
did
i
beat
them
small
as
the
dust
before
the
wind
i
did
cast
them
out
as
the
dirt
in
the
streets
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
the
people
and
thou
hast
made
me
the
head
of
the
heathen
a
people
whom
i
have
not
known
shall
serve
me
as
soon
as
they
hear
of
me
they
shall
obey
me
the
strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me
the
strangers
shall
fade
away
and
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places
the
lord
liveth
and
blessed
be
my
rock
and
let
the
god
of
my
salvation
be
exalted
it
is
god
that
avengeth
me
and
subdueth
the
people
under
me
he
delivereth
me
from
mine
enemies
yea
thou
liftest
me
up
above
those
that
rise
up
against
me
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man
therefore
will
i
give
thanks
unto
thee
o
lord
among
the
heathen
and
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
great
deliverance
giveth
he
to
his
king
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed
to
david
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
sheweth
his
handywork
day
unto
day
uttereth
speech
and
night
unto
night
sheweth
knowledge
there
is
no
speech
nor
language
where
their
voice
is
not
heard
their
line
is
gone
out
through
all
the
earth
and
their
words
to
the
end
of
the
world
in
them
hath
he
set
a
tabernacle
for
the
sun
which
is
as
a
bridegroom
coming
out
of
his
chamber
and
rejoiceth
as
a
strong
man
to
run
a
race
his
going
forth
is
from
the
end
of
the
heaven
and
his
circuit
unto
the
ends
of
it
and
there
is
nothing
hid
from
the
heat
thereof
the
law
of
the
lord
is
perfect
converting
the
soul
the
testimony
of
the
lord
is
sure
making
wise

statutes
of
the
lord

commandment
of
the
lord

fear
of
the
lord

for
ever
the
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
more
to
be
desired
are
they
than
gold
yea
than
much
fine
gold
sweeter
also
than
honey
and
the
honeycomb
moreover
by
them
is
thy
servant
warned
and
in
keeping
of
them
there
is
great
reward
who
can
understand
his
errors

me
from
secret
faults

back
thy
servant

from
presumptuous
sins

given
him
his
heart's

him
with
the
blessings
of
goodness
thou
settest
a
crown
of
pure
gold
on
his

asked
life
of
thee
and
thou
gavest

of
days
for
ever
and

exceeding
glad

thy
countenance

mercy
of
the
most
high
he
shall
not
be
moved
thine
hand
shall
find
out
all
thine
enemies
thy
right
hand
shall
find
out
those
that
hate
thee
thou
shalt
make
them
as
a
fiery
oven
in
the
time
of
thine
anger
the
lord
shall
swallow
them
up
in
his
wrath
and
the
fire
shall
devour
them
their
fruit
shalt
thou
destroy
from
the
earth
and
their
seed
from
among
the
children
of
men
for
they
intended
evil
against
thee
they
imagined
a
mischievous
device
which
they
are
not
able
to
perform
therefore
shalt
thou
make
them
turn
their
back
when
thou
shalt
make
ready
thine
arrows
upon
thy
strings
against
the
face
of
them
be
thou
exalted
lord
in
thine
own
strength
so
will
we
sing
and
praise
thy
power
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
why
art
thou
so
far
from
helping
me
and
from
the
words
of
my
roaring
o
my
god
i
cry
in
the
day
time
but
thou
hearest
not
and
in
the
night
season
and
am
not
silent
but
thou
art
holy
o
thou
that
inhabitest
the
praises
of
israel
our
fathers
trusted
in
thee
they
trusted
and
thou
didst
deliver
them
they
cried
unto
thee
and
were
delivered
they
trusted
in
thee
and
were
not
confounded
but
i
am
a
worm
and
no
man
a
reproach
of
men
and
despised
of
the
people
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out
the
lip
they
shake
the
head
saying
he
trusted
on
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
let
him
deliver
him
seeing
he
delighted
in
him
but
thou
art
he
that
took
me
out
of

in

time
of

he
shall
hide
me
in
his
pavilion
in
the
secret
of
his

shall
he
hide

shall
set
me
up
upon
a
rock
and
now
shall
mine
head
be
lifted
up
above
mine
enemies
round
about
me
therefore

i
offer
in

tabernacle
sacrifices
of
joy

praises
unto
the

not
neither
forsake
me
o
god
of
my
salvation

me
then
the
lord

take
me
up

me
thy
way
o

me
not
away

and
according
to
the
wickedness
of
their
endeavours

them
after

render
to
them
their
desert
because
they
regard
not
the
works
of
the
lord
nor
the
operation
of
his
hands
he
shall
destroy
them
and
not
build
them
up

hath
heard
the
voice
of
my
supplications

consumed
i
was
a
reproach
among

to
mine
acquaintance
they
that

grievous
things
proudly
and
contemptuously
against
the
righteous
oh
how
great
is
thy
goodness
which
thou
hast
laid
up
for
them
that
fear
thee
which
thou

wrought
for
them
that

in
thee
before
the
sons
of
men
thou
shalt
hide
them
in
the
secret
of
thy
presence
from
the
pride
of
man
thou
shalt
keep
them
secretly
in
a
pavilion
from
the
strife
of
tongues
blessed

the
lord
for
he
hath
shewed
me
his
marvellous
kindness
in
a
strong
city

off
from
before

the
voice
of
my
supplications
when
i

unto
thee
o

been
my
friend
or

i
bowed
down

as
one
that
mourneth
for
his

deceitful
matters
against
them
that
are
quiet
in
the
land
yea

opened
their
mouth
wide
against

wicked
saith
within
my
heart
that

himself
in
his

words
of
his
mouth
are
iniquity

shall
be
abundantly
satisfied
with
the
fatness
of
thy
house

of
the
river
of
thy
pleasures

is
before
thee
and
my
groaning
is
not

sore
and

kinsmen
stand
afar
off

after
my

lay
snares
for
me
and
they
that
seek
my
hurt
speak
mischievous
things
and
imagine
deceits
all
the
day
long
but
i
as
a
deaf
man
heard
not
and
i
was
as
a
dumb
man
that
openeth
not
his
mouth
thus
i
was
as
a
man
that
heareth
not
and
in
whose
mouth
are
no
reproofs
for
in
thee
o
lord
do
i
hope
thou
wilt
hear
o
lord
my
god
for
i
said
hear
me
lest
otherwise
they
should
rejoice
over
me
when
my
foot
slippeth
they
magnify
themselves
against
me
for
i
am
ready
to
halt
and
my
sorrow
is
continually
before
me
for
i
will
declare
mine
iniquity
i
will
be
sorry
for
my
sin
but
mine
enemies
are
lively
and
they
are
strong
and
they
that
hate
me
wrongfully
are
multiplied
they
also
that
render
evil
for
good
are
mine
adversaries
because
i
follow
the
thing
that
good
is
forsake
me
not
o
lord
o
my
god
be
not
far
from
me
make
haste
to
help
me
o
lord
my
salvation
i
said
i
will
take
heed
to
my
ways
that
i
sin
not
with
my
tongue
i
will
keep
my
mouth
with
a
bridle
while
the
wicked
is
before
me
i
was
dumb
with
silence
i
held
my
peace
even
from
good
and
my
sorrow
was
stirred
my
heart
was
hot
within
me
while
i
was
musing
the
fire
burned
then
spake
i
with
my
tongue
lord
make
me
to
know
mine
end
and
the
measure
of
my
days
what
it
is
that
i
may
know
how
frail
i
am
behold
thou
hast
made
my
days
as
an
handbreadth
and
mine
age
is
as
nothing
before
thee
verily
every
man
at
his
best
state
is
altogether
vanity
selah
surely
every
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shew
surely
they
are
disquieted
in
vain
he
heapeth
up
riches
and
knoweth
not
who
shall
gather
them
and
now
lord
what
wait
i
for
my
hope
is
in
thee
deliver
me
from
all
my
transgressions
make
me
not
the
reproach
of
the
foolish
i
was
dumb
i
opened
not
my
mouth
because
thou
didst
it
remove
thy
stroke
away
from
me
i
am
consumed
by
the
blow
of
thine
hand
when
thou
with
rebukes
dost
correct
man
for
iniquity
thou
makest
his
beauty
to
consume
away
like
a
moth
surely
every
man
is
vanity
selah
hear
my
prayer
o
lord
and
give
ear
unto
my
cry
hold
not
thy
peace
at
my
tears
for
i
am
a
stranger
with
thee
and
a
sojourner
as
all
my
fathers
were
o
spare
me
that
i
may
recover
strength
before
i
go
hence
and
be
no
more
i
waited
patiently
for
the
lord
and
he
inclined
unto
me
and
heard
my
cry
he
brought
me
up
also
out
of
an
horrible
pit
out
of
the
miry
clay
and
set
my
feet
upon
a
rock
and
established
my
goings
and
he
hath
put
a
new
song
in
my
mouth
even
praise
unto
our
god
many
shall
see
it
and
fear
and
shall
trust
in
the
lord
blessed
is
that
man
that
maketh
the
lord
his
trust
and
respecteth
not
the
proud
nor
such
as
turn
aside
to
lies
many
o
lord
my
god
are
thy
wonderful
works
which
thou
hast
done
and
thy
thoughts
which
are
to
us-ward
they
cannot
be
reckoned
up
in
order
unto
thee
if
i
would
declare
and
speak
of
them
they
are
more
than
can
be
numbered
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
didst
not
desire
mine
ears
hast
thou
opened
burnt
offering
and
sin
offering
hast
thou
not
required
then
said
i
lo
i
come
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
o
my
god
yea
thy
law
is
within
my
heart
i
have
preached
righteousness
in
the
great
congregation
lo
i
have
not
refrained
my
lips
o
lord
thou
knowest
i
have
not
hid
thy
righteousness
within
my
heart
i
have
declared
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
salvation
i
have
not
concealed
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
from
the
great
congregation
withhold
not
thou
thy
tender
mercies
from
me
o
lord
let
thy
lovingkindness
and
thy
truth
continually
preserve
me
for
innumerable
evils
have
compassed
me
about
mine
iniquities
have
taken
hold
upon
me
so
that
i
am
not
able
to
look
up
they
are
more
than
the
hairs
of
mine
head
therefore
my
heart
faileth
me
be
pleased
o
lord
to
deliver
me
o
lord
make
haste
to
help
me
let
them
be
ashamed
and
confounded
together
that

after
my
soul
to
destroy
it
let
them
be
driven
backward
and
put
to
shame
that
wish
me
evil
let
them
be
desolate
for
a
reward
of
their
shame
that
say
unto
me
aha
aha
let
all
those
that
seek
thee
rejoice
and
be
glad
in
thee
let
such
as
love
thy
salvation
say
continually
the
lord
be
magnified
but
i
am
poor
and
needy
yet
the
lord
thinketh
upon
me
thou
art
my
help
and
my
deliverer
make
no
tarrying
o
my
god
blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
poor
the
lord

deliver
him
in
time
of
trouble
the
lord
will
preserve
him
and
keep
him
alive
and
he
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
earth
and
thou
wilt
not
deliver
him
unto
the
will
of
his
enemies
the
lord
will
strengthen
him
upon
the
bed
of
languishing
thou
wilt
make
all
his
bed
in
his
sickness
i
said
lord

me

my
soul
for
i
have
sinned
against
thee
mine
enemies
speak
evil
of
me
when
shall
he
die
and
his
name
perish
and
if
he
come
to
see
me
he
speaketh
vanity
his
heart
gathereth
iniquity
to
itself
when
he
goeth
abroad
he
telleth
it
all
that

together
against

shall
rise
up
no
more
yea
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
but
thou
o
lord
be
merciful
unto
me
and
raise
me
up
that
i
may
requite
them
by
this
i
know
that
thou
favourest
me
because
mine
enemy
doth
not
triumph
over
me
and
as
for
me

upholdest
me
in
mine
integrity

we
have
heard
with
our
ears
o
god
our
fathers
have
told
us
what
work
thou
didst
in
their
days
in
the
times
of
old
how
thou
didst
drive
out
the
heathen
with
thy
hand
and
plantedst
them
how
thou
didst
afflict
the
people
and
cast
them
out
for
they
got
not
the
land
in
possession
by
their
own
sword
neither
did
their
own
arm
save
them
but
thy
right
hand
and
thine
arm
and
the
light
of
thy
countenance
because
thou
hadst
a
favour
unto
them
thou
art
my
king
o
god
command
deliverances
for
jacob
through
thee
will
we
push
down
our
enemies
through
thy
name
will
we
tread
them
under
that
rise
up
against
us
for
i
will
not
trust
in
my
bow
neither
shall
my
sword
save
me
but
thou
hast
saved
us
from
our
enemies
and
hast
put
them
to
shame
that
hated
us
in
god
we
boast
all
the
day
long
and
praise
thy
name
for
ever
selah
but
thou
hast
cast
off
and
put
us
to
shame
and
goest
not
forth
with
our
armies
thou
makest
us
to
turn
back
from
the
enemy
and
they
which
hate
us
spoil
for
themselves
thou
hast
given
us
like
sheep
appointed
for
meat
and
hast
scattered
us
among
the
heathen
thou
sellest
thy
people
for
nought
and
dost
not
increase
thy
wealth
by
their
price
thou
makest
us
a
reproach
to
our
neighbours
a
scorn
and
a
derision
to
them
that
are
round
about
us
thou
makest
us
a
byword
among
the
heathen
a
shaking
of
the
head
among
the
people
my
confusion
is
continually
before
me
and
the
shame
of
my
face
hath
covered
me
for
the
voice
of
him
that
reproacheth
and
blasphemeth
by
reason
of
the
enemy
and
avenger
all
this
is
come
upon
us
yet
have
we
not
forgotten
thee
neither
have
we
dealt
falsely
in
thy
covenant
our
heart
is
not
turned
back
neither
have
our
steps
declined
from
thy
way
though
thou
hast
sore
broken
us
in
the
place
of
dragons
and
covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
death
if
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our
god
or
stretched
out
our
hands
to
a
strange
god
shall
not
god
search
this
out
for
he
knoweth
the
secrets
of
the
heart
yea
for
thy
sake
are
we
killed
all
the
day
long
we
are
counted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
awake
why
sleepest
thou
o
lord
arise
cast
us
not
off
for
ever
wherefore
hidest
thou
thy
face
and
forgettest
our
affliction
and
our
oppression
for
our
soul
is
bowed
down
to
the
dust
our
belly
cleaveth
unto
the
earth
arise
for
our
help
and
redeem
us
for
thy
mercies

heart
is
inditing
a
good
matter

and
meekness
and
righteousness
and
thy
right
hand
shall
teach
thee
terrible
things
thine
arrows
are
sharp
in
the
heart
of
the

hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows

thy
garments

of
myrrh

god
god
will
establish
it
for
ever
selah
we
have
thought
of
thy
lovingkindness
o
god
in
the
midst
of
thy
temple
according
to
thy
name
o
god
so
is
thy
praise
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
thy
right
hand
is
full
of
righteousness
let
mount
zion
rejoice
let
the
daughters
of
judah
be
glad
because
of
thy
judgments
walk
about
zion
and
go
round
about
her
tell
the
towers
thereof
mark
ye
well
her
bulwarks
consider
her
palaces
that
ye
may
tell
it
to
the
generation
following
for
this
god
is
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
he
will
be
our
guide
even
unto
death
hear
this
all
ye
people
give
ear
all
ye
inhabitants
of
the
world
both
low
and
high
rich
and
poor
together
my
mouth
shall
speak
of
wisdom
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart
shall
be
of
understanding
i
will
incline
mine
ear
to
a
parable
i
will
open
my
dark
saying
upon
the
harp
wherefore
should
i
fear
in
the
days
of
evil
when
the
iniquity
of
my
heels
shall
compass
me
about
they
that
trust
in
their
wealth
and
boast
themselves
in
the
multitude
of
their
riches
none
of
them
can
by
any
means
redeem
his
brother
nor
give
to
god
a
ransom
for
him
for
the
redemption
of
their
soul
is
precious
and
it
ceaseth
for
ever
that
he
should
still
live
for
ever
and
not
see
corruption
for
he
seeth
that
wise
men
die
likewise
the
fool
and
the
brutish
person
perish
and
leave
their
wealth
to
others
their
inward
thought
is
that
their
houses
shall
continue
for
ever
and
their
dwelling
places
to
all
generations
they
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names
nevertheless
man
being
in
honour
abideth
not
he
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish
this
their
way
is
their
folly
yet
their
posterity
approve
their
sayings
selah
like
sheep
they
are
laid
in
the
grave
death
shall
feed
on
them
and
the
upright
shall
have
dominion
over
them
in
the
morning
and
their
beauty
shall
consume
in
the
grave
from
their
dwelling
but
god
will
redeem
my
soul
from
the
power
of
the
grave
for
he
shall
receive
me
selah
be
not
thou
afraid
when
one
is
made
rich
when
the
glory
of
his
house
is
increased
for
when
he
dieth
he
shall
carry
nothing
away
his
glory
shall
not
descend
after
him
though
while
he
lived
he
blessed
his
soul
and
men
will
praise
thee
when
thou
doest
well
to
thyself
he
shall
go
to
the
generation
of
his
fathers
they
shall
never
see
light
man
that
is
in
honour
and
understandeth
not
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish
the
mighty
god
even
the
lord
hath
spoken
and
called
the
earth
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
going
down
thereof
out
of
zion
the
perfection
of
beauty
god
hath
shined
our
god
shall
come
and
shall
not
keep
silence
a
fire
shall
devour
before
him
and
it
shall
be
very
tempestuous
round
about
him
he
shall
call
to
the
heavens
from
above
and
to
the
earth
that
he
may
judge
his
people
gather
my
saints
together
unto
me
those
that
have
made
a
covenant
with
me
by
sacrifice
and
the
heavens
shall
declare
his
righteousness
for
god
is
judge
himself
selah
hear
o
my
people
and
i
will
speak
o
israel
and
i
will
testify
against
thee
i
am
god
even
thy
god
i
will
not
reprove
thee
for
thy
sacrifices
or
thy
burnt
offerings
to
have
been
continually
before
me
i
will
take
no
bullock
out
of
thy
house
nor
he
goats
out
of
thy
folds
for
every
beast
of
the
forest
is
mine
and
the
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
i
know
all
the
fowls
of
the
mountains
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
are
mine
if
i
were
hungry
i
would
not
tell
thee
for
the
world
is
mine
and
the
fulness
thereof
will
i
eat
the
flesh
of
bulls
or
drink
the
blood
of
goats
offer
unto
god
thanksgiving
and
pay
thy
vows
unto
the
most
high
and
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
but
unto
the
wicked
god
saith
what
hast
thou
to
do
to
declare
my
statutes
or
that
thou
shouldest
take
my
covenant
in
thy
mouth
seeing
thou
hatest
instruction
and
casteth
my
words
behind
thee
when
thou
sawest
a
thief
then
thou
consentedst
with
him
and
hast
been
partaker
with
adulterers
thou
givest
thy
mouth
to
evil
and
thy
tongue
frameth
deceit
thou
sittest
and
speakest
against
thy
brother
thou
slanderest
thine
own
mother's
son
these
things
hast
thou
done
and
i
kept
silence
thou
thoughtest
that
i
was
altogether
such
an
one
as
thyself
but
i
will
reprove
thee
and
set
them
in
order
before
thine
eyes
now
consider
this
ye
that
forget
god
lest
i
tear
you
in
pieces
and
there
be
none
to
deliver
whoso
offereth
praise
glorifieth
me
and
to
him
that
ordereth
his
conversation
aright
will
i
shew
the
salvation
of
god
have
mercy
upon
me
o
god
according
to
thy
lovingkindness
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
transgressions
wash
me
throughly
from
mine
iniquity
and
cleanse
me
from
my
sin
for
i
acknowledge
my
transgressions
and
my
sin
is
ever
before
me
against
thee
thee
only
have
i
sinned
and
done
this
evil
in
thy
sight
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
when
thou
speakest
and
be
clear
when
thou
judgest
behold
i
was
shapen
in
iniquity
and
in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
me
behold
thou
desirest
truth
in
the
inward
parts
and
in
the
hidden
part
thou
shalt
make
me
to
know
wisdom
purge
me
with
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
clean
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
whiter
than
snow
make
me
to
hear
joy
and
gladness
that
the
bones
which
thou
hast
broken
may
rejoice
hide
thy
face
from
my
sins
and
blot
out
all
mine
iniquities
create
in
me
a
clean
heart
o
god
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
me
cast
me
not
away
from
thy
presence
and
take
not
thy
holy
spirit
from
me
restore
unto
me
the
joy
of
thy
salvation
and
uphold
me
with
thy
free
spirit
then
will
i
teach
transgressors
thy
ways
and
sinners
shall
be
converted
unto
thee
deliver
me
from
bloodguiltiness
o
god
thou
god
of
my
salvation
and
my
tongue
shall
sing
aloud
of
thy
righteousness
o
lord
open
thou
my
lips
and
my
mouth
shall
shew
forth
thy
praise
for
thou
desirest
not
sacrifice
else
would
i
give
it
thou
delightest
not
in
burnt
offering
the
sacrifices
of
god
are
a
broken
spirit
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart
o
god
thou
wilt
not
despise
do
good
in
thy
good
pleasure
unto
zion
build
thou
the
walls
of
jerusalem
then
shalt
thou
be
pleased
with
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
with
burnt
offering
and
whole
burnt
offering
then
shall
they
offer
bullocks
upon
thine
altar
why
boastest
thou
thyself
in
mischief
o
mighty
man
the
goodness
of
god
endureth
continually
the
tongue
deviseth
mischiefs
like
a
sharp
razor
working
deceitfully
thou
lovest
evil
more
than
good
and
lying
rather
than
to
speak
righteousness
selah
thou
lovest
all
devouring
words
o
thou
deceitful
tongue
god
shall
likewise
destroy
thee
for
ever
he
shall
take
thee
away
and
pluck
thee
out
of
thy
dwelling
place
and
root
thee
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
selah
the
righteous
also
shall
see
and
fear
and
shall
laugh
at
him
lo
this
is
the
man
that
made
not
god
his
strength
but
trusted
in
the
abundance
of
his
riches
and
strengthened
himself
in
his
wickedness
but
i
am
like
a
green
olive
tree
in
the
house
of
god
i
trust
in
the
mercy
of
god
for
ever
and
ever
i
will
praise
thee
for
ever
because
thou
hast
done
it
and
i
will
wait
on
thy
name
for
it
is
good
before
thy
saints
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
corrupt
are
they
and
have
done
abominable
iniquity
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
god
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
the
children
of
men
to
see
if
there
were
any
that
did
understand
that
did
seek
god
every
one
of
them
is
gone
back
they
are
altogether
become
filthy
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
have
the
workers
of
iniquity
no
knowledge
who
eat
up
my
people
as
they
eat
bread
they
have
not
called
upon
god
there
were
they
in
great
fear
where
no
fear
was
for
god
hath
scattered
the
bones
of
him
that
encampeth
against
thee
thou
hast
put
them
to
shame
because
god
hath
despised
them
oh
that
the
salvation
of
israel
were
come
out
of
zion
when
god
bringeth
back
the
captivity
of
his
people
jacob
shall
rejoice
and
israel
shall
be
glad
save
me
o
god
by
thy
name
and
judge
me
by
thy
strength
hear
my
prayer
o
god
give
ear
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
for
strangers
are
risen
up
against
me
and
oppressors
seek
after
my
soul
they
have
not
set
god
before
them
selah
behold
god
is
mine
helper
the
lord
is
with
them
that
uphold
my
soul
he
shall
reward
evil
unto
mine
enemies
cut
them
off
in
thy
truth
i
will
freely
sacrifice
unto
thee
i
will
praise
thy
name
o
lord
for
it
is
good
for
he
hath
delivered
me
out
of
all
trouble
and
mine
eye
hath
seen
his
desire
upon
mine
enemies
give
ear
to
my
prayer
o
god
and
hide
not
thyself
from
my
supplication
attend
unto
me
and
hear
me
i
mourn
in
my
complaint
and
make
a
noise
because
of
the
voice
of
the
enemy
because
of
the
oppression
of
the
wicked
for
they
cast
iniquity
upon
me
and
in
wrath
they
hate
me
my
heart
is
sore
pained
within
me
and
the
terrors
of
death
are
fallen
upon
me
fearfulness
and
trembling
are
come
upon
me
and
horror
hath
overwhelmed
me
and
i
said
oh
that
i
had
wings
like
a
dove
for
then
would
i
fly
away
and
be
at
rest
lo
then
would
i
wander
far
off
and
remain
in
the
wilderness
selah
i
would
hasten
my
escape
from
the
windy
storm
and
tempest
destroy
o
lord
and
divide
their
tongues
for
i
have
seen
violence
and
strife
in
the
city
day
and
night
they
go
about
it
upon
the
walls
thereof
mischief
also
and
sorrow
are
in
the
midst
of
it
wickedness
is
in
the
midst
thereof
deceit
and
guile
depart
not
from
her
streets
for
it
was
not
an
enemy
that
reproached
me
then
i
could
have
borne
it
neither
was
it
he
that
hated
me
that
did
magnify
himself
against
me
then
i
would
have
hid
myself
from
him
but
it
was
thou
a
man
mine
equal
my
guide
and
mine
acquaintance
we
took
sweet
counsel
together
and
walked
unto
the
house
of
god
in
company
let
death
seize
upon
them
and
let
them
go
down
quick
into
hell
for
wickedness
is
in
their
dwellings
and
among
them
as
for
me
i
will
call
upon
god
and
the
lord
shall
save
me
evening
and
morning
and
at
noon
will
i
pray
and
cry
aloud
and
he
shall
hear
my
voice
he
hath
delivered
my
soul
in
peace
from
the
battle
that
was
against
me
for
there
were
many
with
me
god
shall
hear
and
afflict
them
even
he
that
abideth
of
old
selah
because
they
have
no
changes
therefore
they
fear
not
god
he
hath
put
forth
his
hands
against
such
as
be
at
peace
with
him
he
hath
broken
his
covenant
the
words
of
his
mouth
were
smoother
than
butter
but
war
was
in
his
heart
his
words
were
softer
than
oil
yet
were
they
drawn
swords
cast
thy
burden
upon
the
lord
and
he
shall
sustain
thee
he
shall
never
suffer
the
righteous
to
be
moved
but
thou
o
god
shalt
bring
them
down
into
the
pit
of
destruction
bloody
and
deceitful
men
shall
not
live
out
half
their
days
but
i
will
trust
in
thee
be
merciful
unto
me
o
god
for
man
would
swallow
me
up
he
fighting
daily
oppresseth
me
mine
enemies
would
daily
swallow
me
up
for
they
be
many
that
fight
against
me
o
thou
most
high
what
time
i
am
afraid
i
will
trust
in
thee
in
god
i
will
praise
his
word
in
god
i
have
put
my
trust
i
will
not
fear
what
flesh
can
do
unto
me
every
day
they
wrest
my
words
all
their
thoughts
are
against
me
for
evil
they
gather
themselves
together
they
hide
themselves
they
mark
my
steps
when
they
wait
for
my
soul
shall
they
escape
by
iniquity
in
thine
anger
cast
down
the
people
o
god
thou
tellest
my
wanderings
put
thou
my
tears
into
thy
bottle
are
they
not
in
thy
book
when
i
cry
unto
thee
then
shall
mine
enemies
turn
back
this
i
know
for
god
is
for
me
in
god
will
i
praise
his
word
in
the
lord
will
i
praise
his
word
in
god
have
i
put
my
trust
i
will
not
be
afraid
what
man
can
do
unto
me
thy
vows
are
upon
me
o
god
i
will
render
praises
unto
thee
for
thou
hast
delivered
my
soul
from
death
wilt
not
thou
deliver
my
feet
from
falling
that
i
may
walk
before
god
in
the
light
of
the
living
be
merciful
unto
me
o
god
be
merciful
unto
me
for
my
soul
trusteth
in
thee
yea
in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
i
make
my
refuge
until
these
calamities
be
overpast
i
will
cry
unto
god
most
high
unto
god
that
performeth
all
things
for
me
he
shall
send
from
heaven
and
save
me
from
the
reproach
of
him
that
would
swallow
me
up
selah
god
shall
send
forth
his
mercy
and
his
truth
my
soul
is
among
lions
and
i
lie
even
among
them
that
are
set
on
fire
even
the
sons
of
men
whose
teeth
are
spears
and
arrows
and
their
tongue
a
sharp
sword
be
thou
exalted
o
god
above
the
heavens
let
thy
glory
be
above
all
the
earth
they
have
prepared
a
net
for
my
steps
my
soul
is
bowed
down
they
have
digged
a
pit
before
me
into
the
midst
whereof
they
are
fallen
themselves
selah
my
heart
is
fixed
o
god
my
heart
is
fixed
i
will
sing
and
give
praise
awake
up
my
glory
awake
psaltery
and
harp
i
myself
will
awake
early
i
will
praise
thee
o
lord
among
the
people
i
will
sing
unto
thee
among
the
nations
for
thy
mercy
is
great
unto
the
heavens
and
thy
truth
unto
the
clouds
be
thou
exalted
o
god
above
the
heavens
let
thy
glory
be
above
all
the
earth
do
ye
indeed
speak
righteousness
o
congregation
do
ye
judge
uprightly
o
ye
sons
of
men
yea
in
heart
ye
work
wickedness
ye
weigh
the
violence
of
your
hands
in
the
earth
the
wicked
are
estranged
from
the
womb
they
go
astray
as
soon
as
they
be
born
speaking
lies
their
poison
is
like
the
poison
of
a
serpent
they
are
like
the
deaf
adder
that
stoppeth
her
ear
which
will
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
charmers
charming
never
so
wisely
break
their
teeth
o
god
in
their
mouth
break
out
the
great
teeth
of
the
young
lions
o
lord
let
them
melt
away
as
waters
which
run
continually
when
he
bendeth
his
bow
to
shoot
his
arrows
let
them
be
as
cut
in
pieces
as
a
snail
which
melteth
let
every
one
of
them
pass
away
like
the
untimely
birth
of
a
woman
that
they
may
not
see
the
sun
before
your
pots
can
feel
the
thorns
he
shall
take
them
away
as
with
a
whirlwind
both
living
and
in
his
wrath
the
righteous
shall
rejoice
when
he
seeth
the
vengeance
he
shall
wash
his
feet
in
the
blood
of
the
wicked
so
that
a
man
shall
say
verily
there
is
a
reward

thirsteth
for

longeth
for

in
a
dry
and
thirsty
land
where
no
water
is
to
see
thy
power
and
thy
glory
so
as
i
have
seen
thee
in
the
sanctuary
because
thy
lovingkindness
is
better
than
life
my
lips
shall
praise
thee
thus
will
i
bless
thee
while

i
will
lift
up
my
hands
in

thee
upon

on
thee
in
the
night
watches

in
the
shadow
of
thy
wings
will
i
rejoice
my
soul
followeth
hard
after
thee
thy
right
hand
upholdeth
me
but
those
that
seek
my
soul
to
destroy
it
shall
go
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
they
shall
fall
by
the
sword
they
shall
be
a
portion
for
foxes
but
the
king
shall
rejoice

one
that
sweareth
by

be
stopped

my
voice
o
god
in
my
prayer
preserve
my
life
from
fear
of
the
enemy
hide
me
from
the
secret
counsel
of
the
wicked
from
the
insurrection
of
the
workers
of
iniquity
who
whet
their
tongue
like
a
sword
and
bend
their
bows
to
shoot
their
arrows
even
bitter
words
that
they
may
shoot
in
secret
at
the
perfect
suddenly
do
they
shoot
at
him
and
fear
not
they
encourage
themselves
in
an
evil
matter
they
commune
of
laying
snares
privily
they
say
who
shall
see
them
they
search
out
iniquities
they
accomplish
a
diligent
search
both
the
inward
thought
of
every
one
of
them
and
the
heart
is
deep
but
god
shall
shoot
at
them
with
an
arrow
suddenly
shall
they
be
wounded
so
they
shall
make
their
own
tongue
to
fall
upon
themselves
all
that
see
them
shall
flee
away
and
all
men
shall
fear
and
shall
declare
the
work
of
god
for
they
shall
wisely
consider
of
his
doing
the
righteous
shall
be
glad
in
the
lord
and
shall
trust
in
him
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
glory
praise
waiteth
for
thee
o
god
in
sion
and
unto
thee
shall
the
vow
be
performed
o
thou
that
hearest
prayer
unto
thee
shall
all
flesh
come
iniquities
prevail
against
me
as
for
our
transgressions
thou
shalt
purge
them
away
blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
choosest
and
causest
to
approach
unto
thee
that
he
may
dwell
in
thy
courts
we
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
goodness
of
thy
house
even
of
thy
holy
temple
by
terrible
things
