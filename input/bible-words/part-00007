ship
and
ye
shall
find
they
cast
therefore
and
now
they
were
not
able
to
draw
it
for
the
multitude
of
fishes
therefore
that
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
saith
unto
peter
it
is
the
lord
now
when
simon
peter
heard
that
it
was
the
lord
he
girt
his
fisher's
coat
unto
him
for
he
was
naked
and
did
cast
himself
into
the
sea
and
the
other
disciples
came
in
a
little
ship
for
they
were
not
far
from
land
but
as
it
were
two
hundred
cubits
dragging
the
net
with
fishes
as
soon
then
as
they
were
come
to
land
they
saw
a
fire
of
coals
there
and
fish
laid
thereon
and
bread
jesus
saith
unto
them
bring
of
the
fish
which
ye
have
now
caught
simon
peter
went
up
and
drew
the
net
to
land
full
of
great
fishes
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
three
and
for
all
there
were
so
many
yet
was
not
the
net
broken
jesus
saith
unto
them
come
and
dine
and
none
of
the
disciples
durst
ask
him
who
art
thou
knowing
that
it
was
the
lord
jesus
then
cometh
and
taketh
bread
and
giveth
them
and
fish
likewise
this
is
now
the
third
time
that
jesus
shewed
himself
to
his
disciples
after
that
he
was
risen
from
the
dead
so
when
they
had
dined
jesus
saith
to
simon
peter
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
more
than
these
he
saith
unto
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
unto
him
feed
my
lambs
he
saith
to
him
again
the
second
time
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
he
saith
unto
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
unto
him
feed
my
sheep
he
saith
unto
him
the
third
time
simon
son
of
jonas
lovest
thou
me
peter
was
grieved
because
he
said
unto
him
the
third
time
lovest
thou
me
and
he
said
unto
him
lord
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
jesus
saith
unto
him
feed
my
sheep
verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
when
thou
wast
young
thou
girdest
thyself
and
walkedst
whither
thou
wouldest
but
when
thou
shalt
be
old
thou
shalt
stretch
forth
thy
hands
and
another
shall
gird
thee
and
carry
thee
whither
thou
wouldest
not
this
spake
he
signifying
by
what
death
he
should
glorify
god
and
when
he
had
spoken
this
he
saith
unto
him
follow
me
then
peter
turning
about
seeth
the
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
following
which
also
leaned
on
his
breast
at
supper
and
said
lord
which
is
he
that
betrayeth
thee
peter
seeing
him
saith
to
jesus
lord
and
what
shall
this
man
do
jesus
saith
unto
him
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
come
what
is
that
to
thee
follow
thou
me
then
went
this
saying
abroad
among
the
brethren
that
that
disciple
should
not
die
yet
jesus
said
not
unto
him
he
shall
not
die
but
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
come
what
is
that
to
thee
this
is
the
disciple
which
testifieth
of
these
things
and
wrote
these
things
and
we
know
that
his
testimony
is
true
and
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
jesus
did
the
which
if
they
should
be
written
every
one
i
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
books
that
should
be
written
amen
the
acts
of
the
apostles
the
former
treatise
have
i
made
o
theophilus
of
all
that
jesus
began
both
to
do
and
teach
until
the
day
in
which
he
was
taken
up
after
that
he
through
the
holy
ghost
had
given
commandments
unto
the
apostles
whom
he
had
chosen
to
whom
also
he
shewed
himself
alive
after
his
passion
by
many
infallible
proofs
being
seen
of
them
forty
days
and
speaking
of
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
being
assembled
together
with
them
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
depart
from
jerusalem
but
wait
for
the
promise
of
the
father
which
saith
he
ye
have
heard
of
me
for
john
truly
baptized
with
water
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
not
many
days
hence
when
they
therefore
were
come
together
they
asked
of
him
saying
lord
wilt
thou
at
this
time
restore
again
the
kingdom
to
israel
and
he
said
unto
them
it
is
not
for
you
to
know
the
times
or
the
seasons
which
the
father
hath
put
in
his
own
power
but
ye
shall
receive
power
after
that
the
holy
ghost
is
come
upon
you
and
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
both
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judaea
and
in
samaria
and
unto
the
uttermost
part
of
the
earth
and
when
he
had
spoken
these
things
while
they
beheld
he
was
taken
up
and
a
cloud
received
him
out
of
their
sight
and
while
they
looked
stedfastly
toward
heaven
as
he
went
up
behold
two
men
stood
by
them
in
white
apparel
which
also
said
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
this
same
jesus
which
is
taken
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
seen
him
go
into
heaven
then
returned
they
unto
jerusalem
from
the
mount
called
olivet
which
is
from
jerusalem
a
sabbath
day's
journey
and
when
they
were
come
in
they
went
up
into
an
upper
room
where
abode
both
peter
and
james
and
john
and
andrew
philip
and
thomas
bartholomew
and
matthew
james
the
son
of
alphaeus
and
simon
zelotes
and
judas
the
brother
of
james
these
all
continued
with
one
accord
in
prayer
and
supplication
with
the
women
and
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
and
with
his
brethren
and
in
those
days
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
disciples
and
said
the
number
of
names
together
were
about
an
hundred
and
twenty
men
and
brethren
this
scripture
must
needs
have
been
fulfilled
which
the
holy
ghost
by
the
mouth
of
david
spake
before
concerning
judas
which
was
guide
to
them
that
took
jesus
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
had
obtained
part
of
this
ministry
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
reward
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
asunder
in
the
midst
and
all
his
bowels
gushed
out
and
it
was
known
unto
all
the
dwellers
at
jerusalem
insomuch
as
that
field
is
called
in
their
proper
tongue
aceldama
that
is
to
say
the
field
of
blood
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
habitation
be
desolate
and
let
no
man
dwell
therein
and
his
bishoprick
let
another
take
wherefore
of
these
men
which
have
companied
with
us
all
the
time
that
the
lord
jesus
went
in
and
out
among
us
beginning
from
the
baptism
of
john
unto
that
same
day
that
he
was
taken
up
from
us
must
one
be
ordained
to
be
a
witness
with
us
of
his
resurrection
and
they
appointed
two
joseph
called
barsabas
who
was
surnamed
justus
and
matthias
and
they
prayed
and
said
thou
lord
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
men
shew
whether
of
these
two
thou
hast
chosen
that
he
may
take
part
of
this
ministry
and
apostleship
from
which
judas
by
transgression
fell
that
he
might
go
to
his
own
place
and
they
gave
forth
their
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
matthias
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles
and
when
the
day
of
pentecost
was
fully
come
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
one
place
and
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
from
heaven
as
of
a
rushing
mighty
wind
and
it
filled
all
the
house
where
they
were
sitting
and
there
appeared
unto
them
cloven
tongues
like
as
of
fire
and
it
sat
upon
each
of
them
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
began
to
speak
with
other
tongues
as
the
spirit
gave
them
utterance
and
there
were
dwelling
at
jerusalem
jews
devout
men
out
of
every
nation
under
heaven
now
when
this
was
noised
abroad
the
multitude
came
together
and
were
confounded
because
that
every
man
heard
them
speak
in
his
own
language
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
marvelled
saying
one
to
another
behold
are
not
all
these
which
speak
galilaeans
and
how
hear
we
every
man
in
our
own
tongue
wherein
we
were
born
parthians
and
medes
and
elamites
and
the
dwellers
in
mesopotamia
and
in
judaea
and
cappadocia
in
pontus
and
asia
phrygia
and
pamphylia
in
egypt
and
in
the
parts
of
libya
about
cyrene
and
strangers
of
rome
jews
and
proselytes
cretes
and
arabians
we
do
hear
them
speak
in
our
tongues
the
wonderful
works
of
god
and
they
were
all
amazed
and
were
in
doubt
saying
one
to
another
what
meaneth
this
others
mocking
said
these
men
are
full
of
new
wine
but
peter
standing
up
with
the
eleven
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
unto
them
ye
men
of
judaea
and
all
ye
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
be
this
known
unto
you
and
hearken
to
my
words
for
these
are
not
drunken
as
ye
suppose
seeing
it
is
but
the
third
hour
of
the
day
but
this
is
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
joel
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
saith
god
i
will
pour
out
of
my
spirit
upon
all
flesh
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy
and
your
young
men
shall
see
visions
and
your
old
men
shall
dream
dreams
and
on
my
servants
and
on
my
handmaidens
i
will
pour
out
in
those
days
of
my
spirit
and
they
shall
prophesy
and
i
will
shew
wonders
in
heaven
above
and
signs
in
the
earth
beneath
blood
and
fire
and
vapour
of
smoke
the
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
notable
day
of
the
lord
come
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
saved
ye
men
of
israel
hear
these
words
jesus
of
nazareth
a
man
approved
of
god
among
you
by
miracles
and
wonders
and
signs
which
god
did
by
him
in
the
midst
of
you
as
ye
yourselves
also
know
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
ye
have
taken
and
by
wicked
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
whom
god
hath
raised
up
having
loosed
the
pains
of
death
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
it
for
david
speaketh
concerning
him
i
foresaw
the
lord
always
before
my
face
for
he
is
on
my
right
hand
that
i
should
not
be
moved
therefore
did
my
heart
rejoice
and
my
tongue
was
glad
moreover
also
my
flesh
shall
rest
in
hope
because
thou
wilt
not
leave
my
soul
in
hell
neither
wilt
thou
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
thou
hast
made
known
to
me
the
ways
of
life
thou
shalt
make
me
full
of
joy
with
thy
countenance
men
and
brethren
let
me
freely
speak
unto
you
of
the
patriarch
david
that
he
is
both
dead
and
buried
and
his
sepulchre
is
with
us
unto
this
day
therefore
being
a
prophet
and
knowing
that
god
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
him
that
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
according
to
the
flesh
he
would
raise
up
christ
to
sit
on
his
throne
he
seeing
this
before
spake
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
that
his
soul
was
not
left
in
hell
neither
his
flesh
did
see
corruption
this
jesus
hath
god
raised
up
whereof
we
all
are
witnesses
therefore
being
by
the
right
hand
of
god
exalted
and
having
received
of
the
father
the
promise
of
the
holy
ghost
he
hath
shed
forth
this
which
ye
now
see
and
hear
for
david
is
not
ascended
into
the
heavens
but
he
saith
himself
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thy
foes
thy
footstool
therefore
let
all
the
house
of
israel
know
assuredly
that
god
hath
made
the
same
jesus
whom
ye
have
crucified
both
lord
and
christ
now
when
they
heard
this
they
were
pricked
in
their
heart
and
said
unto
peter
and
to
the
rest
of
the
apostles
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
then
peter
said
unto
them
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
for
the
promise
is
unto
you
and
to
your
children
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off
even
as
many
as
the
lord
our
god
shall
call
and
with
many
other
words
did
he
testify
and
exhort
saying
save
yourselves
from
this
untoward
generation
then
they
that
gladly
received
his
word
were
baptized
and
the
same
day
there
were
added
unto
them
about
three
thousand
souls
and
they
continued
stedfastly
in
the
apostles
doctrine
and
fellowship
and
in
breaking
of
bread
and
in
prayers
and
fear
came
upon
every
soul
and
many
wonders
and
signs
were
done
by
the
apostles
and
all
that
believed
were
together
and
had
all
things
common
and
sold
their
possessions
and
goods
and
parted
them
to
all
men
as
every
man
had
need
and
they
continuing
daily
with
one
accord
in
the
temple
and
breaking
bread
from
house
to
house
did
eat
their
meat
with
gladness
and
singleness
of
heart
praising
god
and
having
favour
with
all
the
people
and
the
lord
added
to
the
church
daily
such
as
should
be
saved
now
peter
and
john
went
up
together
into
the
temple
at
the
hour
of
prayer
being
the
ninth
hour
and
a
certain
man
lame
from
his
mother's
womb
was
carried
whom
they
laid
daily
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
which
is
called
beautiful
to
ask
alms
of
them
that
entered
into
the
temple
who
seeing
peter
and
john
about
to
go
into
the
temple
asked
an
alms
and
peter
fastening
his
eyes
upon
him
with
john
said
look
on
us
and
he
gave
heed
unto
them
expecting
to
receive
something
of
them
then
peter
said
silver
and
gold
have
i
none
but
such
as
i
have
give
i
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
rise
up
and
walk
and
he
took
him
by
the
right
hand
and
lifted
him
up
and
immediately
his
feet
and
ankle
bones
received
strength
and
he
leaping
up
stood
and
walked
and
entered
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
god
and
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
god
and
they
knew
that
it
was
he
which
sat
for
alms
at
the
beautiful
gate
of
the
temple
and
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
that
which
had
happened
unto
him
and
as
the
lame
man
which
was
healed
held
peter
and
john
all
the
people
ran
together
unto
them
in
the
porch
that
is
called
solomon's
greatly
wondering
and
when
peter
saw
it
he
answered
unto
the
people
ye
men
of
israel
why
marvel
ye
at
this
or
why
look
ye
so
earnestly
on
us
as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
walk
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
glorified
his
son
jesus
whom
ye
delivered
up
and
denied
him
in
the
presence
of
pilate
when
he
was
determined
to
let
him
go
but
ye
denied
the
holy
one
and
the
just
and
desired
a
murderer
to
be
granted
unto
you
and
killed
the
prince
of
life
whom
god
hath
raised
from
the
dead
whereof
we
are
witnesses
and
his
name
through
faith
in
his
name
hath
made
this
man
strong
whom
ye
see
and
know
yea
the
faith
which
is
by
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you
all
and
now
brethren
i
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
it
as
did
also
your
rulers
but
those
things
which
god
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
that
christ
should
suffer
he
hath
so
fulfilled
repent
ye
therefore
and
be
converted
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
out
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
send
jesus
christ
which
before
was
preached
unto
you
whom
the
heaven
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
things
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
for
moses
truly
said
unto
the
fathers
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
people
yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
those
that
follow
after
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
days
ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
our
fathers
saying
unto
abraham
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
unto
you
first
god
having
raised
up
his
son
jesus
sent
him
to
bless
you
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
iniquities
and
as
they
spake
unto
the
people
the
priests
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
sadducees
came
upon
them
being
grieved
that
they
taught
the
people
and
preached
through
jesus
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
they
laid
hands
on
them
and
put
them
in
hold
unto
the
next
day
for
it
was
now
eventide
howbeit
many
of
them
which
heard
the
word
believed
and
the
number
of
the
men
was
about
five
thousand
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
their
rulers
and
elders
and
scribes
and
annas
the
high
priest
and
caiaphas
and
john
and
alexander
and
as
many
as
were
of
the
kindred
of
the
high
priest
were
gathered
together
at
jerusalem
and
when
they
had
set
them
in
the
midst
they
asked
by
what
power
or
by
what
name
have
ye
done
this
then
peter
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
said
unto
them
ye
rulers
of
the
people
and
elders
of
israel
if
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent
man
by
what
means
he
is
made
whole
be
it
known
unto
you
all
and
to
all
the
people
of
israel
that
by
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
whom
ye
crucified
whom
god
raised
from
the
dead
even
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole
this
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
nought
of
you
builders
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
other
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
now
when
they
saw
the
boldness
of
peter
and
john
and
perceived
that
they
were
unlearned
and
ignorant
men
they
marvelled
and
they
took
knowledge
of
them
that
they
had
been
with
jesus
and
beholding
the
man
which
was
healed
standing
with
them
they
could
say
nothing
against
it
but
when
they
had
commanded
them
to
go
aside
out
of
the
council
they
conferred
among
themselves
saying
what
shall
we
do
to
these
men
for
that
indeed
a
notable
miracle
hath
been
done
by
them
is
manifest
to
all
them
that
dwell
in
jerusalem
and
we
cannot
deny
it
but
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the
people
let
us
straitly
threaten
them
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
this
name
and
they
called
them
and
commanded
them
not
to
speak
at
all
nor
teach
in
the
name
of
jesus
but
peter
and
john
answered
and
said
unto
them
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
hearken
unto
you
more
than
unto
god
judge
ye
for
we
cannot
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
so
when
they
had
further
threatened
them
they
let
them
go
finding
nothing
how
they
might
punish
them
because
of
the
people
for
all
men
glorified
god
for
that
which
was
done
for
the
man
was
above
forty
years
old
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
was
shewed
and
being
let
go
they
went
to
their
own
company
and
reported
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
unto
them
and
when
they
heard
that
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
god
with
one
accord
and
said
lord
thou
art
god
which
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
who
by
the
mouth
of
thy
servant
david
hast
said
why
did
the
heathen
rage
and
the
people
imagine
vain
things
the
kings
of
the
earth
stood
up
and
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
christ
for
of
a
truth
against
thy
holy
child
jesus
whom
thou
hast
anointed
both
herod
and
pontius
pilate
with
the
gentiles
and
the
people
of
israel
were
gathered
together
for
to
do
whatsoever
thy
hand
and
thy
counsel
determined
before
to
be
done
and
now
lord
behold
their
threatenings
and
grant
unto
thy
servants
that
with
all
boldness
they
may
speak
thy
word
by
stretching
forth
thine
hand
to
heal
and
that
signs
and
wonders
may
be
done
by
the
name
of
thy
holy
child
jesus
and
when
they
had
prayed
the
place
was
shaken
where
they
were
assembled
together
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
they
spake
the
word
of
god
with
boldness
and
the
multitude
of
them
that
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
soul
neither
said
any
of
them
that
ought
of
the
things
which
he
possessed
was
his
own
but
they
had
all
things
common
and
with
great
power
gave
the
apostles
witness
of
the
resurrection
of
the
lord
jesus
and
great
grace
was
upon
them
all
neither
was
there
any
among
them
that
lacked
for
as
many
as
were
possessors
of
lands
or
houses
sold
them
and
brought
the
prices
of
the
things
that
were
sold
and
laid
them
down
at
the
apostles
feet
and
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
according
as
he
had
need
and
joses
who
by
the
apostles
was
surnamed
barnabas
which
is
being
interpreted
the
son
of
consolation
a
levite
and
of
the
country
of
cyprus
having
land
sold
it
and
brought
the
money
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles
feet
but
a
certain
man
named
ananias
with
sapphira
his
wife
sold
a
possession
and
kept
back
part
of
the
price
his
wife
also
being
privy
to
it
and
brought
a
certain
part
and
laid
it
at
the
apostles
feet
but
peter
said
ananias
why
hath
satan
filled
thine
heart
to
lie
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
keep
back
part
of
the
price
of
the
land
whiles
it
remained
was
it
not
thine
own
and
after
it
was
sold
was
it
not
in
thine
own
power
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thine
heart
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
god
and
ananias
hearing
these
words
fell
down
and
gave
up
the
ghost
and
great
fear
came
on
all
them
that
heard
these
things
and
the
young
men
arose
wound
him
up
and
carried
him
out
and
buried
him
and
it
was
about
the
space
of
three
hours
after
when
his
wife
not
knowing
what
was
done
came
in
and
peter
answered
unto
her
tell
me
whether
ye
sold
the
land
for
so
much
and
she
said
yea
for
so
much
then
peter
said
unto
her
how
is
it
that
ye
have
agreed
together
to
tempt
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
the
feet
of
them
which
have
buried
thy
husband
are
at
the
door
and
shall
carry
thee
out
then
fell
she
down
straightway
at
his
feet
and
yielded
up
the
ghost
and
the
young
men
came
in
and
found
her
dead
and
carrying
her
forth
buried
her
by
her
husband
and
great
fear
came
upon
all
the
church
and
upon
as
many
as
heard
these
things
and
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
were
many
signs
and
wonders
wrought
among
the
people
and
they
were
all
with
one
accord
in
solomon's
porch
and
of
the
rest
durst
no
man
join
himself
to
them
but
the
people
magnified
them
and
believers
were
the
more
added
to
the
lord
multitudes
both
of
men
and
women
insomuch
that
they
brought
forth
the
sick
into
the
streets
and
laid
them
on
beds
and
couches
that
at
the
least
the
shadow
of
peter
passing
by
might
overshadow
some
of
them
there
came
also
a
multitude
out
of
the
cities
round
about
unto
jerusalem
bringing
sick
folks
and
them
which
were
vexed
with
unclean
spirits
and
they
were
healed
every
one
then
the
high
priest
rose
up
and
all
they
that
were
with
him
which
is
the
sect
of
the
sadducees
and
were
filled
with
indignation
and
laid
their
hands
on
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
the
common
prison
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
by
night
opened
the
prison
doors
and
brought
them
forth
and
said
go
stand
and
speak
in
the
temple
to
the
people
all
the
words
of
this
life
and
when
they
heard
that
they
entered
into
the
temple
early
in
the
morning
and
taught
but
the
high
priest
came
and
they
that
were
with
him
and
called
the
council
together
and
all
the
senate
of
the
children
of
israel
and
sent
to
the
prison
to
have
them
brought
but
when
the
officers
came
and
found
them
not
in
the
prison
they
returned
and
told
saying
the
prison
truly
found
we
shut
with
all
safety
and
the
keepers
standing
without
before
the
doors
but
when
we
had
opened
we
found
no
man
within
now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
things
they
doubted
of
them
whereunto
this
would
grow
then
came
one
and
told
them
saying
behold
the
men
whom
ye
put
in
prison
are
standing
in
the
temple
and
teaching
the
people
then
went
the
captain
with
the
officers
and
brought
them
without
violence
for
they
feared
the
people
lest
they
should
have
been
stoned
and
when
they
had
brought
them
they
set
them
before
the
council
and
the
high
priest
asked
them
saying
did
not
we
straitly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
name
and
behold
ye
have
filled
jerusalem
with
your
doctrine
and
intend
to
bring
this
man's
blood
upon
us
then
peter
and
the
other
apostles
answered
and
said
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
jesus
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
him
hath
god
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
prince
and
a
saviour
for
to
give
repentance
to
israel
and
forgiveness
of
sins
and
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
things
and
so
is
also
the
holy
ghost
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
him
when
they
heard
that
they
were
cut
to
the
heart
and
took
counsel
to
slay
them
then
stood
there
up
one
in
the
council
a
pharisee
named
gamaliel
a
doctor
of
the
law
had
in
reputation
among
all
the
people
and
commanded
to
put
the
apostles
forth
a
little
space
and
said
unto
them
ye
men
of
israel
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
men
for
before
these
days
rose
up
theudas
boasting
himself
to
be
somebody
to
whom
a
number
of
men
about
four
hundred
joined
themselves
who
was
slain
and
all
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
scattered
and
brought
to
nought
after
this
man
rose
up
judas
of
galilee
in
the
days
of
the
taxing
and
drew
away
much
people
after
him
he
also
perished
and
all
even
as
many
as
obeyed
him
were
dispersed
and
now
i
say
unto
you
refrain
from
these
men
and
let
them
alone
for
if
this
counsel
or
this
work
be
of
men
it
will
come
to
nought
but
if
it
be
of
god
ye
cannot
overthrow
it
lest
haply
ye
be
found
even
to
fight
against
god
and
to
him
they
agreed
and
when
they
had
called
the
apostles
and
beaten
them
they
commanded
that
they
should
not
speak
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
let
them
go
and
they
departed
from
the
presence
of
the
council
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
name
and
daily
in
the
temple
and
in
every
house
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
jesus
christ
and
in
those
days
when
the
number
of
the
disciples
was
multiplied
there
arose
a
murmuring
of
the
grecians
against
the
hebrews
because
their
widows
were
neglected
in
the
daily
ministration
then
the
twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
unto
them
and
said
it
is
not
reason
that
we
should
leave
the
word
of
god
and
serve
tables
wherefore
brethren
look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
report
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
wisdom
whom
we
may
appoint
over
this
business
but
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
prayer
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
word
and
the
saying
pleased
the
whole
multitude
and
they
chose
stephen
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
philip
and
prochorus
and
nicanor
and
timon
and
parmenas
and
nicolas
a
proselyte
of
antioch
whom
they
set
before
the
apostles
and
when
they
had
prayed
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
and
the
word
of
god
increased
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
multiplied
in
jerusalem
greatly
and
a
great
company
of
the
priests
were
obedient
to
the
faith
and
stephen
full
of
faith
and
power
did
great
wonders
and
miracles
among
the
people
then
there
arose
certain
of
the
synagogue
which
is
called
the
synagogue
of
the
libertines
and
cyrenians
and
alexandrians
and
of
them
of
cilicia
and
of
asia
disputing
with
stephen
and
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
by
which
he
spake
then
they
suborned
men
which
said
we
have
heard
him
speak
blasphemous
words
against
moses
and
against
god
and
they
stirred
up
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
came
upon
him
and
caught
him
and
brought
him
to
the
council
and
set
up
false
witnesses
which
said
this
man
ceaseth
not
to
speak
blasphemous
words
against
this
holy
place
and
the
law
for
we
have
heard
him
say
that
this
jesus
of
nazareth
shall
destroy
this
place
and
shall
change
the
customs
which
moses
delivered
us
and
all
that
sat
in
the
council
looking
stedfastly
on
him
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
then
said
the
high
priest
are
these
things
so
and
he
said
men
brethren
and
fathers
hearken
the
god
of
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
abraham
when
he
was
in
mesopotamia
before
he
dwelt
in
charran
and
said
unto
him
get
thee
out
of
thy
country
and
from
thy
kindred
and
come
into
the
land
which
i
shall
shew
thee
then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
chaldaeans
and
dwelt
in
charran
and
from
thence
when
his
father
was
dead
he
removed
him
into
this
land
wherein
ye
now
dwell
and
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
it
no
not
so
much
as
to
set
his
foot
on
yet
he
promised
that
he
would
give
it
to
him
for
a
possession
and
to
his
seed
after
him
when
as
yet
he
had
no
child
and
god
spake
on
this
wise
that
his
seed
should
sojourn
in
a
strange
land
and
that
they
should
bring
them
into
bondage
and
entreat
them
evil
four
hundred
years
and
the
nation
to
whom
they
shall
be
in
bondage
will
i
judge
said
god
and
after
that
shall
they
come
forth
and
serve
me
in
this
place
and
he
gave
him
the
covenant
of
circumcision
and
so
abraham
begat
isaac
and
circumcised
him
the
eighth
day
and
isaac
begat
jacob
and
jacob
begat
the
twelve
patriarchs
and
the
patriarchs
moved
with
envy
sold
joseph
into
egypt
but
god
was
with
him
and
delivered
him
out
of
all
his
afflictions
and
gave
him
favour
and
wisdom
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
he
made
him
governor
over
egypt
and
all
his
house
now
there
came
a
dearth
over
all
the
land
of
egypt
and
chanaan
and
great
affliction
and
our
fathers
found
no
sustenance
but
when
jacob
heard
that
there
was
corn
in
egypt
he
sent
out
our
fathers
first
and
at
the
second
time
joseph
was
made
known
to
his
brethren
and
joseph's
kindred
was
made
known
unto
pharaoh
then
sent
joseph
and
called
his
father
jacob
to
him
and
all
his
kindred
threescore
and
fifteen
souls
so
jacob
went
down
into
egypt
and
died
he
and
our
fathers
and
were
carried
over
into
sychem
and
laid
in
the
sepulchre
that
abraham
bought
for
a
sum
of
money
of
the
sons
of
emmor
the
father
of
sychem
but
when
the
time
of
the
promise
drew
nigh
which
god
had
sworn
to
abraham
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
in
egypt
till
another
king
arose
which
knew
not
joseph
the
same
dealt
subtilly
with
our
kindred
and
evil
entreated
our
fathers
so
that
they
cast
out
their
young
children
to
the
end
they
might
not
live
in
which
time
moses
was
born
and
was
exceeding
fair
and
nourished
up
in
his
father's
house
three
months
and
when
he
was
cast
out
pharaoh's
daughter
took
him
up
and
nourished
him
for
her
own
son
and
moses
was
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
and
was
mighty
in
words
and
in
deeds
and
when
he
was
full
forty
years
old
it
came
into
his
heart
to
visit
his
brethren
the
children
of
israel
and
seeing
one
of
them
suffer
wrong
he
defended
him
and
avenged
him
that
was
oppressed
and
smote
the
egyptian
for
he
supposed
his
brethren
would
have
understood
how
that
god
by
his
hand
would
deliver
them
but
they
understood
not
and
the
next
day
he
shewed
himself
unto
them
as
they
strove
and
would
have
set
them
at
one
again
saying
sirs
ye
are
brethren
why
do
ye
wrong
one
to
another
but
he
that
did
his
neighbour
wrong
thrust
him
away
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
over
us
wilt
thou
kill
me
as
thou
diddest
the
egyptian
yesterday
then
fled
moses
at
this
saying
and
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
of
madian
where
he
begat
two
sons
and
when
forty
years
were
expired
there
appeared
to
him
in
the
wilderness
of
mount
sina
an
angel
of
the
lord
in
a
flame
of
fire
in
a
bush
when
moses
saw
it
he
wondered
at
the
sight
and
as
he
drew
near
to
behold
it
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
i
am
the
god
of
thy
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
then
moses
trembled
and
durst
not
behold
then
said
the
lord
to
him
put
off
thy
shoes
from
thy
feet
for
the
place
where
thou
standest
is
holy
ground
i
have
seen
i
have
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
is
in
egypt
and
i
have
heard
their
groaning
and
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
and
now
come
i
will
send
thee
into
egypt
this
moses
whom
they
refused
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
the
same
did
god
send
to
be
a
ruler
and
a
deliverer
by
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
appeared
to
him
in
the
bush
he
brought
them
out
after
that
he
had
shewed
wonders
and
signs
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
in
the
red
sea
and
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
this
is
that
moses
which
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
this
is
he
that
was
in
the
church
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
which
spake
to
him
in
the
mount
sina
and
with
our
fathers
who
received
the
lively
oracles
to
give
unto
us
to
whom
our
fathers
would
not
obey
but
thrust
him
from
them
and
in
their
hearts
turned
back
again
into
egypt
saying
unto
aaron
make
us
gods
to
go
before
us
for
as
for
this
moses
which
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him
and
they
made
a
calf
in
those
days
and
offered
sacrifice
unto
the
idol
and
rejoiced
in
the
works
of
their
own
hands
then
god
turned
and
gave
them
up
to
worship
the
host
of
heaven
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophets
o
ye
house
of
israel
have
ye
offered
to
me
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
by
the
space
of
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
yea
ye
took
up
the
tabernacle
of
moloch
and
the
star
of
your
god
remphan
figures
which
ye
made
to
worship
them
and
i
will
carry
you
away
beyond
babylon
our
fathers
had
the
tabernacle
of
witness
in
the
wilderness
as
he
had
appointed
speaking
unto
moses
that
he
should
make
it
according
to
the
fashion
that
he
had
seen
which
also
our
fathers
that
came
after
brought
in
with
jesus
into
the
possession
of
the
gentiles
whom
god
drave
out
before
the
face
of
our
fathers
unto
the
days
of
david
who
found
favour
before
god
and
desired
to
find
a
tabernacle
for
the
god
of
jacob
but
solomon
built
him
an
house
howbeit
the
most
high
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
as
saith
the
prophet
heaven
is
my
throne
and
earth
is
my
footstool
what
house
will
ye
build
me
saith
the
lord
or
what
is
the
place
of
my
rest
hath
not
my
hand
made
all
these
things
ye
stiffnecked
and
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
ears
ye
do
always
resist
the
holy
ghost
as
your
fathers
did
so
do
ye
which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted
and
they
have
slain
them
which
shewed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
just
one
of
whom
ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
murderers
who
have
received
the
law
by
the
disposition
of
angels
and
have
not
kept
it
when
they
heard
these
things
they
were
cut
to
the
heart
and
they
gnashed
on
him
with
their
teeth
but
he
being
full
of
the
holy
ghost
looked
up
stedfastly
into
heaven
and
saw
the
glory
of
god
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
and
said
behold
i
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
then
they
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
stopped
their
ears
and
ran
upon
him
with
one
accord
and
cast
him
out
of
the
city
and
stoned
him
and
the
witnesses
laid
down
their
clothes
at
a
young
man's
feet
whose
name
was
saul
and
they
stoned
stephen
calling
upon
god
and
saying
lord
jesus
receive
my
spirit
and
he
kneeled
down
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
asleep
and
saul
was
consenting
unto
his
death
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
persecution
against
the
church
which
was
at
jerusalem
and
they
were
all
scattered
abroad
throughout
the
regions
of
judaea
and
samaria
except
the
apostles
and
devout
men
carried
stephen
to
his
burial
and
made
great
lamentation
over
him
as
for
saul
he
made
havock
of
the
church
entering
into
every
house
and
haling
men
and
women
committed
them
to
prison
therefore
they
that
were
scattered
abroad
went
every
where
preaching
the
word
then
philip
went
down
to
the
city
of
samaria
and
preached
christ
unto
them
and
the
people
with
one
accord
gave
heed
unto
those
things
which
philip
spake
hearing
and
seeing
the
miracles
which
he
did
for
unclean
spirits
crying
with
loud
voice
came
out
of
many
that
were
possessed
with
them
and
many
taken
with
palsies
and
that
were
lame
were
healed
and
there
was
great
joy
in
that
city
but
there
was
a
certain
man
called
simon
which
beforetime
in
the
same
city
used
sorcery
and
bewitched
the
people
of
samaria
giving
out
that
himself
was
some
great
one
to
whom
they
all
gave
heed
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
saying
this
man
is
the
great
power
of
god
and
to
him
they
had
regard
because
that
of
long
time
he
had
bewitched
them
with
sorceries
but
when
they
believed
philip
preaching
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
name
of
jesus
christ
they
were
baptized
both
men
and
women
then
simon
himself
believed
also
and
when
he
was
baptized
he
continued
with
philip
and
wondered
beholding
the
miracles
and
signs
which
were
done
now
when
the
apostles
which
were
at
jerusalem
heard
that
samaria
had
received
the
word
of
god
they
sent
unto
them
peter
and
john
who
when
they
were
come
down
prayed
for
them
that
they
might
receive
the
holy
ghost
for
as
yet
he
was
fallen
upon
none
of
them
only
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
then
laid
they
their
hands
on
them
and
they
received
the
holy
ghost
and
when
simon
saw
that
through
laying
on
of
the
apostles
hands
the
holy
ghost
was
given
he
offered
them
money
saying
give
me
also
this
power
that
on
whomsoever
i
lay
hands
he
may
receive
the
holy
ghost
but
peter
said
unto
him
thy
money
perish
with
thee
because
thou
hast
thought
that
the
gift
of
god
may
be
purchased
with
money
thou
hast
neither
part
nor
lot
in
this
matter
for
thy
heart
is
not
right
in
the
sight
of
god
repent
therefore
of
this
thy
wickedness
and
pray
god
if
perhaps
the
thought
of
thine
heart
may
be
forgiven
thee
for
i
perceive
that
thou
art
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
the
bond
of
iniquity
then
answered
simon
and
said
pray
ye
to
the
lord
for
me
that
none
of
these
things
which
ye
have
spoken
come
upon
me
and
they
when
they
had
testified
and
preached
the
word
of
the
lord
returned
to
jerusalem
and
preached
the
gospel
in
many
villages
of
the
samaritans
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
philip
saying
arise
and
go
toward
the
south
unto
the
way
that
goeth
down
from
jerusalem
unto
gaza
which
is
desert
and
he
arose
and
went
and
behold
a
man
of
ethiopia
an
eunuch
of
great
authority
under
candace
queen
of
the
ethiopians
who
had
the
charge
of
all
her
treasure
and
had
come
to
jerusalem
for
to
worship
was
returning
and
sitting
in
his
chariot
read
esaias
the
prophet
then
the
spirit
said
unto
philip
go
near
and
join
thyself
to
this
chariot
and
philip
ran
thither
to
him
and
heard
him
read
the
prophet
esaias
and
said
understandest
thou
what
thou
readest
and
he
said
how
can
i
except
some
man
should
guide
me
and
he
desired
philip
that
he
would
come
up
and
sit
with
him
the
place
of
the
scripture
which
he
read
was
this
he
was
led
as
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
and
like
a
lamb
dumb
before
his
shearer
so
opened
he
not
his
mouth
in
his
humiliation
his
judgment
was
taken
away
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
his
life
is
taken
from
the
earth
and
the
eunuch
answered
philip
and
said
i
pray
thee
of
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
this
of
himself
or
of
some
other
man
then
philip
opened
his
mouth
and
began
at
the
same
scripture
and
preached
unto
him
jesus
and
as
they
went
on
their
way
they
came
unto
a
certain
water
and
the
eunuch
said
see
here
is
water
what
doth
hinder
me
to
be
baptized
and
philip
said
if
thou
believest
with
all
thine
heart
thou
mayest
and
he
answered
and
said
i
believe
that
jesus
christ
is
the
son
of
god
and
he
commanded
the
chariot
to
stand
still
and
they
went
down
both
into
the
water
both
philip
and
the
eunuch
and
he
baptized
him
and
when
they
were
come
up
out
of
the
water
the
spirit
of
the
lord
caught
away
philip
that
the
eunuch
saw
him
no
more
and
he
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
but
philip
was
found
at
azotus
and
passing
through
he
preached
in
all
the
cities
till
he
came
to
caesarea
and
saul
yet
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
against
the
disciples
of
the
lord
went
unto
the
high
priest
and
desired
of
him
letters
to
damascus
to
the
synagogues
that
if
he
found
any
of
this
way
whether
they
were
men
or
women
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
jerusalem
and
as
he
journeyed
he
came
near
damascus
and
suddenly
there
shined
round
about
him
a
light
from
heaven
and
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
him
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
and
he
said
who
art
thou
lord
and
the
lord
said
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
and
he
trembling
and
astonished
said
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
and
go
into
the
city
and
it
shall
be
told
thee
what
thou
must
do
and
the
men
which
journeyed
with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
a
voice
but
seeing
no
man
and
saul
arose
from
the
earth
and
when
his
eyes
were
opened
he
saw
no
man
but
they
led
him
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
into
damascus
and
he
was
three
days
without
sight
and
neither
did
eat
nor
drink
and
there
was
a
certain
disciple
at
damascus
named
ananias
and
to
him
said
the
lord
in
a
vision
ananias
and
he
said
behold
i
am
here
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
and
go
into
the
street
which
is
called
straight
and
enquire
in
the
house
of
judas
for
one
called
saul
of
tarsus
for
behold
he
prayeth
and
hath
seen
in
a
vision
a
man
named
ananias
coming
in
and
putting
his
hand
on
him
that
he
might
receive
his
sight
then
ananias
answered
lord
i
have
heard
by
many
of
this
man
how
much
evil
he
hath
done
to
thy
saints
at
jerusalem
and
here
he
hath
authority
from
the
chief
priests
to
bind
all
that
call
on
thy
name
but
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
thy
way
for
he
is
a
chosen
vessel
unto
me
to
bear
my
name
before
the
gentiles
and
kings
and
the
children
of
israel
for
i
will
shew
him
how
great
things
he
must
suffer
for
my
name's
sake
and
ananias
went
his
way
and
entered
into
the
house
and
putting
his
hands
on
him
said
brother
saul
the
lord
even
jesus
that
appeared
unto
thee
in
the
way
as
thou
camest
hath
sent
me
that
thou
mightest
receive
thy
sight
and
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
immediately
there
fell
from
his
eyes
as
it
had
been
scales
and
he
received
sight
forthwith
and
arose
and
was
baptized
and
when
he
had
received
meat
he
was
strengthened
then
was
saul
certain
days
with
the
disciples
which
were
at
damascus
and
straightway
he
preached
christ
in
the
synagogues
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
but
all
that
heard
him
were
amazed
and
said
is
not
this
he
that
destroyed
them
which
called
on
this
name
in
jerusalem
and
came
hither
for
that
intent
that
he
might
bring
them
bound
unto
the
chief
priests
but
saul
increased
the
more
in
strength
and
confounded
the
jews
which
dwelt
at
damascus
proving
that
this
is
very
christ
and
after
that
many
days
were
fulfilled
the
jews
took
counsel
to
kill
him
but
their
laying
await
was
known
of
saul
and
they
watched
the
gates
day
and
night
to
kill
him
then
the
disciples
took
him
by
night
and
let
him
down
by
the
wall
in
a
basket
and
when
saul
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
assayed
to
join
himself
to
the
disciples
but
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
and
believed
not
that
he
was
a
disciple
but
barnabas
took
him
and
brought
him
to
the
apostles
and
declared
unto
them
how
he
had
seen
the
lord
in
the
way
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
and
how
he
had
preached
boldly
at
damascus
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
he
was
with
them
coming
in
and
going
out
at
jerusalem
and
he
spake
boldly
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
disputed
against
the
grecians
but
they
went
about
to
slay
him
which
when
the
brethren
knew
they
brought
him
down
to
caesarea
and
sent
him
forth
to
tarsus
then
had
the
churches
rest
throughout
all
judaea
and
galilee
and
samaria
and
were
edified
and
walking
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
in
the
comfort
of
the
holy
ghost
were
multiplied
and
it
came
to
pass
as
peter
passed
throughout
all
quarters
he
came
down
also
to
the
saints
which
dwelt
at
lydda
and
there
he
found
a
certain
man
named
aeneas
which
had
kept
his
bed
eight
years
and
was
sick
of
the
palsy
and
peter
said
unto
him
aeneas
jesus
christ
maketh
thee
whole
arise
and
make
thy
bed
and
he
arose
immediately
and
all
that
dwelt
at
lydda
and
saron
saw
him
and
turned
to
the
lord
now
there
was
at
joppa
a
certain
disciple
named
tabitha
which
by
interpretation
is
called
dorcas
this
woman
was
full
of
good
works
and
almsdeeds
which
she
did
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
she
was
sick
and
died
whom
when
they
had
washed
they
laid
her
in
an
upper
chamber
and
forasmuch
as
lydda
was
nigh
to
joppa
and
the
disciples
had
heard
that
peter
was
there
they
sent
unto
him
two
men
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
delay
to
come
to
them
then
peter
arose
and
went
with
them
when
he
was
come
they
brought
him
into
the
upper
chamber
and
all
the
widows
stood
by
him
weeping
and
shewing
the
coats
and
garments
which
dorcas
made
while
she
was
with
them
but
peter
put
them
all
forth
and
kneeled
down
and
prayed
and
turning
him
to
the
body
said
tabitha
arise
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
peter
she
sat
up
and
he
gave
her
his
hand
and
lifted
her
up
and
when
he
had
called
the
saints
and
widows
presented
her
alive
and
it
was
known
throughout
all
joppa
and
many
believed
in
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
tarried
many
days
in
joppa
with
one
simon
a
tanner
there
was
a
certain
man
in
caesarea
called
cornelius
a
centurion
of
the
band
called
the
italian
band
a
devout
man
and
one
that
feared
god
with
all
his
house
which
gave
much
alms
to
the
people
and
prayed
to
god
alway
he
saw
in
a
vision
evidently
about
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day
an
angel
of
god
coming
in
to
him
and
saying
unto
him
cornelius
and
when
he
looked
on
him
he
was
afraid
and
said
what
is
it
lord
and
he
said
unto
him
thy
prayers
and
thine
alms
are
come
up
for
a
memorial
before
god
and
now
send
men
to
joppa
and
call
for
one
simon
whose
surname
is
peter
he
lodgeth
with
one
simon
a
tanner
whose
house
is
by
the
sea
side
he
shall
tell
thee
what
thou
oughtest
to
do
and
when
the
angel
which
spake
unto
cornelius
was
departed
he
called
two
of
his
household
servants
and
a
devout
soldier
of
them
that
waited
on
him
continually
and
when
he
had
declared
all
these
things
unto
them
he
sent
them
to
joppa
on
the
morrow
as
they
went
on
their
journey
and
drew
nigh
unto
the
city
peter
went
up
upon
the
housetop
to
pray
about
the
sixth
hour
and
he
became
very
hungry
and
would
have
eaten
but
while
they
made
ready
he
fell
into
a
trance
and
saw
heaven
opened
and
a
certain
vessel
descending
upon
him
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
knit
at
the
four
corners
and
let
down
to
the
earth
wherein
were
all
manner
of
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth
and
wild
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
fowls
of
the
air
and
there
came
a
voice
to
him
rise
peter
kill
and
eat
but
peter
said
not
so
lord
for
i
have
never
eaten
any
thing
that
is
common
or
unclean
and
the
voice
spake
unto
him
again
the
second
time
what
god
hath
cleansed
that
call
not
thou
common
this
was
done
thrice
and
the
vessel
was
received
up
again
into
heaven
now
while
peter
doubted
in
himself
what
this
vision
which
he
had
seen
should
mean
behold
the
men
which
were
sent
from
cornelius
had
made
enquiry
for
simon's
house
and
stood
before
the
gate
and
called
and
asked
whether
simon
which
was
surnamed
peter
were
lodged
there
while
peter
thought
on
the
vision
the
spirit
said
unto
him
behold
three
men
seek
thee
arise
therefore
and
get
thee
down
and
go
with
them
doubting
nothing
for
i
have
sent
them
then
peter
went
down
to
the
men
which
were
sent
unto
him
from
cornelius
and
said
behold
i
am
he
whom
ye
seek
what
is
the
cause
wherefore
ye
are
come
and
they
said
cornelius
the
centurion
a
just
man
and
one
that
feareth
god
and
of
good
report
among
all
the
nation
of
the
jews
was
warned
from
god
by
an
holy
angel
to
send
for
thee
into
his
house
and
to
hear
words
of
thee
then
called
he
them
in
and
lodged
them
and
on
the
morrow
peter
went
away
with
them
and
certain
brethren
from
joppa
accompanied
him
and
the
morrow
after
they
entered
into
caesarea
and
cornelius
waited
for
them
and
he
had
called
together
his
kinsmen
and
near
friends
and
as
peter
was
coming
in
cornelius
met
him
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
worshipped
him
but
peter
took
him
up
saying
stand
up
i
myself
also
am
a
man
and
as
he
talked
with
him
he
went
in
and
found
many
that
were
come
together
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
how
that
it
is
an
unlawful
thing
for
a
man
that
is
a
jew
to
keep
company
or
come
unto
one
of
another
nation
but
god
hath
shewed
me
that
i
should
not
call
any
man
common
or
unclean
therefore
came
i
unto
you
without
gainsaying
as
soon
as
i
was
sent
for
i
ask
therefore
for
what
intent
ye
have
sent
for
me
and
cornelius
said
four
days
ago
i
was
fasting
until
this
hour
and
at
the
ninth
hour
i
prayed
in
my
house
and
behold
a
man
stood
before
me
in
bright
clothing
and
said
cornelius
thy
prayer
is
heard
and
thine
alms
are
had
in
remembrance
in
the
sight
of
god
send
therefore
to
joppa
and
call
hither
simon
whose
surname
is
peter
he
is
lodged
in
the
house
of
one
simon
a
tanner
by
the
sea
side
who
when
he
cometh
shall
speak
unto
thee
immediately
therefore
i
sent
to
thee
and
thou
hast
well
done
that
thou
art
come
now
therefore
are
we
all
here
present
before
god
to
hear
all
things
that
are
commanded
thee
of
god
then
peter
opened
his
mouth
and
said
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
but
in
every
nation
he
that
feareth
him
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
with
him
the
word
which
god
sent
unto
the
children
of
israel
preaching
peace
by
jesus
christ
he
is
lord
of
all
that
word
i
say
ye
know
which
was
published
throughout
all
judaea
and
began
from
galilee
after
the
baptism
which
john
preached
how
god
anointed
jesus
of
nazareth
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
power
who
went
about
doing
good
and
healing
all
that
were
oppressed
of
the
devil
for
god
was
with
him
and
we
are
witnesses
of
all
things
which
he
did
both
in
the
land
of
the
jews
and
in
jerusalem
whom
they
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
him
god
raised
up
the
third
day
and
shewed
him
openly
not
to
all
the
people
but
unto
witnesses
chosen
before
god
even
to
us
who
did
eat
and
drink
with
him
after
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
he
commanded
us
to
preach
unto
the
people
and
to
testify
that
it
is
he
which
was
ordained
of
god
to
be
the
judge
of
quick
and
dead
to
him
give
all
the
prophets
witness
that
through
his
name
whosoever
believeth
in
him
shall
receive
remission
of
sins
while
peter
yet
spake
these
words
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
all
them
which
heard
the
word
and
they
of
the
circumcision
which
believed
were
astonished
as
many
as
came
with
peter
because
that
on
the
gentiles
also
was
poured
out
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
for
they
heard
them
speak
with
tongues
and
magnify
god
then
answered
peter
can
any
man
forbid
water
that
these
should
not
be
baptized
which
have
received
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
we
and
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
then
prayed
they
him
to
tarry
certain
days
and
the
apostles
and
brethren
that
were
in
judaea
heard
that
the
gentiles
had
also
received
the
word
of
god
and
when
peter
was
come
up
to
jerusalem
they
that
were
of
the
circumcision
contended
with
him
saying
thou
wentest
in
to
men
uncircumcised
and
didst
eat
with
them
but
peter
rehearsed
the
matter
from
the
beginning
and
expounded
it
by
order
unto
them
saying
i
was
in
the
city
of
joppa
praying
and
in
a
trance
i
saw
a
vision
a
certain
vessel
descend
as
it
had
been
a
great
sheet
let
down
from
heaven
by
four
corners
and
it
came
even
to
me
upon
the
which
when
i
had
fastened
mine
eyes
i
considered
and
saw
fourfooted
beasts
of
the
earth
and
wild
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
fowls
of
the
air
and
i
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me
arise
peter
slay
and
eat
but
i
said
not
so
lord
for
nothing
common
or
unclean
hath
at
any
time
entered
into
my
mouth
but
the
voice
answered
me
again
from
heaven
what
god
hath
cleansed
that
call
not
thou
common
and
this
was
done
three
times
and
all
were
drawn
up
again
into
heaven
and
behold
immediately
there
were
three
men
already
come
unto
the
house
where
i
was
sent
from
caesarea
unto
me
and
the
spirit
bade
me
go
with
them
nothing
doubting
moreover
these
six
brethren
accompanied
me
and
we
entered
into
the
man's
house
and
he
shewed
us
how
he
had
seen
an
angel
in
his
house
which
stood
and
said
unto
him
send
men
to
joppa
and
call
for
simon
whose
surname
is
peter
who
shall
tell
thee
words
whereby
thou
and
all
thy
house
shall
be
saved
and
as
i
began
to
speak
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
them
as
on
us
at
the
beginning
then
remembered
i
the
word
of
the
lord
how
that
he
said
john
indeed
baptized
with
water
but
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
ghost
forasmuch
then
as
god
gave
them
the
like
gift
as
he
did
unto
us
who
believed
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
what
was
i
that
i
could
withstand
god
when
they
heard
these
things
they
held
their
peace
and
glorified
god
saying
then
hath
god
also
to
the
gentiles
granted
repentance
unto
life
now
they
which
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
persecution
that
arose
about
stephen
travelled
as
far
as
phenice
and
cyprus
and
antioch
preaching
the
word
to
none
but
unto
the
jews
only
and
some
of
them
were
men
of
cyprus
and
cyrene
which
when
they
were
come
to
antioch
spake
unto
the
grecians
preaching
the
lord
jesus
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
with
them
and
a
great
number
believed
and
turned
unto
the
lord
then
tidings
of
these
things
came
unto
the
ears
of
the
church
which
was
in
jerusalem
and
they
sent
forth
barnabas
that
he
should
go
as
far
as
antioch
who
when
he
came
and
had
seen
the
grace
of
god
was
glad
and
exhorted
them
all
that
with
purpose
of
heart
they
would
cleave
unto
the
lord
for
he
was
a
good
man
and
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
faith
and
much
people
was
added
unto
the
lord
then
departed
barnabas
to
tarsus
for
to
seek
saul
and
when
he
had
found
him
he
brought
him
unto
antioch
and
it
came
to
pass
that
a
whole
year
they
assembled
themselves
with
the
church
and
taught
much
people
and
the
disciples
were
called
christians
first
in
antioch
and
in
these
days
came
prophets
from
jerusalem
unto
antioch
and
there
stood
up
one
of
them
named
agabus
and
signified
by
the
spirit
that
there
should
be
great
dearth
throughout
all
the
world
which
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
claudius
caesar
then
the
disciples
every
man
according
to
his
ability
determined
to
send
relief
unto
the
brethren
which
dwelt
in
judaea
which
also
they
did
and
sent
it
to
the
elders
by
the
hands
of
barnabas
and
saul
now
about
that
time
herod
the
king
stretched
forth
his
hands
to
vex
certain
of
the
church
and
he
killed
james
the
brother
of
john
with
the
sword
and
because
he
saw
it
pleased
the
jews
he
proceeded
further
to
take
peter
also
then
were
the
days
of
unleavened
bread
and
when
he
had
apprehended
him
he
put
him
in
prison
and
delivered
him
to
four
quaternions
of
soldiers
to
keep
him
intending
after
easter
to
bring
him
forth
to
the
people
peter
therefore
was
kept
in
prison
but
prayer
was
made
without
ceasing
of
the
church
unto
god
for
him
and
when
herod
would
have
brought
him
forth
the
same
night
peter
was
sleeping
between
two
soldiers
bound
with
two
chains
and
the
keepers
before
the
door
kept
the
prison
and
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
a
light
shined
in
the
prison
and
he
smote
peter
on
the
side
and
raised
him
up
saying
arise
up
quickly
and
his
chains
fell
off
from
his
hands
and
the
angel
said
unto
him
gird
thyself
and
bind
on
thy
sandals
and
so
he
did
and
he
saith
unto
him
cast
thy
garment
about
thee
and
follow
me
and
he
went
out
and
followed
him
and
wist
not
that
it
was
true
which
was
done
by
the
angel
but
thought
he
saw
a
vision
when
they
were
past
the
first
and
the
second
ward
they
came
unto
the
iron
gate
that
leadeth
unto
the
city
which
opened
to
them
of
his
own
accord
and
they
went
out
and
passed
on
through
one
street
and
forthwith
the
angel
departed
from
him
and
when
peter
was
come
to
himself
he
said
now
i
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
sent
his
angel
and
hath
delivered
me
out
of
the
hand
of
herod
and
from
all
the
expectation
of
the
people
of
the
jews
and
when
he
had
considered
the
thing
he
came
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
john
whose
surname
was
mark
where
many
were
gathered
together
praying
and
as
peter
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
gate
a
damsel
came
to
hearken
named
rhoda
and
when
she
knew
peter's
voice
she
opened
not
the
gate
for
gladness
but
ran
in
and
told
how
peter
stood
before
the
gate
and
they
said
unto
her
thou
art
mad
but
she
constantly
affirmed
that
it
was
even
so
then
said
they
it
is
his
angel
but
peter
continued
knocking
and
when
they
had
opened
the
door
and
saw
him
they
were
astonished
but
he
beckoning
unto
them
with
the
hand
to
hold
their
peace
declared
unto
them
how
the
lord
had
brought
him
out
of
the
prison
and
he
said
go
shew
these
things
unto
james
and
to
the
brethren
and
he
departed
and
went
into
another
place
now
as
soon
as
it
was
day
there
was
no
small
stir
among
the
soldiers
what
was
become
of
peter
and
when
herod
had
sought
for
him
and
found
him
not
he
examined
the
keepers
and
commanded
that
they
should
be
put
to
death
and
he
went
down
from
judaea
to
caesarea
and
there
abode
and
herod
was
highly
displeased
with
them
of
tyre
and
sidon
but
they
came
with
one
accord
to
him
and
having
made
blastus
the
king's
chamberlain
their
friend
desired
peace
because
their
country
was
nourished
by
the
king's
country
and
upon
a
set
day
herod
arrayed
in
royal
apparel
sat
upon
his
throne
and
made
an
oration
unto
them
and
the
people
gave
a
shout
saying
it
is
the
voice
of
a
god
and
not
of
a
man
and
immediately
the
angel
of
the
lord
smote
him
because
he
gave
not
god
the
glory
and
he
was
eaten
of
worms
and
gave
up
the
ghost
but
the
word
of
god
grew
and
multiplied
and
barnabas
and
saul
returned
from
jerusalem
when
they
had
fulfilled
their
ministry
and
took
with
them
john
whose
surname
was
mark
now
there
were
in
the
church
that
was
at
antioch
certain
prophets
and
teachers
as
barnabas
and
simeon
that
was
called
niger
and
lucius
of
cyrene
and
manaen
which
had
been
brought
up
with
herod
the
tetrarch
and
saul
as
they
ministered
to
the
lord
and
fasted
the
holy
ghost
said
separate
me
barnabas
and
saul
for
the
work
whereunto
i
have
called
them
and
when
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
laid
their
hands
on
them
they
sent
them
away
so
they
being
sent
forth
by
the
holy
ghost
departed
unto
seleucia
and
from
thence
they
sailed
to
cyprus
and
when
they
were
at
salamis
they
preached
the
word
of
god
in
the
synagogues
of
the
jews
and
they
had
also
john
to
their
minister
and
when
they
had
gone
through
the
isle
unto
paphos
they
found
a
certain
sorcerer
a
false
prophet
a
jew
whose
name
was
barjesus
which
was
with
the
deputy
of
the
country
sergius
paulus
a
prudent
man
who
called
for
barnabas
and
saul
and
desired
to
hear
the
word
of
god
but
elymas
the
sorcerer
for
so
is
his
name
by
interpretation
withstood
them
seeking
to
turn
away
the
deputy
from
the
faith
then
saul
who
also
is
called
paul
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
set
his
eyes
on
him
and
said
o
full
of
all
subtilty
and
all
mischief
thou
child
of
the
devil
thou
enemy
of
all
righteousness
wilt
thou
not
cease
to
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
and
now
behold
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
blind
not
seeing
the
sun
for
a
season
and
immediately
there
fell
on
him
a
mist
and
a
darkness
and
he
went
about
seeking
some
to
lead
him
by
the
hand
then
the
deputy
when
he
saw
what
was
done
believed
being
astonished
at
the
doctrine
of
the
lord
now
when
paul
and
his
company
loosed
from
paphos
they
came
to
perga
in
pamphylia
and
john
departing
from
them
returned
to
jerusalem
but
when
they
departed
from
perga
they
came
to
antioch
in
pisidia
and
went
into
the
synagogue
on
the
sabbath
day
and
sat
down
and
after
the
reading
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
the
rulers
of
the
synagogue
sent
unto
them
saying
ye
men
and
brethren
if
ye
have
any
word
of
exhortation
for
the
people
say
on
then
paul
stood
up
and
beckoning
with
his
hand
said
men
of
israel
and
ye
that
fear
god
give
audience
the
god
of
this
people
of
israel
chose
our
fathers
and
exalted
the
people
when
they
dwelt
as
strangers
in
the
land
of
egypt
and
with
an
high
arm
brought
he
them
out
of
it
and
about
the
time
of
forty
years
suffered
he
their
manners
in
the
wilderness
and
when
he
had
destroyed
seven
nations
in
the
land
of
chanaan
he
divided
their
land
to
them
by
lot
and
after
that
he
gave
unto
them
judges
about
the
space
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
until
samuel
the
prophet
and
afterward
they
desired
a
king
and
god
gave
unto
them
saul
the
son
of
cis
a
man
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
by
the
space
of
forty
years
and
when
he
had
removed
him
he
raised
up
unto
them
david
to
be
their
king
to
whom
also
he
gave
their
testimony
and
said
i
have
found
david
the
son
of
jesse
a
man
after
mine
own
heart
which
shall
fulfil
all
my
will
of
this
man's
seed
hath
god
according
to
his
promise
raised
unto
israel
a
saviour
jesus
when
john
had
first
preached
before
his
coming
the
baptism
of
repentance
to
all
the
people
of
israel
and
as
john
fulfilled
his
course
he
said
whom
think
ye
that
i
am
i
am
not
he
but
behold
there
cometh
one
after
me
whose
shoes
of
his
feet
i
am
not
worthy
to
loose
men
and
brethren
children
of
the
stock
of
abraham
and
whosoever
among
you
feareth
god
to
you
is
the
word
of
this
salvation
sent
for
they
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
and
their
rulers
because
they
knew
him
not
nor
yet
the
voices
of
the
prophets
which
are
read
every
sabbath
day
they
have
fulfilled
them
in
condemning
him
and
though
they
found
no
cause
of
death
in
him
yet
desired
they
pilate
that
he
should
be
slain
and
when
they
had
fulfilled
all
that
was
written
of
him
they
took
him
down
from
the
tree
and
laid
him
in
a
sepulchre
but
god
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
he
was
seen
many
days
of
them
which
came
up
with
him
from
galilee
to
jerusalem
who
are
his
witnesses
unto
the
people
and
we
declare
unto
you
glad
tidings
how
that
the
promise
which
was
made
unto
the
fathers
god
hath
fulfilled
the
same
unto
us
their
children
in
that
he
hath
raised
up
jesus
again
as
it
is
also
written
in
the
second
psalm
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
and
as
concerning
that
he
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
now
no
more
to
return
to
corruption
he
said
on
this
wise
i
will
give
you
the
sure
mercies
of
david
wherefore
he
saith
also
in
another
psalm
thou
shalt
not
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
for
david
after
he
had
served
his
own
generation
by
the
will
of
god
fell
on
sleep
and
was
laid
unto
his
fathers
and
saw
corruption
but
he
whom
god
raised
again
saw
no
corruption
be
it
known
unto
you
therefore
men
and
brethren
that
through
this
man
is
preached
unto
you
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
moses
beware
therefore
lest
that
come
upon
you
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
prophets
behold
ye
despisers
and
wonder
and
perish
for
i
work
a
work
in
your
days
a
work
which
ye
shall
in
no
wise
believe
though
a
man
declare
it
unto
you
and
when
the
jews
were
gone
out
of
the
synagogue
the
gentiles
besought
that
these
words
might
be
preached
to
them
the
next
sabbath
now
when
the
congregation
was
broken
up
many
of
the
jews
and
religious
proselytes
followed
paul
and
barnabas
who
speaking
to
them
persuaded
them
to
continue
in
the
grace
of
god
and
the
next
sabbath
day
came
almost
the
whole
city
together
to
hear
the
word
of
god
but
when
the
jews
saw
the
multitudes
they
were
filled
with
envy
and
spake
against
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
paul
contradicting
and
blaspheming
then
paul
and
barnabas
waxed
bold
and
said
it
was
necessary
that
the
word
of
god
should
first
have
been
spoken
to
you
but
seeing
ye
put
it
from
you
and
judge
yourselves
unworthy
of
everlasting
life
lo
we
turn
to
the
gentiles
for
so
hath
the
lord
commanded
us
saying
i
have
set
thee
to
be
a
light
of
the
gentiles
that
thou
shouldest
be
for
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
when
the
gentiles
heard
this
they
were
glad
and
glorified
the
word
of
the
lord
and
as
many
as
were
ordained
to
eternal
life
believed
and
the
word
of
the
lord
was
published
throughout
all
the
region
but
the
jews
stirred
up
the
devout
and
honourable
women
and
the
chief
men
of
the
city
and
raised
persecution
against
paul
and
barnabas
and
expelled
them
out
of
their
coasts
but
they
shook
off
the
dust
of
their
feet
against
them
and
came
unto
iconium
and
the
disciples
were
filled
with
joy
and
with
the
holy
ghost
and
it
came
to
pass
in
iconium
that
they
went
both
together
into
the
synagogue
of
the
jews
and
so
spake
that
a
great
multitude
both
of
the
jews
and
also
of
the
greeks
believed
but
the
unbelieving
jews
stirred
up
the
gentiles
and
made
their
minds
evil
affected
against
the
brethren
long
time
therefore
abode
they
speaking
boldly
in
the
lord
which
gave
testimony
unto
the
word
of
his
grace
and
granted
signs
and
wonders
to
be
done
by
their
hands
but
the
multitude
of
the
city
was
divided
and
part
held
with
the
jews
and
part
with
the
apostles
and
when
there
was
an
assault
made
both
of
the
gentiles
and
also
of
the
jews
with
their
rulers
to
use
them
despitefully
and
to
stone
them
they
were
ware
of
it
and
fled
unto
lystra
and
derbe
cities
of
lycaonia
and
unto
the
region
that
lieth
round
about
and
there
they
preached
the
gospel
and
there
sat
a
certain
man
at
lystra
impotent
in
his
feet
being
a
cripple
from
his
mother's
womb
who
never
had
walked
the
same
heard
paul
speak
who
stedfastly
beholding
him
and
perceiving
that
he
had
faith
to
be
healed
said
with
a
loud
voice
stand
upright
on
thy
feet
and
he
leaped
and
walked
and
when
the
people
saw
what
paul
had
done
they
lifted
up
their
voices
saying
in
the
speech
of
lycaonia
the
gods
are
come
down
to
us
in
the
likeness
of
men
and
they
called
barnabas
jupiter
and
paul
mercurius
because
he
was
the
chief
speaker
then
the
priest
of
jupiter
which
was
before
their
city
brought
oxen
and
garlands
unto
the
gates
and
would
have
done
sacrifice
with
the
people
which
when
the
apostles
barnabas
and
paul
heard
of
they
rent
their
clothes
and
ran
in
among
the
people
crying
out
and
saying
sirs
why
do
ye
these
things
we
also
are
men
of
like
passions
with
you
and
preach
unto
you
that
ye
should
turn
from
these
vanities
unto
the
living
god
which
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
things
that
are
therein
who
in
times
past
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
ways
nevertheless
he
left
not
himself
without
witness
in
that
he
did
good
and
gave
us
rain
from
heaven
and
fruitful
seasons
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
gladness
and
with
these
sayings
scarce
restrained
they
the
people
that
they
had
not
done
sacrifice
unto
them
and
there
came
thither
certain
jews
from
antioch
and
iconium
who
persuaded
the
people
and
having
stoned
paul
drew
him
out
of
the
city
supposing
he
had
been
dead
howbeit
as
the
disciples
stood
round
about
him
he
rose
up
and
came
into
the
city
and
the
next
day
he
departed
with
barnabas
to
derbe
and
when
they
had
preached
the
gospel
to
that
city
and
had
taught
many
they
returned
again
to
lystra
and
to
iconium
and
antioch
confirming
the
souls
of
the
disciples
and
exhorting
them
to
continue
in
the
faith
and
that
we
must
through
much
tribulation
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
and
when
they
had
ordained
them
elders
in
every
church
and
had
prayed
with
fasting
they
commended
them
to
the
lord
on
whom
they
believed
and
after
they
had
passed
throughout
pisidia
they
came
to
pamphylia
and
when
they
had
preached
the
word
in
perga
they
went
down
into
attalia
and
thence
sailed
to
antioch
from
whence
they
had
been
recommended
to
the
grace
of
god
for
the
work
which
they
fulfilled
and
when
they
were
come
and
had
gathered
the
church
together
they
rehearsed
all
that
god
had
done
with
them
and
how
he
had
opened
the
door
of
faith
unto
the
gentiles
and
there
they
abode
long
time
with
the
disciples
and
certain
men
which
came
down
from
judaea
taught
the
brethren
and
said
except
ye
be
circumcised
after
the
manner
of
moses
ye
cannot
be
saved
when
therefore
paul
and
barnabas
had
no
small
dissension
and
disputation
with
them
they
determined
that
paul
and
barnabas
and
certain
other
of
them
should
go
up
to
jerusalem
unto
the
apostles
and
elders
about
this
question
and
being
brought
on
their
way
by
the
church
they
passed
through
phenice
and
samaria
declaring
the
conversion
of
the
gentiles
and
they
caused
great
joy
unto
all
the
brethren
and
when
they
were
come
to
jerusalem
they
were
received
of
the
church
and
of
the
apostles
and
elders
and
they
declared
all
things
that
god
had
done
with
them
but
there
rose
up
certain
of
the
sect
of
the
pharisees
which
believed
saying
that
it
was
needful
to
circumcise
them
and
to
command
them
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
the
apostles
and
elders
came
together
for
to
consider
of
this
matter
and
when
there
had
been
much
disputing
peter
rose
up
and
said
unto
them
men
and
brethren
ye
know
how
that
a
good
while
ago
god
made
choice
among
us
that
the
gentiles
by
my
mouth
should
hear
the
word
of
the
gospel
and
believe
and
god
which
knoweth
the
hearts
bare
them
witness
giving
them
the
holy
ghost
even
as
he
did
unto
us
and
put
no
difference
between
us
and
them
purifying
their
hearts
by
faith
now
therefore
why
tempt
ye
god
to
put
a
yoke
upon
the
neck
of
the
disciples
which
neither
our
fathers
nor
we
were
able
to
bear
but
we
believe
that
through
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
we
shall
be
saved
even
as
they
then
all
the
multitude
kept
silence
and
gave
audience
to
barnabas
and
paul
declaring
what
miracles
and
wonders
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
them
and
after
they
had
held
their
peace
james
answered
saying
men
and
brethren
hearken
unto
me
simeon
hath
declared
how
god
at
the
first
did
visit
the
gentiles
to
take
out
of
them
a
people
for
his
name
and
to
this
agree
the
words
of
the
prophets
as
it
is
written
after
this
i
will
return
and
will
build
again
the
tabernacle
of
david
which
is
fallen
down
and
i
will
build
again
the
ruins
thereof
and
i
will
set
it
up
that
the
residue
of
men
might
seek
after
the
lord
and
all
the
gentiles
upon
whom
my
name
is
called
saith
the
lord
who
doeth
all
these
things
known
unto
god
are
all
his
works
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
wherefore
my
sentence
is
that
we
trouble
not
them
which
from
among
the
gentiles
are
turned
to
god
but
that
we
write
unto
them
that
they
abstain
from
pollutions
of
idols
and
from
fornication
and
from
things
strangled
and
from
blood
for
moses
of
old
time
hath
in
every
city
them
that
preach
him
being
read
in
the
synagogues
every
sabbath
day
then
pleased
it
the
apostles
and
elders
with
the
whole
church
to
send
chosen
men
of
their
own
company
to
antioch
with
paul
and
barnabas
namely
judas
surnamed
barsabas
and
silas
chief
men
among
the
brethren
and
they
wrote
letters
by
them
after
this
manner
the
apostles
and
elders
and
brethren
send
greeting
unto
the
brethren
which
are
of
the
gentiles
in
antioch
and
syria
and
cilicia
forasmuch
as
we
have
heard
that
certain
which
went
out
from
us
have
troubled
you
with
words
subverting
your
souls
saying
ye
must
be
circumcised
and
keep
the
law
to
whom
we
gave
no
such
commandment
it
seemed
good
unto
us
being
assembled
with
one
accord
to
send
chosen
men
unto
you
with
our
beloved
barnabas
and
paul
men
that
have
hazarded
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
we
have
sent
therefore
judas
and
silas
who
shall
also
tell
you
the
same
things
by
mouth
for
it
seemed
good
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
us
to
lay
upon
you
no
greater
burden
than
these
necessary
things
that
ye
abstain
from
meats
offered
to
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
things
strangled
and
from
fornication
from
which
if
ye
keep
yourselves
ye
shall
do
well
fare
ye
well
so
when
they
were
dismissed
they
came
to
antioch
and
when
they
had
gathered
the
multitude
together
they
delivered
the
epistle
which
when
they
had
read
they
rejoiced
for
the
consolation
and
judas
and
silas
being
prophets
also
themselves
exhorted
the
brethren
with
many
words
and
confirmed
them
and
after
they
had
tarried
there
a
space
they
were
let
go
in
peace
from
the
brethren
unto
the
apostles
notwithstanding
it
pleased
silas
to
abide
there
still
paul
also
and
barnabas
continued
in
antioch
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
of
the
lord
with
many
others
also
and
some
days
after
paul
said
unto
barnabas
let
us
go
again
and
visit
our
brethren
in
every
city
where
we
have
preached
the
word
of
the
lord
and
see
how
they
do
and
barnabas
determined
to
take
with
them
john
whose
surname
was
mark
but
paul
thought
not
good
to
take
him
with
them
who
departed
from
them
from
pamphylia
and
went
not
with
them
to
the
work
and
the
contention
was
so
sharp
between
them
that
they
departed
asunder
one
from
the
other
and
so
barnabas
took
mark
and
sailed
unto
cyprus
and
paul
chose
silas
and
departed
being
recommended
by
the
brethren
unto
the
grace
of
god
and
he
went
through
syria
and
cilicia
confirming
the
churches
then
came
he
to
derbe
and
lystra
and
behold
a
certain
disciple
was
there
named
timotheus
the
son
of
a
certain
woman
which
was
a
jewess
and
believed
but
his
father
was
a
greek
which
was
well
reported
of
by
the
brethren
that
were
at
lystra
and
iconium
him
would
paul
have
to
go
forth
with
him
and
took
and
circumcised
him
because
of
the
jews
which
were
in
those
quarters
for
they
knew
all
that
his
father
was
a
greek
and
as
they
went
through
the
cities
they
delivered
them
the
decrees
for
to
keep
that
were
ordained
of
the
apostles
and
elders
which
were
at
jerusalem
and
so
were
the
churches
established
in
the
faith
and
increased
in
number
daily
now
when
they
had
gone
throughout
phrygia
and
the
region
of
galatia
and
were
forbidden
of
the
holy
ghost
to
preach
the
word
in
asia
after
they
were
come
to
mysia
they
assayed
to
go
into
bithynia
but
the
spirit
suffered
them
not
and
they
passing
by
mysia
came
down
to
troas
and
a
vision
appeared
to
paul
in
the
night
there
stood
a
man
of
macedonia
and
prayed
him
saying
come
over
into
macedonia
and
help
us
and
after
he
had
seen
the
vision
immediately
we
endeavoured
to
go
into
macedonia
assuredly
gathering
that
the
lord
had
called
us
for
to
preach
the
gospel
unto
them
therefore
loosing
from
troas
we
came
with
a
straight
course
to
samothracia
and
the
next
day
to
neapolis
and
from
thence
to
philippi
which
is
the
chief
city
of
that
part
of
macedonia
and
a
colony
and
we
were
in
that
city
abiding
certain
days
and
on
the
sabbath
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
a
river
side
where
prayer
was
wont
to
be
made
and
we
sat
down
and
spake
unto
the
women
which
resorted
thither
and
a
certain
woman
named
lydia
a
seller
of
purple
of
the
city
of
thyatira
which
worshipped
god
heard
us
whose
heart
the
lord
opened
that
she
attended
unto
the
things
which
were
spoken
of
paul
and
when
she
was
baptized
and
her
household
she
besought
us
saying
if
ye
have
judged
me
to
be
faithful
to
the
lord
come
into
my
house
and
abide
there
and
she
constrained
us
and
it
came
to
pass
as
we
went
to
prayer
a
certain
damsel
possessed
with
a
spirit
of
divination
met
us
which
brought
her
masters
much
gain
by
soothsaying
the
same
followed
paul
and
us
and
cried
saying
these
men
are
the
servants
of
the
most
high
god
which
shew
unto
us
the
way
of
salvation
and
this
did
she
many
days
but
paul
being
grieved
turned
and
said
to
the
spirit
i
command
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
to
come
out
of
her
and
he
came
out
the
same
hour
and
when
her
masters
saw
that
the
hope
of
their
gains
was
gone
they
caught
paul
and
silas
and
drew
them
into
the
marketplace
unto
the
rulers
and
brought
them
to
the
magistrates
saying
these
men
being
jews
do
exceedingly
trouble
our
city
and
teach
customs
which
are
not
lawful
for
us
to
receive
neither
to
observe
being
romans
and
the
multitude
rose
up
together
against
them
and
the
magistrates
rent
off
their
clothes
and
commanded
to
beat
them
and
when
they
had
laid
many
stripes
upon
them
they
cast
them
into
prison
charging
the
jailor
to
keep
them
safely
who
having
received
such
a
charge
thrust
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
made
their
feet
fast
in
the
stocks
and
at
midnight
paul
and
silas
prayed
and
sang
praises
unto
god
and
the
prisoners
heard
them
and
suddenly
there
was
a
great
earthquake
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
prison
were
shaken
and
immediately
all
the
doors
were
opened
and
every
one's
bands
were
loosed
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
awaking
out
of
his
sleep
and
seeing
the
prison
doors
open
he
drew
out
his
sword
and
would
have
killed
himself
supposing
that
the
prisoners
had
been
fled
but
paul
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
do
thyself
no
harm
for
we
are
all
here
then
he
called
for
a
light
and
sprang
in
and
came
trembling
and
fell
down
before
paul
and
silas
and
brought
them
out
and
said
sirs
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
and
they
said
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
thou
shalt
be
saved
and
thy
house
and
they
spake
unto
him
the
word
of
the
lord
and
to
all
that
were
in
his
house
and
he
took
them
the
same
hour
of
the
night
and
washed
their
stripes
and
was
baptized
he
and
all
his
straightway
and
when
he
had
brought
them
into
his
house
he
set
meat
before
them
and
rejoiced
believing
in
god
with
all
his
house
and
when
it
was
day
the
magistrates
sent
the
serjeants
saying
let
those
men
go
and
the
keeper
of
the
prison
told
this
saying
to
paul
the
magistrates
have
sent
to
let
you
go
now
therefore
depart
and
go
in
peace
but
paul
said
unto
them
they
have
beaten
us
openly
uncondemned
being
romans
and
have
cast
us
into
prison
and
now
do
they
thrust
us
out
privily
nay
verily
but
let
them
come
themselves
and
fetch
us
out
and
the
serjeants
told
these
words
unto
the
magistrates
and
they
feared
when
they
heard
that
they
were
romans
and
they
came
and
besought
them
and
brought
them
out
and
desired
them
to
depart
out
of
the
city
and
they
went
out
of
the
prison
and
entered
into
the
house
of
lydia
and
when
they
had
seen
the
brethren
they
comforted
them
and
departed
now
when
they
had
passed
through
amphipolis
and
apollonia
they
came
to
thessalonica
where
was
a
synagogue
of
the
jews
and
paul
as
his
manner
was
went
in
unto
them
and
three
sabbath
days
reasoned
with
them
out
of
the
scriptures
opening
and
alleging
that
christ
must
needs
have
suffered
and
risen
again
from
the
dead
and
that
this
jesus
whom
i
preach
unto
you
is
christ
and
some
of
them
believed
and
consorted
with
paul
and
silas
and
of
the
devout
greeks
a
great
multitude
and
of
the
chief
women
not
a
few
but
the
jews
which
believed
not
moved
with
envy
took
unto
them
certain
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
and
gathered
a
company
and
set
all
the
city
on
an
uproar
and
assaulted
the
house
of
jason
and
sought
to
bring
them
out
to
the
people
and
when
they
found
them
not
they
drew
jason
and
certain
brethren
unto
the
rulers
of
the
city
crying
these
that
have
turned
the
world
upside
down
are
come
hither
also
whom
jason
hath
received
and
these
all
do
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
caesar
saying
that
there
is
another
king
one
jesus
and
they
troubled
the
people
and
the
rulers
of
the
city
when
they
heard
these
things
and
when
they
had
taken
security
of
jason
and
of
the
other
they
let
them
go
and
the
brethren
immediately
sent
away
paul
and
silas
by
night
unto
berea
who
coming
thither
went
into
the
synagogue
of
the
jews
these
were
more
noble
than
those
in
thessalonica
in
that
they
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
of
mind
and
searched
the
scriptures
daily
whether
those
things
were
so
therefore
many
of
them
believed
also
of
honourable
women
which
were
greeks
and
of
men
not
a
few
but
when
the
jews
of
thessalonica
had
knowledge
that
the
word
of
god
was
preached
of
paul
at
berea
they
came
thither
also
and
stirred
up
the
people
and
then
immediately
the
brethren
sent
away
paul
to
go
as
it
were
to
the
sea
but
silas
and
timotheus
abode
there
still
and
they
that
conducted
paul
brought
him
unto
athens
and
receiving
a
commandment
unto
silas
and
timotheus
for
to
come
to
him
with
all
speed
they
departed
now
while
paul
waited
for
them
at
athens
his
spirit
was
stirred
in
him
when
he
saw
the
city
wholly
given
to
idolatry
therefore
disputed
he
in
the
synagogue
with
the
jews
and
with
the
devout
persons
and
in
the
market
daily
with
them
that
met
with
him
then
certain
philosophers
of
the
epicureans
and
of
the
stoicks
encountered
him
and
some
said
what
will
this
babbler
say
other
some
he
seemeth
to
be
a
setter
forth
of
strange
gods
because
he
preached
unto
them
jesus
and
the
resurrection
and
they
took
him
and
brought
him
unto
areopagus
saying
may
we
know
what
this
new
doctrine
whereof
thou
speakest
is
for
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
to
our
ears
we
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
mean
for
all
the
athenians
and
strangers
which
were
there
spent
their
time
in
nothing
else
but
either
to
tell
or
to
hear
some
new
thing
then
paul
stood
in
the
midst
of
mars
hill
and
said
ye
men
of
athens
i
perceive
that
in
all
things
ye
are
too
superstitious
for
as
i
passed
by
and
beheld
your
devotions
i
found
an
altar
with
this
inscription
to
the
unknown
god
whom
therefore
ye
ignorantly
worship
him
declare
i
unto
you
god
that
made
the
world
and
all
things
therein
seeing
that
he
is
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
neither
is
worshipped
with
men's
hands
as
though
he
needed
any
thing
seeing
he
giveth
to
all
life
and
breath
and
all
things
and
hath
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
hath
determined
the
times
before
appointed
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation
that
they
should
seek
the
lord
if
haply
they
might
feel
after
him
and
find
him
though
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
for
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
as
certain
also
of
your
own
poets
have
said
for
we
are
also
his
offspring
forasmuch
then
as
we
are
the
offspring
of
god
we
ought
not
to
think
that
the
godhead
is
like
unto
gold
or
silver
or
stone
graven
by
art
and
man's
device
and
the
times
of
this
ignorance
god
winked
at
but
now
commandeth
all
men
every
where
to
repent
because
he
hath
appointed
a
day
in
the
which
he
will
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
that
man
whom
he
hath
ordained
whereof
he
hath
given
assurance
unto
all
men
in
that
he
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
when
they
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
some
mocked
and
others
said
we
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
matter
so
paul
departed
from
among
them
howbeit
certain
men
clave
unto
him
and
believed
among
the
which
was
dionysius
the
areopagite
and
a
woman
named
damaris
and
others
with
them
after
these
things
paul
departed
from
athens
and
came
to
corinth
and
found
a
certain
jew
named
aquila
born
in
pontus
lately
come
from
italy
with
his
wife
priscilla
because
that
claudius
had
commanded
all
jews
to
depart
from
rome
and
came
unto
them
and
because
he
was
of
the
same
craft
he
abode
with
them
and
wrought
for
by
their
occupation
they
were
tentmakers
and
he
reasoned
in
the
synagogue
every
sabbath
and
persuaded
the
jews
and
the
greeks
and
when
silas
and
timotheus
were
come
from
macedonia
paul
was
pressed
in
the
spirit
and
testified
to
the
jews
that
jesus
was
christ
and
when
they
opposed
themselves
and
blasphemed
he
shook
his
raiment
and
said
unto
them
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
heads
i
am
clean
from
henceforth
i
will
go
unto
the
gentiles
and
he
departed
thence
and
entered
into
a
certain
man's
house
named
justus
one
that
worshipped
god
whose
house
joined
hard
to
the
synagogue
and
crispus
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue
believed
on
the
lord
with
all
his
house
and
many
of
the
corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were
baptized
then
spake
the
lord
to
paul
in
the
night
by
a
vision
be
not
afraid
but
speak
and
hold
not
thy
peace
for
i
am
with
thee
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
thee
for
i
have
much
people
in
this
city
and
he
continued
there
a
year
and
six
months
teaching
the
word
of
god
among
them
and
when
gallio
was
the
deputy
of
achaia
the
jews
made
insurrection
with
one
accord
against
paul
and
brought
him
to
the
judgment
seat
saying
this
fellow
persuadeth
men
to
worship
god
contrary
to
the
law
and
when
paul
was
now
about
to
open
his
mouth
gallio
said
unto
the
jews
if
it
were
a
matter
of
wrong
or
wicked
lewdness
o
ye
jews
reason
would
that
i
should
bear
with
you
but
if
it
be
a
question
of
words
and
names
and
of
your
law
look
ye
to
it
for
i
will
be
no
judge
of
such
matters
and
he
drave
them
from
the
judgment
seat
then
all
the
greeks
took
sosthenes
the
chief
ruler
of
the
synagogue
and
beat
him
before
the
judgment
seat
and
gallio
cared
for
none
of
those
things
and
paul
after
this
tarried
there
yet
a
good
while
and
then
took
his
leave
of
the
brethren
and
sailed
thence
into
syria
and
with
him
priscilla
and
aquila
having
shorn
his
head
in
cenchrea
for
he
had
a
vow
and
he
came
to
ephesus
and
left
them
there
but
he
himself
entered
into
the
synagogue
and
reasoned
with
the
jews
when
they
desired
him
to
tarry
longer
time
with
them
he
consented
not
but
bade
them
farewell
saying
i
must
by
all
means
keep
this
feast
that
cometh
in
jerusalem
but
i
will
return
again
unto
you
if
god
will
and
he
sailed
from
ephesus
and
when
he
had
landed
at
caesarea
and
gone
up
and
saluted
the
church
he
went
down
to
antioch
and
after
he
had
spent
some
time
there
he
departed
and
went
over
all
the
country
of
galatia
and
phrygia
in
order
strengthening
all
the
disciples
and
a
certain
jew
named
apollos
born
at
alexandria
an
eloquent
man
and
mighty
in
the
scriptures
came
to
ephesus
this
man
was
instructed
in
the
way
of
the
lord
and
being
fervent
in
the
spirit
he
spake
and
taught
diligently
the
things
of
the
lord
knowing
only
the
baptism
of
john
and
he
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
synagogue
whom
when
aquila
and
priscilla
had
heard
they
took
him
unto
them
and
expounded
unto
him
the
way
of
god
more
perfectly
and
when
he
was
disposed
to
pass
into
achaia
the
brethren
wrote
exhorting
the
disciples
to
receive
him
who
when
he
was
come
helped
them
much
which
had
believed
through
grace
for
he
mightily
convinced
the
jews
and
that
publickly
shewing
by
the
scriptures
that
jesus
was
christ
and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
apollos
was
at
corinth
paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
ephesus
and
finding
certain
disciples
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
received
the
holy
ghost
since
ye
believed
and
they
said
unto
him
we
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
holy
ghost
and
he
said
unto
them
unto
what
then
were
ye
baptized
and
they
said
unto
john's
baptism
then
said
paul
john
verily
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
repentance
saying
unto
the
people
that
they
should
believe
on
him
which
should
come
after
him
that
is
on
christ
jesus
when
they
heard
this
they
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
when
paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
them
the
holy
ghost
came
on
them
and
they
spake
with
tongues
and
prophesied
and
all
the
men
were
about
twelve
and
he
went
into
the
synagogue
and
spake
boldly
for
the
space
of
three
months
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
but
when
divers
were
hardened
and
believed
not
but
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
multitude
he
departed
from
them
and
separated
the
disciples
disputing
daily
in
the
school
of
one
tyrannus
and
this
continued
by
the
space
of
two
years
so
that
all
they
which
dwelt
in
asia
heard
the
word
of
the
lord
jesus
both
jews
and
greeks
and
god
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
paul
so
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them
then
certain
of
the
vagabond
jews
exorcists
took
upon
them
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
saying
we
adjure
you
by
jesus
whom
paul
preacheth
and
there
were
seven
sons
of
one
sceva
a
jew
and
chief
of
the
priests
which
did
so
and
the
evil
spirit
answered
and
said
jesus
i
know
and
paul
i
know
but
who
are
ye
and
the
man
in
whom
the
evil
spirit
was
leaped
on
them
and
overcame
them
and
prevailed
against
them
so
that
they
fled
out
of
that
house
naked
and
wounded
and
this
was
known
to
all
the
jews
and
greeks
also
dwelling
at
ephesus
and
fear
fell
on
them
all
and
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
was
magnified
and
many
that
believed
came
and
confessed
and
shewed
their
deeds
many
of
them
also
which
used
curious
arts
brought
their
books
together
and
burned
them
before
all
men
and
they
counted
the
price
of
them
and
found
it
fifty
thousand
pieces
of
silver
so
mightily
grew
the
word
of
god
and
prevailed
after
these
things
were
ended
paul
purposed
in
the
spirit
when
he
had
passed
through
macedonia
and
achaia
to
go
to
jerusalem
saying
after
i
have
been
there
i
must
also
see
rome
so
he
sent
into
macedonia
two
of
them
that
ministered
unto
him
timotheus
and
erastus
but
he
himself
stayed
in
asia
for
a
season
and
the
same
time
there
arose
no
small
stir
about
that
way
for
a
certain
man
named
demetrius
a
silversmith
which
made
silver
shrines
for
diana
brought
no
small
gain
unto
the
craftsmen
whom
he
called
together
with
the
workmen
of
like
occupation
and
said
sirs
ye
know
that
by
this
craft
we
have
our
wealth
moreover
ye
see
and
hear
that
not
alone
at
ephesus
but
almost
throughout
all
asia
this
paul
hath
persuaded
and
turned
away
much
people
saying
that
they
be
no
gods
which
are
made
with
hands
so
that
not
only
this
our
craft
is
in
danger
to
be
set
at
nought
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
diana
should
be
despised
and
her
magnificence
should
be
destroyed
whom
all
asia
and
the
world
worshippeth
and
when
they
heard
these
sayings
they
were
full
of
wrath
and
cried
out
saying
great
is
diana
of
the
ephesians
and
the
whole
city
was
filled
with
confusion
and
having
caught
gaius
and
aristarchus
men
of
macedonia
paul's
companions
in
travel
they
rushed
with
one
accord
into
the
theatre
and
when
paul
would
have
entered
in
unto
the
people
the
disciples
suffered
him
not
and
certain
of
the
chief
of
asia
which
were
his
friends
sent
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
would
not
adventure
himself
into
the
theatre
some
therefore
cried
one
thing
and
some
another
for
the
assembly
was
confused
and
the
more
part
knew
not
wherefore
they
were
come
together
and
they
drew
alexander
out
of
the
multitude
the
jews
putting
him
forward
and
alexander
beckoned
with
the
hand
and
would
have
made
his
defence
unto
the
people
but
when
they
knew
that
he
was
a
jew
all
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
out
great
is
diana
of
the
ephesians
and
when
the
townclerk
had
appeased
the
people
he
said
ye
men
of
ephesus
what
man
is
there
that
knoweth
not
how
that
the
city
of
the
ephesians
is
a
worshipper
of
the
great
goddess
diana
and
of
the
image
which
fell
down
from
jupiter
seeing
then
that
these
things
cannot
be
spoken
against
ye
ought
to
be
quiet
and
to
do
nothing
rashly
for
ye
have
brought
hither
these
men
which
are
neither
robbers
of
churches
nor
yet
blasphemers
of
your
goddess
wherefore
if
demetrius
and
the
craftsmen
which
are
with
him
have
a
matter
against
any
man
the
law
is
open
and
there
are
deputies
let
them
implead
one
another
but
if
ye
enquire
any
thing
concerning
other
matters
it
shall
be
determined
in
a
lawful
assembly
for
we
are
in
danger
to
be
called
in
question
for
this
day's
uproar
there
being
no
cause
whereby
we
may
give
an
account
of
this
concourse
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
dismissed
the
assembly
and
after
the
uproar
was
ceased
paul
called
unto
him
the
disciples
and
embraced
them
and
departed
for
to
go
into
macedonia
and
when
he
had
gone
over
those
parts
and
had
given
them
much
exhortation
he
came
into
greece
and
there
abode
three
months
and
when
the
jews
laid
wait
for
him
as
he
was
about
to
sail
into
syria
he
purposed
to
return
through
macedonia
and
there
accompanied
him
into
asia
sopater
of
berea
and
of
the
thessalonians
aristarchus
and
secundus
and
gaius
of
derbe
and
timotheus
and
of
asia
tychicus
and
trophimus
these
going
before
tarried
for
us
at
troas
and
we
sailed
away
from
philippi
after
the
days
of
unleavened
bread
and
came
unto
them
to
troas
in
five
days
where
we
abode
seven
days
and
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
the
disciples
came
together
to
break
bread
paul
preached
unto
them
ready
to
depart
on
the
morrow
and
continued
his
speech
until
midnight
and
there
were
many
lights
in
the
upper
chamber
where
they
were
gathered
together
and
there
sat
in
a
window
a
certain
young
man
named
eutychus
being
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
and
as
paul
was
long
preaching
he
sunk
down
with
sleep
and
fell
down
from
the
third
loft
and
was
taken
up
dead
and
paul
went
down
and
fell
on
him
and
embracing
him
said
trouble
not
yourselves
for
his
life
is
in
him
when
he
therefore
was
come
up
again
and
had
broken
bread
and
eaten
and
talked
a
long
while
even
till
break
of
day
so
he
departed
and
they
brought
the
young
man
alive
and
were
not
a
little
comforted
and
we
went
before
to
ship
and
sailed
unto
assos
there
intending
to
take
in
paul
for
so
had
he
appointed
minding
himself
to
go
afoot
and
when
he
met
with
us
at
assos
we
took
him
in
and
came
to
mitylene
and
we
sailed
thence
and
came
the
next
day
over
against
chios
and
the
next
day
we
arrived
at
samos
and
tarried
at
trogyllium
and
the
next
day
we
came
to
miletus
for
paul
had
determined
to
sail
by
ephesus
because
he
would
not
spend
the
time
in
asia
for
he
hasted
if
it
were
possible
for
him
to
be
at
jerusalem
the
day
of
pentecost
and
from
miletus
he
sent
to
ephesus
and
called
the
elders
of
the
church
and
when
they
were
come
to
him
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
from
the
first
day
that
i
came
into
asia
after
what
manner
i
have
been
with
you
at
all
seasons
serving
the
lord
with
all
humility
of
mind
and
with
many
tears
and
temptations
which
befell
me
by
the
lying
in
wait
of
the
jews
and
how
i
kept
back
nothing
that
was
profitable
unto
you
but
have
shewed
you
and
have
taught
you
publickly
and
from
house
to
house
testifying
both
to
the
jews
and
also
to
the
greeks
repentance
toward
god
and
faith
toward
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
now
behold
i
go
bound
in
the
spirit
unto
jerusalem
not
knowing
the
things
that
shall
befall
me
there
save
that
the
holy
ghost
witnesseth
in
every
city
saying
that
bonds
and
afflictions
abide
me
but
none
of
these
things
move
me
neither
count
i
my
life
dear
unto
myself
so
that
i
might
finish
my
course
with
joy
and
the
ministry
which
i
have
received
of
the
lord
jesus
to
testify
the
gospel
of
the
grace
of
god
and
now
behold
i
know
that
ye
all
among
whom
i
have
gone
preaching
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
see
my
face
no
more
wherefore
i
take
you
to
record
this
day
that
i
am
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men
for
i
have
not
shunned
to
declare
unto
you
all
the
counsel
of
god
take
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
over
the
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
feed
the
church
of
god
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
blood
for
i
know
this
that
after
my
departing
shall
grievous
wolves
enter
in
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
also
of
your
own
selves
shall
men
arise
speaking
perverse
things
to
draw
away
disciples
after
them
therefore
watch
and
remember
that
by
the
space
of
three
years
i
ceased
not
to
warn
every
one
night
and
day
with
tears
and
now
brethren
i
commend
you
to
god
and
to
the
word
of
his
grace
which
is
able
to
build
you
up
and
to
give
you
an
inheritance
among
all
them
which
are
sanctified
i
have
coveted
no
man's
silver
or
gold
or
apparel
yea
ye
yourselves
know
that
these
hands
have
ministered
unto
my
necessities
and
to
them
that
were
with
me
i
have
shewed
you
all
things
how
that
so
labouring
ye
ought
to
support
the
weak
and
to
remember
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
how
he
said
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
with
them
all
and
they
all
wept
sore
and
fell
on
paul's
neck
and
kissed
him
sorrowing
most
of
all
for
the
words
which
he
spake
that
they
should
see
his
face
no
more
and
they
accompanied
him
unto
the
ship
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
were
gotten
from
them
and
had
launched
we
came
with
a
straight
course
unto
coos
and
the
day
following
unto
rhodes
and
from
thence
unto
patara
and
finding
a
ship
sailing
over
unto
phenicia
we
went
aboard
and
set
forth
now
when
we
had
discovered
cyprus
we
left
it
on
the
left
hand
and
sailed
into
syria
and
landed
at
tyre
for
there
the
ship
was
to
unlade
her
burden
and
finding
disciples
we
tarried
there
seven
days
who
said
to
paul
through
the
spirit
that
he
should
not
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
when
we
had
accomplished
those
days
we
departed
and
went
our
way
and
they
all
brought
us
on
our
way
with
wives
and
children
till
we
were
out
of
the
city
and
we
kneeled
down
on
the
shore
and
prayed
and
when
we
had
taken
our
leave
one
of
another
we
took
ship
and
they
returned
home
again
and
when
we
had
finished
our
course
from
tyre
we
came
to
ptolemais
and
saluted
the
brethren
and
abode
with
them
one
day
and
the
next
day
we
that
were
of
paul's
company
departed
and
came
unto
caesarea
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
philip
the
evangelist
which
was
one
of
the
seven
and
abode
with
him
and
the
same
man
had
four
daughters
virgins
which
did
prophesy
and
as
we
tarried
there
many
days
there
came
down
from
judaea
a
certain
prophet
named
agabus
and
when
he
was
come
unto
us
he
took
paul's
girdle
and
bound
his
own
hands
and
feet
and
said
thus
saith
the
holy
ghost
so
shall
the
jews
at
jerusalem
bind
the
man
that
owneth
this
girdle
and
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
gentiles
and
when
we
heard
these
things
both
we
and
they
of
that
place
besought
him
not
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
then
paul
answered
what
mean
ye
to
weep
and
to
break
mine
heart
for
i
am
ready
not
to
be
bound
only
but
also
to
die
at
jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
when
he
would
not
be
persuaded
we
ceased
saying
the
will
of
the
lord
be
done
and
after
those
days
we
took
up
our
carriages
and
went
up
to
jerusalem
there
went
with
us
also
certain
of
the
disciples
of
caesarea
and
brought
with
them
one
mnason
of
cyprus
an
old
disciple
with
whom
we
should
lodge
and
when
we
were
come
to
jerusalem
the
brethren
received
us
gladly
and
the
day
following
paul
went
in
with
us
unto
james
and
all
the
elders
were
present
and
when
he
had
saluted
them
he
declared
particularly
what
things
god
had
wrought
among
the
gentiles
by
his
ministry
and
when
they
heard
it
they
glorified
the
lord
and
said
unto
him
thou
seest
brother
how
many
thousands
of
jews
there
are
which
believe
and
they
are
all
zealous
of
the
law
and
they
are
informed
of
thee
that
thou
teachest
all
the
jews
which
are
among
the
gentiles
to
forsake
moses
saying
that
they
ought
not
to
circumcise
their
children
neither
to
walk
after
the
customs
what
is
it
therefore
the
multitude
must
needs
come
together
for
they
will
hear
that
thou
art
come
do
therefore
this
that
we
say
to
thee
we
have
four
men
which
have
a
vow
on
them
them
take
and
purify
thyself
with
them
and
be
at
charges
with
them
that
they
may
shave
their
heads
and
all
may
know
that
those
things
whereof
they
were
informed
concerning
thee
are
nothing
but
that
thou
thyself
also
walkest
orderly
and
keepest
the
law
as
touching
the
gentiles
which
believe
we
have
written
and
concluded
that
they
observe
no
such
thing
save
only
that
they
keep
themselves
from
things
offered
to
idols
and
from
blood
and
from
strangled
and
from
fornication
then
paul
took
the
men
and
the
next
day
purifying
himself
with
them
entered
into
the
temple
to
signify
the
accomplishment
of
the
days
of
purification
until
that
an
offering
should
be
offered
for
every
one
of
them
and
when
the
seven
days
were
almost
ended
the
jews
which
were
of
asia
when
they
saw
him
in
the
temple
stirred
up
all
the
people
and
laid
hands
on
him
crying
out
men
of
israel
help
this
is
the
man
that
teacheth
all
men
every
where
against
the
people
and
the
law
and
this
place
and
further
brought
greeks
also
into
the
temple
and
hath
polluted
this
holy
place
for
they
had
seen
before
with
him
in
the
city
trophimus
an
ephesian
whom
they
supposed
that
paul
had
brought
into
the
temple
and
all
the
city
was
moved
and
the
people
ran
together
and
they
took
paul
and
drew
him
out
of
the
temple
and
forthwith
the
doors
were
shut
and
as
they
went
about
to
kill
him
tidings
came
unto
the
chief
captain
of
the
band
that
all
jerusalem
was
in
an
uproar
who
immediately
took
soldiers
and
centurions
and
ran
down
unto
them
and
when
they
saw
the
chief
captain
and
the
soldiers
they
left
beating
of
paul
then
the
chief
captain
came
near
and
took
him
and
commanded
him
to
be
bound
with
two
chains
and
demanded
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
and
some
cried
one
thing
some
another
among
the
multitude
and
when
he
could
not
know
the
certainty
for
the
tumult
he
commanded
him
to
be
carried
into
the
castle
and
when
he
came
upon
the
stairs
so
it
was
that
he
was
borne
of
the
soldiers
for
the
violence
of
the
people
for
the
multitude
of
the
people
followed
after
crying
away
with
him
and
as
paul
was
to
be
led
into
the
castle
he
said
unto
the
chief
captain
may
i
speak
unto
thee
who
said
canst
thou
speak
greek
art
not
thou
that
egyptian
which
before
these
days
madest
an
uproar
and
leddest
out
into
the
wilderness
four
thousand
men
that
were
murderers
but
paul
said
i
am
a
man
which
am
a
jew
of
tarsus
a
city
in
cilicia
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city
and
i
beseech
thee
suffer
me
to
speak
unto
the
people
and
when
he
had
given
him
licence
paul
stood
on
the
stairs
and
beckoned
with
the
hand
unto
the
people
and
when
there
was
made
a
great
silence
he
spake
unto
them
in
the
hebrew
tongue
saying
men
brethren
and
fathers
hear
ye
my
defence
which
i
make
now
unto
you
and
when
they
heard
that
he
spake
in
the
hebrew
tongue
to
them
they
kept
the
more
silence
and
he
saith
i
am
verily
a
man
which
am
a
jew
born
in
tarsus
a
city
in
cilicia
yet
brought
up
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
gamaliel
and
taught
according
to
the
perfect
manner
of
the
law
of
the
fathers
and
was
zealous
toward
god
as
ye
all
are
this
day
and
i
persecuted
this
way
unto
the
death
binding
and
delivering
into
prisons
both
men
and
women
as
also
the
high
priest
doth
bear
me
witness
and
all
the
estate
of
the
elders
from
whom
also
i
received
letters
unto
the
brethren
and
went
to
damascus
to
bring
them
which
were
there
bound
unto
jerusalem
for
to
be
punished
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
i
made
my
journey
and
was
come
nigh
unto
damascus
about
noon
suddenly
there
shone
from
heaven
a
great
light
round
about
me
and
i
fell
unto
the
ground
and
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
and
i
answered
who
art
thou
lord
and
he
said
unto
me
i
am
jesus
of
nazareth
whom
thou
persecutest
and
they
that
were
with
me
saw
indeed
the
light
and
were
afraid
but
they
heard
not
the
voice
of
him
that
spake
to
me
and
i
said
what
shall
i
do
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
arise
and
go
into
damascus
and
there
it
shall
be
told
thee
of
all
things
which
are
appointed
for
thee
to
do
and
when
i
could
not
see
for
the
glory
of
that
light
being
led
by
the
hand
of
them
that
were
with
me
i
came
into
damascus
and
one
ananias
a
devout
man
according
to
the
law
having
a
good
report
of
all
the
jews
which
dwelt
there
came
unto
me
and
stood
and
said
unto
me
brother
saul
receive
thy
sight
and
the
same
hour
i
looked
up
upon
him
and
he
said
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
thee
that
thou
shouldest
know
his
will
and
see
that
just
one
and
shouldest
hear
the
voice
of
his
mouth
for
thou
shalt
be
his
witness
unto
all
men
of
what
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
and
now
why
tarriest
thou
arise
and
be
baptized
and
wash
away
thy
sins
calling
on
the
name
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
was
come
again
to
jerusalem
even
while
i
prayed
in
the
temple
i
was
in
a
trance
and
saw
him
saying
unto
me
make
haste
and
get
thee
quickly
out
of
jerusalem
for
they
will
not
receive
thy
testimony
concerning
me
and
i
said
lord
they
know
that
i
imprisoned
and
beat
in
every
synagogue
them
that
believed
on
thee
and
when
the
blood
of
thy
martyr
stephen
was
shed
i
also
was
standing
by
and
consenting
unto
his
death
and
kept
the
raiment
of
them
that
slew
him
and
he
said
unto
me
depart
for
i
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
gentiles
and
they
gave
him
audience
unto
this
word
and
then
lifted
up
their
voices
and
said
away
with
such
a
fellow
from
the
earth
for
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
live
and
as
they
cried
out
and
cast
off
their
clothes
and
threw
dust
into
the
air
the
chief
captain
commanded
him
to
be
brought
into
the
castle
and
bade
that
he
should
be
examined
by
scourging
that
he
might
know
wherefore
they
cried
so
against
him
and
as
they
bound
him
with
thongs
paul
said
unto
the
centurion
that
stood
by
is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
roman
and
uncondemned
when
the
centurion
heard
that
he
went
and
told
the
chief
captain
saying
take
heed
what
thou
doest
for
this
man
is
a
roman
then
the
chief
captain
came
and
said
unto
him
tell
me
art
thou
a
roman
he
said
yea
and
the
chief
captain
answered
with
a
great
sum
obtained
i
this
freedom
and
paul
said
but
i
was
free
born
then
straightway
they
departed
from
him
which
should
have
examined
him
and
the
chief
captain
also
was
afraid
after
he
knew
that
he
was
a
roman
and
because
he
had
bound
him
on
the
morrow
because
he
would
have
known
the
certainty
wherefore
he
was
accused
of
the
jews
he
loosed
him
from
his
bands
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
their
council
to
appear
and
brought
paul
down
and
set
him
before
them
and
paul
earnestly
beholding
the
council
said
men
and
brethren
i
have
lived
in
all
good
conscience
before
god
until
this
day
and
the
high
priest
ananias
commanded
them
that
stood
by
him
to
smite
him
on
the
mouth
then
said
paul
unto
him
god
shall
smite
thee
thou
whited
wall
for
sittest
thou
to
judge
me
after
the
law
and
commandest
me
to
be
smitten
contrary
to
the
law
and
they
that
stood
by
said
revilest
thou
god's
high
priest
then
said
paul
i
wist
not
brethren
that
he
was
the
high
priest
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
speak
evil
of
the
ruler
of
thy
people
but
when
paul
perceived
that
the
one
part
were
sadducees
and
the
other
pharisees
he
cried
out
in
the
council
men
and
brethren
i
am
a
pharisee
the
son
of
a
pharisee
of
the
hope
and
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
question
and
when
he
had
so
said
there
arose
a
dissension
between
the
pharisees
and
the
sadducees
and
the
multitude
was
divided
for
the
sadducees
say
that
there
is
no
resurrection
neither
angel
nor
spirit
but
the
pharisees
confess
both
and
there
arose
a
great
cry
and
the
scribes
that
were
of
the
pharisees
part
arose
and
strove
saying
we
find
no
evil
in
this
man
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
hath
spoken
to
him
let
us
not
fight
against
god
and
when
there
arose
a
great
dissension
the
chief
captain
fearing
lest
paul
should
have
been
pulled
in
pieces
of
them
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
down
and
to
take
him
by
force
from
among
them
and
to
bring
him
into
the
castle
and
the
night
following
the
lord
stood
by
him
and
said
be
of
good
cheer
paul
for
as
thou
hast
testified
of
me
in
jerusalem
so
must
thou
bear
witness
also
at
rome
and
when
it
was
day
certain
of
the
jews
banded
together
and
bound
themselves
under
a
curse
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
had
killed
paul
and
they
were
more
than
forty
which
had
made
this
conspiracy
and
they
came
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders
and
said
we
have
bound
ourselves
under
a
great
curse
that
we
will
eat
nothing
until
we
have
slain
paul
now
therefore
ye
with
the
council
signify
to
the
chief
captain
that
he
bring
him
down
unto
you
to
morrow
as
though
ye
would
enquire
something
more
perfectly
concerning
him
and
we
or
ever
he
come
near
are
ready
to
kill
him
and
when
paul's
sister's
son
heard
of
their
lying
in
wait
he
went
and
entered
into
the
castle
and
told
paul
then
paul
called
one
of
the
centurions
unto
him
and
said
bring
this
young
man
unto
the
chief
captain
for
he
hath
a
certain
thing
to
tell
him
so
he
took
him
and
brought
him
to
the
chief
captain
and
said
paul
the
prisoner
called
me
unto
him
and
prayed
me
to
bring
this
young
man
unto
thee
who
hath
something
to
say
unto
thee
then
the
chief
captain
took
him
by
the
hand
and
went
with
him
aside
privately
and
asked
him
what
is
that
thou
hast
to
tell
me
and
he
said
the
jews
have
agreed
to
desire
thee
that
thou
wouldest
bring
down
paul
to
morrow
into
the
council
as
though
they
would
enquire
somewhat
of
him
more
perfectly
but
do
not
thou
yield
unto
them
for
there
lie
in
wait
for
him
of
them
more
than
forty
men
which
have
bound
themselves
with
an
oath
that
they
will
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
they
have
killed
him
and
now
are
they
ready
looking
for
a
promise
from
thee
so
the
chief
captain
then
let
the
young
man
depart
and
charged
him
see
thou
tell
no
man
that
thou
hast
shewed
these
things
to
me
and
he
called
unto
him
two
centurions
saying
make
ready
two
hundred
soldiers
to
go
to
caesarea
and
horsemen
threescore
and
ten
and
spearmen
two
hundred
at
the
third
hour
of
the
night
and
provide
them
beasts
that
they
may
set
paul
on
and
bring
him
safe
unto
felix
the
governor
and
he
wrote
a
letter
after
this
manner
claudius
lysias
unto
the
most
excellent
governor
felix
sendeth
greeting
this
man
was
taken
of
the
jews
and
should
have
been
killed
of
them
then
came
i
with
an
army
and
rescued
him
having
understood
that
he
was
a
roman
and
when
i
would
have
known
the
cause
wherefore
they
accused
him
i
brought
him
forth
into
their
council
whom
i
perceived
to
be
accused
of
questions
of
their
law
but
to
have
nothing
laid
to
his
charge
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
and
when
it
was
told
me
how
that
the
jews
laid
wait
for
the
man
i
sent
straightway
to
thee
and
gave
commandment
to
his
accusers
also
to
say
before
thee
what
they
had
against
him
farewell
then
the
soldiers
as
it
was
commanded
them
took
paul
and
brought
him
by
night
to
antipatris
on
the
morrow
they
left
the
horsemen
to
go
with
him
and
returned
to
the
castle
who
when
they
came
to
caesarea
and
delivered
the
epistle
to
the
governor
presented
paul
also
before
him
and
when
the
governor
had
read
the
letter
he
asked
of
what
province
he
was
and
when
he
understood
that
he
was
of
cilicia
i
will
hear
thee
said
he
when
thine
accusers
are
also
come
and
he
commanded
him
to
be
kept
in
herod's
judgment
hall
and
after
five
days
ananias
the
high
priest
descended
with
the
elders
and
with
a
certain
orator
named
tertullus
who
informed
the
governor
against
paul
and
when
he
was
called
forth
tertullus
began
to
accuse
him
saying
seeing
that
by
thee
we
enjoy
great
quietness
and
that
very
worthy
deeds
are
done
unto
this
nation
by
thy
providence
we
accept
it
always
and
in
all
places
most
noble
felix
with
all
thankfulness
notwithstanding
that
i
be
not
further
tedious
unto
thee
i
pray
thee
that
thou
wouldest
hear
us
of
thy
clemency
a
few
words
for
we
have
found
this
man
a
pestilent
fellow
and
a
mover
of
sedition
among
all
the
jews
throughout
the
world
and
a
ringleader
of
the
sect
of
the
nazarenes
who
also
hath
gone
about
to
profane
the
temple
whom
we
took
and
would
have
judged
according
to
our
law
but
the
chief
captain
lysias
came
upon
us
and
with
great
violence
took
him
away
out
of
our
hands
commanding
his
accusers
to
come
unto
thee
by
examining
of
whom
thyself
mayest
take
knowledge
of
all
these
things
whereof
we
accuse
him
and
the
jews
also
assented
saying
that
these
things
were
so
then
paul
after
that
the
governor
had
beckoned
unto
him
to
speak
answered
forasmuch
as
i
know
that
thou
hast
been
of
many
years
a
judge
unto
this
nation
i
do
the
more
cheerfully
answer
for
myself
because
that
thou
mayest
understand
that
there
are
yet
but
twelve
days
since
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
for
to
worship
and
they
neither
found
me
in
the
temple
disputing
with
any
man
neither
raising
up
the
people
neither
in
the
synagogues
nor
in
the
city
neither
can
they
prove
the
things
whereof
they
now
accuse
me
but
this
i
confess
unto
thee
that
after
the
way
which
they
call
heresy
so
worship
i
the
god
of
my
fathers
believing
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets
and
have
hope
toward
god
which
they
themselves
also
allow
that
there
shall
be
a
resurrection
of
the
dead
both
of
the
just
and
unjust
and
herein
do
i
exercise
myself
to
have
always
a
conscience
void
to
offence
toward
god
and
toward
men
now
after
many
years
i
came
to
bring
alms
to
my
nation
and
offerings
whereupon
certain
jews
from
asia
found
me
purified
in
the
temple
neither
with
multitude
nor
with
tumult
who
ought
to
have
been
here
before
thee
and
object
if
they
had
ought
against
me
or
else
let
these
same
here
say
if
they
have
found
any
evil
doing
in
me
while
i
stood
before
the
council
except
it
be
for
this
one
voice
that
i
cried
standing
among
them
touching
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
am
called
in
question
by
you
this
day
and
when
felix
heard
these
things
having
more
perfect
knowledge
of
that
way
he
deferred
them
and
said
when
lysias
the
chief
captain
shall
come
down
i
will
know
the
uttermost
of
your
matter
and
he
commanded
a
centurion
to
keep
paul
and
to
let
him
have
liberty
and
that
he
should
forbid
none
of
his
acquaintance
to
minister
or
come
unto
him
and
after
certain
days
when
felix
came
with
his
wife
drusilla
which
was
a
jewess
he
sent
for
paul
and
heard
him
concerning
the
faith
in
christ
and
as
he
reasoned
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
to
come
felix
trembled
and
answered
go
thy
way
for
this
time
when
i
have
a
convenient
season
i
will
call
for
thee
he
hoped
also
that
money
should
have
been
given
him
of
paul
that
he
might
loose
him
wherefore
he
sent
for
him
the
oftener
and
communed
with
him
but
after
two
years
porcius
festus
came
into
felix
room
and
felix
willing
to
shew
the
jews
a
pleasure
left
paul
bound
now
when
festus
was
come
into
the
province
after
three
days
he
ascended
from
caesarea
to
jerusalem
then
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
of
the
jews
informed
him
against
paul
and
besought
him
and
desired
favour
against
him
that
he
would
send
for
him
to
jerusalem
laying
wait
in
the
way
to
kill
him
but
festus
answered
that
paul
should
be
kept
at
caesarea
and
that
he
himself
would
depart
shortly
thither
let
them
therefore
said
he
which
among
you
are
able
go
down
with
me
and
accuse
this
man
if
there
be
any
wickedness
in
him
and
when
he
had
tarried
among
them
more
than
ten
days
he
went
down
unto
caesarea
and
the
next
day
sitting
on
the
judgment
seat
commanded
paul
to
be
brought
and
when
he
was
come
the
jews
which
came
down
from
jerusalem
stood
round
about
and
laid
many
and
grievous
complaints
against
paul
which
they
could
not
prove
while
he
answered
for
himself
neither
against
the
law
of
the
jews
neither
against
the
temple
nor
yet
against
caesar
have
i
offended
any
thing
at
all
but
festus
willing
to
do
the
jews
a
pleasure
answered
paul
and
said
wilt
thou
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
there
be
judged
of
these
things
before
me
then
said
paul
i
stand
at
caesar's
judgment
seat
where
i
ought
to
be
judged
to
the
jews
have
i
done
no
wrong
as
thou
very
well
knowest
for
if
i
be
an
offender
or
have
committed
any
thing
worthy
of
death
i
refuse
not
to
die
but
if
there
be
none
of
these
things
whereof
these
accuse
me
no
man
may
deliver
me
unto
them
i
appeal
unto
caesar
then
festus
when
he
had
conferred
with
the
council
answered
hast
thou
appealed
unto
caesar
unto
caesar
shalt
thou
go
and
after
certain
days
king
agrippa
and
bernice
came
unto
caesarea
to
salute
festus
and
when
they
had
been
there
many
days
festus
declared
paul's
cause
unto
the
king
saying
there
is
a
certain
man
left
in
bonds
by
felix
about
whom
when
i
was
at
jerusalem
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
jews
informed
me
desiring
to
have
judgment
against
him
to
whom
i
answered
it
is
not
the
manner
of
the
romans
to
deliver
any
man
to
die
before
that
he
which
is
accused
have
the
accusers
face
to
face
and
have
licence
to
answer
for
himself
concerning
the
crime
laid
against
him
therefore
when
they
were
come
hither
without
any
delay
on
the
morrow
i
sat
on
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
forth
against
whom
when
the
accusers
stood
up
they
brought
none
accusation
of
such
things
as
i
supposed
but
had
certain
questions
against
him
of
their
own
superstition
and
of
one
jesus
which
was
dead
whom
paul
affirmed
to
be
alive
and
because
i
doubted
of
such
manner
of
questions
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
go
to
jerusalem
and
there
be
judged
of
these
matters
but
when
paul
had
appealed
to
be
reserved
unto
the
hearing
of
augustus
i
commanded
him
to
be
kept
till
i
might
send
him
to
caesar
then
agrippa
said
unto
festus
i
would
also
hear
the
man
myself
to
morrow
said
he
thou
shalt
hear
him
and
on
the
morrow
when
agrippa
was
come
and
bernice
with
great
pomp
and
was
entered
into
the
place
of
hearing
with
the
chief
captains
and
principal
men
of
the
city
at
festus
commandment
paul
was
brought
forth
and
festus
said
king
agrippa
and
all
men
which
are
here
present
with
us
ye
see
this
man
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of
the
jews
have
dealt
with
me
both
at
jerusalem
and
also
here
crying
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
longer
but
when
i
found
that
he
had
committed
nothing
worthy
of
death
and
that
he
himself
hath
appealed
to
augustus
i
have
determined
to
send
him
of
whom
i
have
no
certain
thing
to
write
unto
my
lord
wherefore
i
have
brought
him
forth
before
you
and
specially
before
thee
o
king
agrippa
that
after
examination
had
i
might
have
somewhat
to
write
for
it
seemeth
to
me
unreasonable
to
send
a
prisoner
and
not
withal
to
signify
the
crimes
laid
against
him
then
agrippa
said
unto
paul
thou
art
permitted
to
speak
for
thyself
then
paul
stretched
forth
the
hand
and
answered
for
himself
i
think
myself
happy
king
agrippa
because
i
shall
answer
for
myself
this
day
before
thee
touching
all
the
things
whereof
i
am
accused
of
the
jews
especially
because
i
know
thee
to
be
expert
in
all
customs
and
questions
which
are
among
the
jews
wherefore
i
beseech
thee
to
hear
me
patiently
my
manner
of
life
from
my
youth
which
was
at
the
first
among
mine
own
nation
at
jerusalem
know
all
the
jews
which
knew
me
from
the
beginning
if
they
would
testify
that
after
the
most
straitest
sect
of
our
religion
i
lived
a
pharisee
and
now
i
stand
and
am
judged
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
made
of
god
unto
our
fathers
unto
which
promise
our
twelve
tribes
instantly
serving
god
day
and
night
hope
to
come
for
which
hope's
sake
king
agrippa
i
am
accused
of
the
jews
why
should
it
be
thought
a
thing
incredible
with
you
that
god
should
raise
the
dead
i
verily
thought
with
myself
that
i
ought
to
do
many
things
contrary
to
the
name
of
jesus
of
nazareth
which
thing
i
also
did
in
jerusalem
and
many
of
the
saints
did
i
shut
up
in
prison
having
received
authority
from
the
chief
priests
and
when
they
were
put
to
death
i
gave
my
voice
against
them
and
i
punished
them
oft
in
every
synagogue
and
compelled
them
to
blaspheme
and
being
exceedingly
mad
against
them
i
persecuted
them
even
unto
strange
cities
whereupon
as
i
went
to
damascus
with
authority
and
commission
from
the
chief
priests
at
midday
o
king
i
saw
in
the
way
a
light
from
heaven
above
the
brightness
of
the
sun
shining
round
about
me
and
them
which
journeyed
with
me
and
when
we
were
all
fallen
to
the
earth
i
heard
a
voice
speaking
unto
me
and
saying
in
the
hebrew
tongue
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
and
i
said
who
art
thou
lord
and
he
said
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
but
rise
and
stand
upon
thy
feet
for
i
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
purpose
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
i
will
appear
unto
thee
delivering
thee
from
the
people
and
from
the
gentiles
unto
whom
now
i
send
thee
to
open
their
eyes
and
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
light
and
from
the
power
of
satan
unto
god
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
me
whereupon
o
king
agrippa
i
was
not
disobedient
unto
the
heavenly
vision
but
shewed
first
unto
them
of
damascus
and
at
jerusalem
and
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
judaea
and
then
to
the
gentiles
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
god
and
do
works
meet
for
repentance
for
these
causes
the
jews
caught
me
in
the
temple
and
went
about
to
kill
me
having
therefore
obtained
help
of
god
i
continue
unto
this
day
witnessing
both
to
small
and
great
saying
none
other
things
than
those
which
the
prophets
and
moses
did
say
should
come
that
christ
should
suffer
and
that
he
should
be
the
first
that
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
should
shew
light
unto
the
people
and
to
the
gentiles
and
as
he
thus
spake
for
himself
festus
said
with
a
loud
voice
paul
thou
art
beside
thyself
much
learning
doth
make
thee
mad
but
he
said
i
am
not
mad
most
noble
festus
but
speak
forth
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness
for
the
king
knoweth
of
these
things
before
whom
also
i
speak
freely
for
i
am
persuaded
that
none
of
these
things
are
hidden
from
him
for
this
thing
was
not
done
in
a
corner
king
agrippa
believest
thou
the
prophets
i
know
that
thou
believest
then
agrippa
said
unto
paul
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
and
paul
said
i
would
to
god
that
not
only
thou
but
also
all
that
hear
me
this
day
were
both
almost
and
altogether
such
as
i
am
except
these
bonds
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
the
king
rose
up
and
the
governor
and
bernice
and
they
that
sat
with
them
and
when
they
were
gone
aside
they
talked
between
themselves
saying
this
man
doeth
nothing
worthy
of
death
or
of
bonds
then
said
agrippa
unto
festus
this
man
might
have
been
set
at
liberty
if
he
had
not
appealed
unto
caesar
and
when
it
was
determined
that
we
should
sail
into
italy
they
delivered
paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
unto
one
named
julius
a
centurion
of
augustus
band
and
entering
into
a
ship
of
adramyttium
we
launched
meaning
to
sail
by
the
coasts
of
asia
one
aristarchus
a
macedonian
of
thessalonica
being
with
us
and
the
next
day
we
touched
at
sidon
and
julius
courteously
entreated
paul
and
gave
him
liberty
to
go
unto
his
friends
to
refresh
himself
and
when
we
had
launched
from
thence
we
sailed
under
cyprus
because
the
winds
were
contrary
and
when
we
had
sailed
over
the
sea
of
cilicia
and
pamphylia
we
came
to
myra
a
city
of
lycia
and
there
the
centurion
found
a
ship
of
alexandria
sailing
into
italy
and
he
put
us
therein
and
when
we
had
sailed
slowly
many
days
and
scarce
were
come
over
against
cnidus
the
wind
not
suffering
us
we
sailed
under
crete
over
against
salmone
and
hardly
passing
it
came
unto
a
place
which
is
called
the
fair
havens
nigh
whereunto
was
the
city
of
lasea
now
when
much
time
was
spent
and
when
sailing
was
now
dangerous
because
the
fast
was
now
already
past
paul
admonished
them
and
said
unto
them
sirs
i
perceive
that
this
voyage
will
be
with
hurt
and
much
damage
not
only
of
the
lading
and
ship
but
also
of
our
lives
nevertheless
the
centurion
believed
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
ship
more
than
those
things
which
were
spoken
by
paul
and
because
the
haven
was
not
commodious
to
winter
in
the
more
part
advised
to
depart
thence
also
if
by
any
means
they
might
attain
to
phenice
and
there
to
winter
which
is
an
haven
of
crete
and
lieth
toward
the
south
west
and
north
west
and
when
the
south
wind
blew
softly
supposing
that
they
had
obtained
their
purpose
loosing
thence
they
sailed
close
by
crete
but
not
long
after
there
arose
against
it
a
tempestuous
wind
called
euroclydon
and
when
the
ship
was
caught
and
could
not
bear
up
into
the
wind
we
let
her
drive
and
running
under
a
certain
island
which
is
called
clauda
we
had
much
work
to
come
by
the
boat
which
when
they
had
taken
up
they
used
helps
undergirding
the
ship
and
fearing
lest
they
should
fall
into
the
quicksands
strake
sail
and
so
were
driven
and
we
being
exceedingly
tossed
with
a
tempest
the
next
day
they
lightened
the
ship
and
the
third
day
we
cast
out
with
our
own
hands
the
tackling
of
the
ship
and
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
in
many
days
appeared
and
no
small
tempest
lay
on
us
all
hope
that
we
should
be
saved
was
then
taken
away
but
after
long
abstinence
paul
stood
forth
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
sirs
ye
should
have
hearkened
unto
me
and
not
have
loosed
from
crete
and
to
have
gained
this
harm
and
loss
and
now
i
exhort
you
to
be
of
good
cheer
for
there
shall
be
no
loss
of
any
man's
life
among
you
but
of
the
ship
for
there
stood
by
me
this
night
the
angel
of
god
whose
i
am
and
whom
i
serve
saying
fear
not
paul
thou
must
be
brought
before
caesar
and
lo
god
hath
given
thee
all
them
that
sail
with
thee
wherefore
sirs
be
of
good
cheer
for
i
believe
god
that
it
shall
be
even
as
it
was
told
me
howbeit
we
must
be
cast
upon
a
certain
island
but
when
the
fourteenth
night
was
come
as
we
were
driven
up
and
down
in
adria
about
midnight
the
shipmen
deemed
that
they
drew
near
to
some
country
and
sounded
and
found
it
twenty
fathoms
and
when
they
had
gone
a
little
further
they
sounded
again
and
found
it
fifteen
fathoms
then
fearing
lest
we
should
have
fallen
upon
rocks
they
cast
four
anchors
out
of
the
stern
and
wished
for
the
day
and
as
the
shipmen
were
about
to
flee
out
of
the
ship
when
they
had
let
down
the
boat
into
the
sea
under
colour
as
though
they
would
have
cast
anchors
out
of
the
foreship
paul
said
to
the
centurion
and
to
the
soldiers
except
these
abide
in
the
ship
ye
cannot
be
saved
then
the
soldiers
cut
off
the
ropes
of
the
boat
and
let
her
fall
off
and
while
the
day
was
coming
on
paul
besought
them
all
to
take
meat
saying
this
day
is
the
fourteenth
day
that
ye
have
tarried
and
continued
fasting
having
taken
nothing
wherefore
i
pray
you
to
take
some
meat
for
this
is
for
your
health
for
there
shall
not
an
hair
fall
from
the
head
of
any
of
you
and
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
took
bread
and
gave
thanks
to
god
in
presence
of
them
all
and
when
he
had
broken
it
he
began
to
eat
then
were
they
all
of
good
cheer
and
they
also
took
some
meat
and
we
were
in
all
in
the
ship
two
hundred
threescore
and
sixteen
souls
and
when
they
had
eaten
enough
they
lightened
the
ship
and
cast
out
the
wheat
into
the
sea
and
when
it
was
day
they
knew
not
the
land
but
they
discovered
a
certain
creek
with
a
shore
into
the
which
they
were
minded
if
it
were
possible
to
thrust
in
the
ship
and
when
they
had
taken
up
the
anchors
they
committed
themselves
unto
the
sea
and
loosed
the
rudder
bands
and
hoised
up
the
mainsail
to
the
wind
and
made
toward
shore
and
falling
into
a
place
where
two
seas
met
they
ran
the
ship
aground
and
the
forepart
stuck
fast
and
remained
unmoveable
but
the
hinder
part
was
broken
with
the
violence
of
the
waves
and
the
soldiers
counsel
was
to
kill
the
prisoners
lest
any
of
them
should
swim
out
and
escape
but
the
centurion
willing
to
save
paul
kept
them
from
their
purpose
and
commanded
that
they
which
could
swim
should
cast
themselves
first
into
the
sea
and
get
to
land
and
the
rest
some
on
boards
and
some
on
broken
pieces
of
the
ship
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
they
escaped
all
safe
to
land
and
when
they
were
escaped
then
they
knew
that
the
island
was
called
melita
and
the
barbarous
people
shewed
us
no
little
kindness
for
they
kindled
a
fire
and
received
us
every
one
because
of
the
present
rain
and
because
of
the
cold
and
when
paul
had
gathered
a
bundle
of
sticks
and
laid
them
on
the
fire
there
came
a
viper
out
of
the
heat
and
fastened
on
his
hand
and
when
the
barbarians
saw
the
venomous
beast
hang
on
his
hand
they
said
among
themselves
no
doubt
this
man
is
a
murderer
whom
though
he
hath
escaped
the
sea
yet
vengeance
suffereth
not
to
live
and
he
shook
off
the
beast
into
the
fire
and
felt
no
harm
howbeit
they
looked
when
he
should
have
swollen
or
fallen
down
dead
suddenly
but
after
they
had
looked
a
great
while
and
saw
no
harm
come
to
him
they
changed
their
minds
and
said
that
he
was
a
god
in
the
same
quarters
were
possessions
of
the
chief
man
of
the
island
whose
name
was
publius
who
received
us
and
lodged
us
three
days
courteously
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
father
of
publius
lay
sick
of
a
fever
and
of
a
bloody
flux
to
whom
paul
entered
in
and
prayed
and
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
healed
him
so
when
this
was
done
others
also
which
had
diseases
in
the
island
came
and
were
healed
who
also
honoured
us
with
many
honours
and
when
we
departed
they
laded
us
with
such
things
as
were
necessary
and
after
three
months
we
departed
in
a
ship
of
alexandria
which
had
wintered
in
the
isle
whose
sign
was
castor
and
pollux
and
landing
at
syracuse
we
tarried
there
three
days
and
from
thence
we
fetched
a
compass
and
came
to
rhegium
and
after
one
day
the
south
wind
blew
and
we
came
the
next
day
to
puteoli
where
we
found
brethren
and
were
desired
to
tarry
with
them
seven
days
and
so
we
went
toward
rome
and
from
thence
when
the
brethren
heard
of
us
they
came
to
meet
us
as
far
as
appii
forum
and
the
three
taverns
whom
when
paul
saw
he
thanked
god
and
took
courage
and
when
we
came
to
rome
the
centurion
delivered
the
prisoners
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
but
paul
was
suffered
to
dwell
by
himself
with
a
soldier
that
kept
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
days
paul
called
the
chief
of
the
jews
together
and
when
they
were
come
together
he
said
unto
them
men
and
brethren
though
i
have
committed
nothing
against
the
people
or
customs
of
our
fathers
yet
was
i
delivered
prisoner
from
jerusalem
into
the
hands
of
the
romans
who
when
they
had
examined
me
would
have
let
me
go
because
there
was
no
cause
of
death
in
me
but
when
the
jews
spake
against
it
i
was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
caesar
not
that
i
had
ought
to
accuse
my
nation
of
for
this
cause
therefore
have
i
called
for
you
to
see
you
and
to
speak
with
you
because
that
for
the
hope
of
israel
i
am
bound
with
this
chain
and
they
said
unto
him
we
neither
received
letters
out
of
judaea
concerning
thee
neither
any
of
the
brethren
that
came
shewed
or
spake
any
harm
of
thee
but
we
desire
to
hear
of
thee
what
thou
thinkest
for
as
concerning
this
sect
we
know
that
every
where
it
is
spoken
against
and
when
they
had
appointed
him
a
day
there
came
many
to
him
into
his
lodging
to
whom
he
expounded
and
testified
the
kingdom
of
god
persuading
them
concerning
jesus
both
out
of
the
law
of
moses
and
out
of
the
prophets
from
morning
till
evening
and
some
believed
the
things
which
were
spoken
and
some
believed
not
and
when
they
agreed
not
among
themselves
they
departed
after
that
paul
had
spoken
one
word
well
spake
the
holy
ghost
by
esaias
the
prophet
unto
our
fathers
saying
go
unto
this
people
and
say
hearing
ye
shall
hear
and
shall
not
understand
and
seeing
ye
shall
see
and
not
perceive
for
the
heart
of
this
people
is
waxed
gross
and
their
ears
are
dull
of
hearing
and
their
eyes
have
they
closed
lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
be
it
known
therefore
unto
you
that
the
salvation
of
god
is
sent
unto
the
gentiles
and
that
they
will
hear
it
and
when
he
had
said
these
words
the
jews
departed
and
had
great
reasoning
among
themselves
and
paul
dwelt
two
whole
years
in
his
own
hired
house
and
received
all
that
came
in
unto
him
preaching
the
kingdom
of
god
and
teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
lord
jesus
christ
with
all
confidence
no
man
forbidding
him
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
romans
paul
a
servant
of
jesus
christ
called
to
be
an
apostle
separated
unto
the
gospel
of
god
which
he
had
promised
afore
by
his
prophets
in
the
holy
scriptures
concerning
his
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
which
was
made
of
the
seed
of
david
according
to
the
flesh
and
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
with
power
according
to
the
spirit
of
holiness
by
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
by
whom
we
have
received
grace
and
apostleship
for
obedience
to
the
faith
among
all
nations
for
his
name
among
whom
are
ye
also
the
called
of
jesus
christ
to
all
that
be
in
rome
beloved
of
god
called
to
be
saints
grace
to
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
first
i
thank
my
god
through
jesus
christ
for
you
all
that
your
faith
is
spoken
of
throughout
the
whole
world
for
god
is
my
witness
whom
i
serve
with
my
spirit
in
the
gospel
of
his
son
that
without
ceasing
i
make
mention
of
you
always
in
my
prayers
making
request
if
by
any
means
now
at
length
i
might
have
a
prosperous
journey
by
the
will
of
god
to
come
unto
you
for
i
long
to
see
you
that
i
may
impart
unto
you
some
spiritual
gift
to
the
end
ye
may
be
established
that
is
that
i
may
be
comforted
together
with
you
by
the
mutual
faith
both
of
you
and
me
now
i
would
not
have
you
ignorant
brethren
that
oftentimes
i
purposed
to
come
unto
you
but
was
let
hitherto
that
i
might
have
some
fruit
among
you
also
even
as
among
other
gentiles
i
am
debtor
both
to
the
greeks
and
to
the
barbarians
both
to
the
wise
and
to
the
unwise
so
as
much
as
in
me
is
i
am
ready
to
preach
the
gospel
to
you
that
are
at
rome
also
for
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
gospel
of
christ
for
it
is
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth
to
the
jew
first
and
also
to
the
greek
for
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
god
revealed
from
faith
to
faith
as
it
is
written
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
for
the
wrath
of
god
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
who
hold
the
truth
in
unrighteousness
because
that
which
may
be
known
of
god
is
manifest
in
them
for
god
hath
shewed
it
unto
them
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
so
that
they
are
without
excuse
because
that
when
they
knew
god
they
glorified
him
not
as
god
neither
were
thankful
but
became
vain
in
their
imaginations
and
their
foolish
heart
was
darkened
professing
themselves
to
be
wise
they
became
fools
and
changed
the
glory
of
the
uncorruptible
god
into
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
man
and
to
birds
and
fourfooted
beasts
and
creeping
things
wherefore
god
also
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
through
the
lusts
of
their
own
hearts
to
dishonour
their
own
bodies
between
themselves
who
changed
the
truth
of
god
into
a
lie
and
worshipped
and
served
the
creature
more
than
the
creator
who
is
blessed
for
ever
amen
for
this
cause
god
gave
them
up
unto
vile
affections
for
even
their
women
did
change
the
natural
use
into
that
which
is
against
nature
and
likewise
also
the
men
leaving
the
natural
use
of
the
woman
burned
in
their
lust
one
toward
another
men
with
men
working
that
which
is
unseemly
and
receiving
in
themselves
that
recompence
of
their
error
which
was
meet
and
even
as
they
did
not
like
to
retain
god
in
their
knowledge
god
gave
them
over
to
a
reprobate
mind
to
do
those
things
which
are
not
convenient
being
filled
with
all
unrighteousness
fornication
wickedness
covetousness
maliciousness
full
of
envy
murder
debate
deceit
malignity
whisperers
backbiters
haters
of
god
despiteful
proud
boasters
inventors
of
evil
things
disobedient
to
parents
without
understanding
covenantbreakers
without
natural
affection
implacable
unmerciful
who
knowing
the
judgment
of
god
that
they
which
commit
such
things
are
worthy
of
death
not
only
do
the
same
but
have
pleasure
in
them
that
do
them
therefore
thou
art
inexcusable
o
man
whosoever
thou
art
that
judgest
for
wherein
thou
judgest
another
thou
condemnest
thyself
for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the
same
things
but
we
are
sure
that
the
judgment
of
god
is
according
to
truth
against
them
which
commit
such
things
and
thinkest
thou
this
o
man
that
judgest
them
which
do
such
things
and
doest
the
same
that
thou
shalt
escape
the
judgment
of
god
or
despisest
thou
the
riches
of
his
goodness
and
forbearance
and
longsuffering
not
knowing
that
the
goodness
of
god
leadeth
thee
to
repentance
but
after
thy
hardness
and
impenitent
heart
treasurest
up
unto
thyself
wrath
against
the
day
of
wrath
and
revelation
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
who
will
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
deeds
to
them
who
by
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
seek
for
glory
and
honour
and
immortality
eternal
life
but
unto
them
that
are
contentious
and
do
not
obey
the
truth
but
obey
unrighteousness
indignation
and
wrath
tribulation
and
anguish
upon
every
soul
of
man
that
doeth
evil
of
the
jew
first
and
also
of
the
gentile
but
glory
honour
and
peace
to
every
man
that
worketh
good
to
the
jew
first
and
also
to
the
gentile
for
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
with
god
for
as
many
as
have
sinned
without
law
shall
also
perish
without
law
and
as
many
as
have
sinned
in
the
law
shall
be
judged
by
the
law
for
not
the
hearers
of
the
law
are
just
before
god
but
the
doers
of
the
law
shall
be
justified
for
when
the
gentiles
which
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law
these
having
not
the
law
are
a
law
unto
themselves
which
shew
the
work
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts
their
conscience
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
another
in
the
day
when
god
shall
judge
the
secrets
of
men
by
jesus
christ
according
to
my
gospel
behold
thou
art
called
a
jew
and
restest
in
the
law
and
makest
thy
boast
of
god
and
knowest
his
will
and
approvest
the
things
that
are
more
excellent
being
instructed
out
of
the
law
and
art
confident
that
thou
thyself
art
a
guide
of
the
blind
a
light
of
them
which
are
in
darkness
an
instructor
of
the
foolish
a
teacher
of
babes
which
hast
the
form
of
knowledge
and
of
the
truth
in
the
law
thou
therefore
which
teachest
another
teachest
thou
not
thyself
thou
that
preachest
a
man
should
not
steal
dost
thou
steal
thou
that
sayest
a
man
should
not
commit
adultery
dost
thou
commit
adultery
thou
that
abhorrest
idols
dost
thou
commit
sacrilege
thou
that
makest
thy
boast
of
the
law
through
breaking
the
law
dishonourest
thou
god
for
the
name
of
god
is
blasphemed
among
the
gentiles
through
you
as
it
is
written
for
circumcision
verily
profiteth
if
thou
keep
the
law
but
if
thou
be
a
breaker
of
the
law
thy
circumcision
is
made
uncircumcision
therefore
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
law
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision
and
shall
not
uncircumcision
which
is
by
nature
if
it
fulfil
the
law
judge
thee
who
by
the
letter
and
circumcision
dost
transgress
the
law
for
he
is
not
a
jew
which
is
one
outwardly
neither
is
that
circumcision
which
is
outward
in
the
flesh
but
he
is
a
jew
which
is
one
inwardly
and
circumcision
is
that
of
the
heart
in
the
spirit
and
not
in
the
letter
whose
praise
is
not
of
men
but
of
god
what
advantage
then
hath
the
jew
or
what
profit
is
there
of
circumcision
much
every
way
chiefly
because
that
unto
them
were
committed
the
oracles
of
god
for
what
if
some
did
not
believe
shall
their
unbelief
make
the
faith
of
god
without
effect
god
forbid
yea
let
god
be
true
but
every
man
a
liar
as
it
is
written
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
in
thy
sayings
and
mightest
overcome
when
thou
art
judged
but
if
our
unrighteousness
commend
the
righteousness
of
god
what
shall
we
say
is
god
unrighteous
who
taketh
vengeance
i
speak
as
a
man
god
forbid
for
then
how
shall
god
judge
the
world
for
if
the
truth
of
god
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
glory
why
yet
am
i
also
judged
as
a
sinner
and
not
rather
as
we
be
slanderously
reported
and
as
some
affirm
that
we
say
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
whose
damnation
is
just
what
then
are
we
better
than
they
no
in
no
wise
for
we
have
before
proved
both
jews
and
gentiles
that
they
are
all
under
sin
as
it
is
written
there
is
none
righteous
no
not
one
there
is
none
that
understandeth
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
god
they
are
all
gone
out
of
the
way
they
are
together
become
unprofitable
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
deceit
the
poison
of
asps
is
under
their
lips
whose
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
bitterness
their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
destruction
and
misery
are
in
their
ways
and
the
way
of
peace
have
they
not
known
there
is
no
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
now
we
know
that
what
things
soever
the
law
saith
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under
the
law
that
every
mouth
may
be
stopped
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
god
therefore
by
the
deeds
of
the
law
there
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
in
his
sight
for
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
sin
but
now
the
righteousness
of
god
without
the
law
is
manifested
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
prophets
even
the
righteousness
of
god
which
is
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
unto
all
and
upon
all
them
that
believe
for
there
is
no
difference
for
all
have
sinned
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
god
being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
past
through
the
forbearance
of
god
to
declare
i
say
at
this
time
his
righteousness
that
he
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
jesus
where
is
boasting
then
it
is
excluded
by
what
law
of
works
nay
but
by
the
law
of
faith
therefore
we
conclude
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
without
the
deeds
of
the
law
is
he
the
god
of
the
jews
only
is
he
not
also
of
the
gentiles
yes
of
the
gentiles
also
seeing
it
is
one
god
which
shall
justify
the
circumcision
by
faith
and
uncircumcision
through
faith
do
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
faith
god
forbid
yea
we
establish
the
law
what
shall
we
say
then
that
abraham
our
father
as
pertaining
to
the
flesh
hath
found
for
if
abraham
were
justified
by
works
he
hath
whereof
to
glory
but
not
before
god
for
what
saith
the
scripture
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
now
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
grace
but
of
debt
but
to
him
that
worketh
not
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly
his
faith
is
counted
for
righteousness
even
as
david
also
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
man
unto
whom
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
works
saying
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
are
covered
blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
lord
will
not
impute
sin
cometh
this
blessedness
then
upon
the
circumcision
only
or
upon
the
uncircumcision
also
for
we
say
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
abraham
for
righteousness
how
was
it
then
reckoned
when
he
was
in
circumcision
or
in
uncircumcision
not
in
circumcision
but
in
uncircumcision
and
he
received
the
sign
of
circumcision
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
of
the
faith
which
he
had
yet
being
uncircumcised
that
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
them
that
believe
though
they
be
not
circumcised
that
righteousness
might
be
imputed
unto
them
also
and
the
father
of
circumcision
to
them
who
are
not
of
the
circumcision
only
but
who
also
walk
in
the
steps
of
that
faith
of
our
father
abraham
which
he
had
being
yet
uncircumcised
for
the
promise
that
he
should
be
the
heir
of
the
world
was
not
to
abraham
or
to
his
seed
through
the
law
but
through
the
righteousness
of
faith
for
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
be
heirs
faith
is
made
void
and
the
promise
made
of
none
effect
because
the
law
worketh
wrath
for
where
no
law
is
there
is
no
transgression
therefore
it
is
of
faith
that
it
might
be
by
grace
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
seed
not
to
that
only
which
is
of
the
law
but
to
that
also
which
is
of
the
faith
of
abraham
who
is
the
father
of
us
all
as
it
is
written
i
have
made
thee
a
father
of
many
nations
before
him
whom
he
believed
even
god
who
quickeneth
the
dead
and
calleth
those
things
which
be
not
as
though
they
were
who
against
hope
believed
in
hope
that
he
might
become
the
father
of
many
nations
according
to
that
which
was
spoken
so
shall
thy
seed
be
and
being
not
weak
in
faith
he
considered
not
his
own
body
now
dead
when
he
was
about
an
hundred
years
old
neither
yet
the
deadness
of
sarah's
womb
he
staggered
not
at
the
promise
of
god
through
unbelief
but
was
strong
in
faith
giving
glory
to
god
and
being
fully
persuaded
that
what
he
had
promised
he
was
able
also
to
perform
and
therefore
it
was
imputed
to
him
for
righteousness
now
it
was
not
written
for
his
sake
alone
that
it
was
imputed
to
him
but
for
us
also
to
whom
it
shall
be
imputed
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
jesus
our
lord
from
the
dead
who
was
delivered
for
our
offences
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification
therefore
being
justified
by
faith
we
have
peace
with
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
stand
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
god
and
not
only
so
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
also
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
patience
and
patience
experience
and
experience
hope
and
hope
maketh
not
ashamed
because
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
which
is
given
unto
us
for
when
we
were
yet
without
strength
in
due
time
christ
died
for
the
ungodly
for
scarcely
for
a
righteous
man
will
one
die
yet
peradventure
for
a
good
man
some
would
even
dare
to
die
but
god
commendeth
his
love
toward
us
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
us
much
more
then
being
now
justified
by
his
blood
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
him
for
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
death
of
his
son
much
more
being
reconciled
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
life
and
not
only
so
but
we
also
joy
in
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
atonement
wherefore
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
by
sin
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men
for
that
all
have
sinned
for
until
the
law
sin
was
in
the
world
but
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
law
nevertheless
death
reigned
from
adam
to
moses
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
adam's
transgression
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
come
but
not
as
the
offence
so
also
is
the
free
gift
for
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
dead
much
more
the
grace
of
god
and
the
gift
by
grace
which
is
by
one
man
jesus
christ
hath
abounded
unto
many
and
not
as
it
was
by
one
that
sinned
so
is
the
gift
for
the
judgment
was
by
one
to
condemnation
but
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
justification
for
if
by
one
man's
offence
death
reigned
by
one
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
one
jesus
christ
therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
condemnation
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
life
for
as
by
one
man's
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
righteous
moreover
the
law
entered
that
the
offence
might
abound
but
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
much
more
abound
that
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
death
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
jesus
christ
our
lord
what
shall
we
say
then
shall
we
continue
in
sin
that
grace
may
abound
god
forbid
how
shall
we
that
are
dead
to
sin
live
any
longer
therein
know
ye
not
that
so
many
of
us
as
were
baptized
into
jesus
christ
were
baptized
into
his
death
therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
death
that
like
as
christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
father
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
life
for
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection
knowing
this
that
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
him
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
destroyed
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
sin
for
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
sin
now
if
we
be
dead
with
christ
we
believe
that
we
shall
also
live
with
him
knowing
that
christ
being
raised
from
the
dead
dieth
no
more
death
hath
no
more
dominion
over
him
for
in
that
he
died
he
died
unto
sin
once
but
in
that
he
liveth
he
liveth
unto
god
likewise
reckon
ye
also
yourselves
to
be
dead
indeed
unto
sin
but
alive
unto
god
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
let
not
sin
therefore
reign
in
your
mortal
body
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
thereof
neither
yield
ye
your
members
as
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
sin
but
yield
yourselves
unto
god
as
those
that
are
alive
from
the
dead
and
your
members
as
instruments
of
righteousness
unto
god
for
sin
shall
not
have
dominion
over
you
for
ye
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
grace
what
then
shall
we
sin
because
we
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
grace
god
forbid
know
ye
not
that
to
whom
ye
yield
yourselves
servants
to
obey
his
servants
ye
are
to
whom
ye
obey
whether
of
sin
unto
death
or
of
obedience
unto
righteousness
but
god
be
thanked
that
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin
but
ye
have
obeyed
from
the
heart
that
form
of
doctrine
which
was
delivered
you
being
then
made
free
from
sin
ye
became
the
servants
of
righteousness
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
because
of
the
infirmity
of
your
flesh
for
as
ye
have
yielded
your
members
servants
to
uncleanness
and
to
iniquity
unto
iniquity
even
so
now
yield
your
members
servants
to
righteousness
unto
holiness
for
when
ye
were
the
servants
of
sin
ye
were
free
from
righteousness
what
fruit
had
ye
then
in
those
things
whereof
ye
are
now
ashamed
for
the
end
of
those
things
is
death
but
now
being
made
free
from
sin
and
become
servants
to
god
ye
have
your
fruit
unto
holiness
and
the
end
everlasting
life
for
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
but
the
gift
of
god
is
eternal
life
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
know
ye
not
brethren
for
i
speak
to
them
that
know
the
law
how
that
the
law
hath
dominion
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
liveth
for
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
is
bound
by
the
law
to
her
husband
so
long
as
he
liveth
but
if
the
husband
be
dead
she
is
loosed
from
the
law
of
her
husband
so
then
if
while
her
husband
liveth
she
be
married
to
another
man
she
shall
be
called
an
adulteress
but
if
her
husband
be
dead
she
is
free
from
that
law
so
that
she
is
no
adulteress
though
she
be
married
to
another
man
wherefore
my
brethren
ye
also
are
become
dead
to
the
law
by
the
body
of
christ
that
ye
should
be
married
to
another
even
to
him
who
is
raised
from
the
dead
that
we
should
bring
forth
fruit
unto
god
for
when
we
were
in
the
flesh
the
motions
of
sins
which
were
by
the
law
did
work
in
our
members
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
death
but
now
we
are
delivered
from
the
law
that
being
dead
wherein
we
were
held
that
we
should
serve
in
newness
of
spirit
and
not
in
the
oldness
of
the
letter
what
shall
we
say
then
is
the
law
sin
god
forbid
nay
i
had
not
known
sin
but
by
the
law
for
i
had
not
known
lust
except
the
law
had
said
thou
shalt
not
covet
but
sin
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment
wrought
in
me
all
manner
of
concupiscence
for
without
the
law
sin
was
dead
for
i
was
alive
without
the
law
once
but
when
the
commandment
came
sin
revived
and
i
died
and
the
commandment
which
was
ordained
to
life
i
found
to
be
unto
death
for
sin
taking
occasion
by
the
commandment
deceived
me
and
by
it
slew
me
wherefore
the
law
is
holy
and
the
commandment
holy
and
just
and
good
was
then
that
which
is
good
made
death
unto
me
god
forbid
but
sin
that
it
might
appear
sin
working
death
in
me
by
that
which
is
good
that
sin
by
the
commandment
might
become
exceeding
sinful
for
we
know
that
the
law
is
spiritual
but
i
am
carnal
sold
under
sin
for
that
which
i
do
i
allow
not
for
what
i
would
that
do
i
not
but
what
i
hate
that
do
i
if
then
i
do
that
which
i
would
not
i
consent
unto
the
law
that
it
is
good
now
then
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
it
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me
for
i
know
that
in
me
that
is
in
my
flesh
dwelleth
no
good
thing
for
to
will
is
present
with
me
but
how
to
perform
that
which
is
good
i
find
not
for
the
good
that
i
would
i
do
not
but
the
evil
which
i
would
not
that
i
do
now
if
i
do
that
i
would
not
it
is
no
more
i
that
do
it
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me
i
find
then
a
law
that
when
i
would
do
good
evil
is
present
with
me
for
i
delight
in
the
law
of
god
after
the
inward
man
but
i
see
another
law
in
my
members
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
to
the
law
of
sin
which
is
in
my
members
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
i
thank
god
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
so
then
with
the
mind
i
myself
serve
the
law
of
god
but
with
the
flesh
the
law
of
sin
there
is
therefore
now
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
christ
jesus
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
for
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
in
christ
jesus
hath
made
me
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
death
for
what
the
law
could
not
do
in
that
it
was
weak
through
the
flesh
god
sending
his
own
son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
in
the
flesh
that
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
us
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
for
they
that
are
after
the
flesh
do
mind
the
things
of
the
flesh
but
they
that
are
after
the
spirit
the
things
of
the
spirit
for
to
be
carnally
minded
is
death
but
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
and
peace
because
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
god
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
god
neither
indeed
can
be
so
then
they
that
are
in
the
flesh
cannot
please
god
but
ye
are
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
if
so
be
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwell
in
you
now
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
and
if
christ
be
in
you
the
body
is
dead
because
of
sin
but
the
spirit
is
life
because
of
righteousness
but
if
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
you
he
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
you
therefore
brethren
we
are
debtors
not
to
the
flesh
to
live
after
the
flesh
for
if
ye
live
after
the
flesh
ye
shall
die
but
if
ye
through
the
spirit
do
mortify
the
deeds
of
the
body
ye
shall
live
for
as
many
as
are
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
they
are
the
sons
of
god
for
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
fear
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
we
cry
abba
father
the
spirit
itself
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit
that
we
are
the
children
of
god
and
if
children
then
heirs
heirs
of
god
and
joint-heirs
with
christ
if
so
be
that
we
suffer
with
him
that
we
may
be
also
glorified
together
for
i
reckon
that
the
sufferings
of
this
present
time
are
not
worthy
to
be
compared
with
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
in
us
for
the
earnest
expectation
of
the
creature
waiteth
for
the
manifestation
of
the
sons
of
god
for
the
creature
was
made
subject
to
vanity
not
willingly
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
the
same
in
hope
because
the
creature
itself
also
shall
be
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
corruption
into
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
children
of
god
for
we
know
that
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
in
pain
together
until
now
and
not
only
they
but
ourselves
also
which
have
the
firstfruits
of
the
spirit
even
we
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves
waiting
for
the
adoption
to
wit
the
redemption
of
our
body
for
we
are
saved
by
hope
but
hope
that
is
seen
is
not
hope
for
what
a
man
seeth
why
doth
he
yet
hope
for
but
if
we
hope
for
that
we
see
not
then
do
we
with
patience
wait
for
it
likewise
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmities
for
we
know
not
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
itself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
cannot
be
uttered
and
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
spirit
because
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
to
them
who
are
the
called
according
to
his
purpose
for
whom
he
did
foreknow
he
also
did
predestinate
to
be
conformed
to
the
image
of
his
son
that
he
might
be
the
firstborn
among
many
brethren
moreover
whom
he
did
predestinate
them
he
also
called
and
whom
he
called
them
he
also
justified
and
whom
he
justified
them
he
also
glorified
what
shall
we
then
say
to
these
things
if
god
be
for
us
who
can
be
against
us
he
that
spared
not
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all
how
shall
he
not
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
things
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god's
elect
it
is
god
that
justifieth
who
is
he
that
condemneth
it
is
christ
that
died
yea
rather
that
is
risen
again
who
is
even
at
the
right
hand
of
god
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
us
who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
christ
shall
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
peril
or
sword
as
it
is
written
for
thy
sake
we
are
killed
all
the
day
long
we
are
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
nay
in
all
these
things
we
are
more
than
conquerors
through
him
that
loved
us
for
i
am
persuaded
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
powers
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creature
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
i
say
the
truth
in
christ
i
lie
not
my
conscience
also
bearing
me
witness
in
the
holy
ghost
that
i
have
great
heaviness
and
continual
sorrow
in
my
heart
for
i
could
wish
that
myself
were
accursed
from
christ
for
my
brethren
my
kinsmen
according
to
the
flesh
who
are
israelites
to
whom
pertaineth
the
adoption
and
the
glory
and
the
covenants
and
the
giving
of
the
law
and
the
service
of
god
and
the
promises
whose
are
the
fathers
and
of
whom
as
concerning
the
flesh
christ
came
who
is
over
all
god
blessed
for
ever
amen
not
as
though
the
word
of
god
hath
taken
none
effect
for
they
are
not
all
israel
which
are
of
israel
neither
because
they
are
the
seed
of
abraham
are
they
all
children
but
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
that
is
they
which
are
the
children
of
the
flesh
these
are
not
the
children
of
god
but
the
children
of
the
promise
are
counted
for
the
seed
for
this
is
the
word
of
promise
at
this
time
will
i
come
and
sarah
shall
have
a
son
and
not
only
this
but
when
rebecca
also
had
conceived
by
one
even
by
our
father
isaac
for
the
children
being
not
yet
born
neither
having
done
any
good
or
evil
that
the
purpose
of
god
according
to
election
might
stand
not
of
works
but
of
him
that
calleth
it
was
said
unto
her
the
elder
shall
serve
the
younger
as
it
is
written
jacob
have
i
loved
but
esau
have
i
hated
what
shall
we
say
then
is
there
unrighteousness
with
god
god
forbid
for
he
saith
to
moses
i
will
have
mercy
on
whom
i
will
have
mercy
and
i
will
have
compassion
on
whom
i
will
have
compassion
so
then
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
god
that
sheweth
mercy
for
the
scripture
saith
unto
pharaoh
even
for
this
same
purpose
have
i
raised
thee
up
that
i
might
shew
my
power
in
thee
and
that
my
name
might
be
declared
throughout
all
the
earth
therefore
hath
he
mercy
on
whom
he
will
have
mercy
and
whom
he
will
he
hardeneth
thou
wilt
say
then
unto
me
why
doth
he
yet
find
fault
for
who
hath
resisted
his
will
nay
but
o
man
who
art
thou
that
repliest
against
god
shall
the
thing
formed
say
to
him
that
formed
it
why
hast
thou
made
me
thus
hath
not
the
potter
power
over
the
clay
of
the
same
lump
to
make
one
vessel
unto
honour
and
another
unto
dishonour
what
if
god
willing
to
shew
his
wrath
and
to
make
his
power
known
endured
with
much
longsuffering
the
vessels
of
wrath
fitted
to
destruction
and
that
he
might
make
known
the
riches
of
his
glory
on
the
vessels
of
mercy
which
he
had
afore
prepared
unto
glory
even
us
whom
he
hath
called
not
of
the
jews
only
but
also
of
the
gentiles
as
he
saith
also
in
osee
i
will
call
them
my
people
which
were
not
my
people
and
her
beloved
which
was
not
beloved
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
unto
them
ye
are
not
my
people
there
shall
they
be
called
the
children
of
the
living
god
esaias
also
crieth
concerning
israel
though
the
number
of
the
children
of
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
a
remnant
shall
be
saved
for
he
will
finish
the
work
and
cut
it
short
in
righteousness
because
a
short
work
will
the
lord
make
upon
the
earth
and
as
esaias
said
before
except
the
lord
of
sabaoth
had
left
us
a
seed
we
had
been
as
sodoma
and
been
made
like
unto
gomorrha
what
shall
we
say
then
that
the
gentiles
which
followed
not
after
righteousness
have
attained
to
righteousness
even
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
but
israel
which
followed
after
the
law
of
righteousness
hath
not
attained
to
the
law
of
righteousness
wherefore
because
they
sought
it
not
by
faith
but
as
it
were
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
they
stumbled
at
that
stumblingstone
as
it
is
written
behold
i
lay
in
sion
a
stumblingstone
and
rock
of
offence
and
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
brethren
my
heart's
desire
and
prayer
to
god
for
israel
is
that
they
might
be
saved
for
i
bear
them
record
that
they
have
a
zeal
of
god
but
not
according
to
knowledge
for
they
being
ignorant
of
god's
righteousness
and
going
about
to
establish
their
own
righteousness
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
god
for
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
for
moses
describeth
the
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
that
the
man
which
doeth
those
things
shall
live
by
them
but
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
speaketh
on
this
wise
say
not
in
thine
heart
who
shall
ascend
into
heaven
that
is
to
bring
christ
down
from
above
or
who
shall
descend
into
the
deep
that
is
to
bring
up
christ
again
from
the
dead
but
what
saith
it
the
word
is
nigh
thee
even
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
is
the
word
of
faith
which
we
preach
that
if
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
the
lord
jesus
and
shalt
believe
in
thine
heart
that
god
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
thou
shalt
be
saved
for
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
righteousness
and
with
the
mouth
confession
is
made
unto
salvation
for
the
scripture
saith
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
for
there
is
no
difference
between
the
jew
and
the
greek
for
the
same
lord
over
all
is
rich
unto
all
that
call
upon
him
for
whosoever
shall
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
saved
how
then
shall
they
call
on
him
in
whom
they
have
not
believed
and
how
shall
they
believe
in
him
of
whom
they
have
not
heard
and
how
shall
they
hear
without
a
preacher
and
how
shall
they
preach
except
they
be
sent
as
it
is
written
how
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
them
that
preach
the
gospel
of
peace
and
bring
glad
tidings
of
good
things
but
they
have
not
all
obeyed
the
gospel
for
esaias
saith
lord
who
hath
believed
our
report
so
then
faith
cometh
by
hearing
and
hearing
by
the
word
of
god
but
i
say
have
they
not
heard
yes
verily
their
sound
went
into
all
the
earth
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
world
but
i
say
did
not
israel
know
first
moses
saith
i
will
provoke
you
to
jealousy
by
them
that
are
no
people
and
by
a
foolish
nation
i
will
anger
you
but
esaias
is
very
bold
and
saith
i
was
found
of
them
that
sought
me
not
i
was
made
manifest
unto
them
that
asked
not
after
me
but
to
israel
he
saith
all
day
long
i
have
stretched
forth
my
hands
unto
a
disobedient
and
gainsaying
people
i
say
then
hath
god
cast
away
his
people
god
forbid
for
i
also
am
an
israelite
of
the
seed
of
abraham
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
god
hath
not
cast
away
his
people
which
he
foreknew
wot
ye
not
what
the
scripture
saith
of
elias
how
he
maketh
intercession
to
god
against
israel
saying
lord
they
have
killed
thy
prophets
and
digged
down
thine
altars
and
i
am
left
alone
and
they
seek
my
life
but
what
saith
the
answer
of
god
unto
him
i
have
reserved
to
myself
seven
thousand
men
who
have
not
bowed
the
knee
to
the
image
of
baal
even
so
then
at
this
present
time
also
there
is
a
remnant
according
to
the
election
of
grace
and
if
by
grace
then
is
it
no
more
of
works
otherwise
grace
is
no
more
grace
but
if
it
be
of
works
then
it
is
no
more
grace
otherwise
work
is
no
more
work
what
then
israel
hath
not
obtained
that
which
he
seeketh
for
but
the
election
hath
obtained
it
and
the
rest
were
blinded
according
as
it
is
written
god
hath
given
them
the
spirit
of
slumber
eyes
that
they
should
not
see
and
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
unto
this
day
and
david
saith
let
their
table
be
made
a
snare
and
a
trap
and
a
stumblingblock
and
a
recompence
unto
them
let
their
eyes
be
darkened
that
they
may
not
see
and
bow
down
their
back
alway
i
say
then
have
they
stumbled
that
they
should
fall
god
forbid
but
rather
through
their
fall
salvation
is
come
unto
the
gentiles
for
to
provoke
them
to
jealousy
now
if
the
fall
of
them
be
the
riches
of
the
world
and
the
diminishing
of
them
the
riches
of
the
gentiles
how
much
more
their
fulness
for
i
speak
to
you
gentiles
inasmuch
as
i
am
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
i
magnify
mine
office
if
by
any
means
i
may
provoke
to
emulation
them
which
are
my
flesh
and
might
save
some
of
them
for
if
the
casting
away
of
them
be
the
reconciling
of
the
world
what
shall
the
receiving
of
them
be
but
life
from
the
dead
for
if
the
firstfruit
be
holy
the
lump
is
also
holy
and
if
the
root
be
holy
so
are
the
branches
and
if
some
of
the
branches
be
broken
off
and
thou
being
a
wild
olive
tree
wert
graffed
in
among
them
and
with
them
partakest
of
the
root
and
fatness
of
the
olive
tree
boast
not
against
the
branches
but
if
thou
boast
thou
bearest
not
the
root
but
the
root
thee
thou
wilt
say
then
the
branches
were
broken
off
that
i
might
be
graffed
in
well
because
of
unbelief
they
were
broken
off
and
thou
standest
by
faith
be
not
highminded
but
fear
for
if
god
spared
not
the
natural
branches
take
heed
lest
he
also
spare
not
thee
behold
therefore
the
goodness
and
severity
of
god
on
them
which
fell
severity
but
toward
thee
goodness
if
thou
continue
in
his
goodness
otherwise
thou
also
shalt
be
cut
off
and
they
also
if
they
abide
not
still
in
unbelief
shall
be
graffed
in
for
god
is
able
to
graff
them
in
again
for
if
thou
wert
cut
out
of
the
olive
tree
which
is
wild
by
nature
and
wert
graffed
contrary
to
nature
into
a
good
olive
tree
how
much
more
shall
these
which
be
the
natural
branches
be
graffed
into
their
own
olive
tree
for
i
would
not
brethren
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
this
mystery
lest
ye
should
be
wise
in
your
own
conceits
that
blindness
in
part
is
happened
to
israel
until
the
fulness
of
the
gentiles
be
come
in
and
so
all
israel
shall
be
saved
as
it
is
written
there
shall
come
out
of
sion
the
deliverer
and
shall
turn
away
ungodliness
from
jacob
for
this
is
my
covenant
unto
them
when
i
shall
take
away
their
sins
as
concerning
the
gospel
they
are
enemies
for
your
sakes
but
as
touching
the
election
they
are
beloved
for
the
father's
sakes
for
the
gifts
and
calling
of
god
are
without
repentance
for
as
ye
in
times
past
have
not
believed
god
yet
have
now
obtained
mercy
through
their
unbelief
even
so
have
these
also
now
not
believed
that
through
your
mercy
they
also
may
obtain
mercy
for
god
hath
concluded
them
all
in
unbelief
that
he
might
have
mercy
upon
all
o
the
depth
of
the
riches
both
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgments
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor
or
who
hath
first
given
to
him
and
it
shall
be
recompensed
unto
him
again
for
of
him
and
through
him
and
to
him
are
all
things
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
amen
i
beseech
you
therefore
brethren
by
the
mercies
of
god
that
ye
present
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
acceptable
unto
god
which
is
your
reasonable
service
and
be
not
conformed
to
this
world
but
be
ye
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
your
mind
that
ye
may
prove
what
is
that
good
and
acceptable
and
perfect
will
of
god
for
i
say
through
the
grace
given
unto
me
to
every
man
that
is
among
you
not
to
think
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
ought
to
think
but
to
think
soberly
according
as
god
hath
dealt
to
every
man
the
measure
of
faith
for
as
we
have
many
members
in
one
body
and
all
members
have
not
the
same
office
so
we
being
many
are
one
body
in
christ
and
every
one
members
one
of
another
having
then
gifts
differing
according
to
the
grace
that
is
given
to
us
whether
prophecy
let
us
prophesy
according
to
the
proportion
of
faith
or
ministry
let
us
wait
on
our
ministering
or

that
teacheth

that

him
do
it
with

he
that
ruleth
with
diligence
he
that
sheweth
mercy
with
cheerfulness
let
love
be
without
dissimulation

to
that
which

to
another
with

saith
the
lord
therefore
if
thine
enemy

him

him

so
doing
thou
shalt
heap
coals

overcome
evil
with
good
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
whosoever
therefore
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
and
they
that
resist
shall
receive
to
themselves
damnation
for
rulers
are
not
a
terror
to
good
works
but
to
the
evil
wilt
thou
then
not
be
afraid
of
the
power
do
that
which
is
good
and
thou
shalt
have
praise
of
the
same
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
to
thee
for
good
but
if
thou
do
that
which
is
evil
be
afraid
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
a
revenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
him
that
doeth
evil
wherefore
ye
must
needs
be
subject
not
only
for
wrath
but
also
for
conscience
sake
for
for
this
cause
pay
ye
tribute
also
for
they
are
god's
ministers
attending
continually
upon
this
very
thing
render
therefore
to
all
their
dues
tribute
to
whom
tribute
is
due
custom
to
whom
custom
fear
to
whom
fear
honour
to
whom
honour
owe
no
man
any
thing
but
to
love
one
another
for
he
that
loveth
another
hath
fulfilled
the
law
for
this
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
thou
shalt
not
covet
and
if
there
be
any
other
commandment
it
is
briefly
comprehended
in
this
saying
namely
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
love
worketh
no
ill
to
his
neighbour
therefore
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
and
that
knowing
the
time
that
now
it
is
high
time
to
awake
out
of
sleep
for
now
is
our
salvation
nearer
than
when
we
believed
the
night
is
far
spent
the
day
is
at
hand
let
us
therefore
cast
off
the
works
of
darkness
and
let
us
put
on
the
armour
of
light
let
us
walk
honestly
as
in
the
day
not
in
rioting
and
drunkenness
not
in
chambering
and
wantonness
not
in
strife
and
envying
but
put
ye
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh
to
fulfil
the
lusts
thereof
him
that
is
weak
in
the
faith
receive
ye
but
not
to
doubtful
disputations
for
one
believeth
that
he
may
eat
all
things
another
who
is
weak
eateth
herbs
let
not
him
that
eateth
despise
him
that
eateth
not
and
let
not
him
which
eateth
not
judge
him
that
eateth
for
god
hath
received
him
who
art
thou
that
judgest
another
man's
servant
to
his
own
master
he
standeth
or
falleth
yea
he
shall
be
holden
up
for
god
is
able
to
make
him
stand
one
man
esteemeth
one
day
above
another
another
esteemeth
every
day
alike
let
every
man
be
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
he
that
regardeth
the
day
regardeth
it
unto
the
lord
and
he
that
regardeth
not
the
day
to
the
lord
he
doth
not
regard
it
he
that
eateth
eateth
to
the
lord
for
he
giveth
god
thanks
and
he
that
eateth
not
to
the
lord
he
eateth
not
and
giveth
god
thanks
for
none
of
us
liveth
to
himself
and
no
man
dieth
to
himself
for
whether
we
live
we
live
unto
the
lord
and
whether
we
die
we
die
unto
the
lord
whether
we
live
therefore
or
die
we
are
the
lord's
for
to
this
end
christ
both
died
and
rose
and
revived
that
he
might
be
lord
both
of
the
dead
and
living
but
why
dost
thou
judge
thy
brother
or
why
dost
thou
set
at
nought
thy
brother
for
we
shall
all
stand
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
for
it
is
written
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
god
so
then
every
one
of
us
shall
give
account
of
himself
to
god
let
us
not
therefore
judge
one
another
any
more
but
judge
this
rather
that
no
man
put
a
stumblingblock
or
an
occasion
to
fall
in
his
brother's
way
i
know
and
am
persuaded
by
the
lord
jesus
that
there
is
nothing
unclean
of
itself
but
to
him
that
esteemeth
any
thing
to
be
unclean
to
him
it
is
unclean
but
if
thy
brother
be
grieved
with
thy
meat
now
walkest
thou
not
charitably
destroy
not
him
with
thy
meat
for
whom
christ
died
let
not
then
your
good
be
evil
spoken
of
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
meat
and
drink
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
for
he
that
in
these
things
serveth
christ
is
acceptable
to
god
and
approved
of
men
let
us
therefore
follow
after
the
things
which
make
for
peace
and
things
wherewith
one
may
edify
another
for
meat
destroy
not
the
work
of
god
all
things
indeed
are
pure
but
it
is
evil
for
that
man
who
eateth
with
offence
it
is
good
neither
to
eat
flesh
nor
to
drink
wine
nor
any
thing
whereby
thy
brother
stumbleth
or
is
offended
or
is
made
weak
hast
thou
faith
have
it
to
thyself
before
god
happy
is
he
that
condemneth
not
himself
in
that
thing
which
he
alloweth
and
he
that
doubteth
is
damned
if
he
eat
because
he
eateth
not
of
faith
for
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
we
then
that
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
the
weak
and
not
to
please
ourselves
let
every
one
of
us
please
his
neighbour
for
his
good
to
edification
for
even
christ
pleased
not
himself
but
as
it
is
written
the
reproaches
of
them
that
reproached
thee
fell
on
me
for
whatsoever
things
were
written
aforetime
were
written
for
our
learning
that
we
through
patience
and
comfort
of
the
scriptures
might
have
hope
now
the
god
of
patience
and
consolation
grant
you
to
be
likeminded
one
toward
another
according
to
christ
jesus
that
ye
may
with
one
mind
and
one
mouth
glorify
god
even
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
wherefore
receive
ye
one
another
as
christ
also
received
us
to
the
glory
of
god
now
i
say
that
jesus
christ
was
a
minister
of
the
circumcision
for
the
truth
of
god
to
confirm
the
promises
made
unto
the
fathers
and
that
the
gentiles
might
glorify
god
for
his
mercy
as
it
is
written
for
this
cause
i
will
confess
to
thee
among
the
gentiles
and
sing
unto
thy
name
and
again
he
saith
rejoice
ye
gentiles
with
his
people
and
again
praise
the
lord
all
ye
gentiles
and
laud
him
all
ye
people
and
again
esaias
saith
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
and
he
that
shall
rise
to
reign
over
the
gentiles
in
him
shall
the
gentiles
trust
now
the
god
of
hope
fill
you
with
all
joy
and
peace
in
believing
that
ye
may
abound
in
hope
through
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
i
myself
also
am
persuaded
of
you
my
brethren
that
ye
also
are
full
of
goodness
filled
with
all
knowledge
able
also
to
admonish
one
another
nevertheless
brethren
i
have
written
the
more
boldly
unto
you
in
some
sort
as
putting
you
in
mind
because
of
the
grace
that
is
given
to
me
of
god
that
i
should
be
the
minister
of
jesus
christ
to
the
gentiles
ministering
the
gospel
of
god
that
the
offering
up
of
the
gentiles
might
be
acceptable
being
sanctified
by
the
holy
ghost
i
have
therefore
whereof
i
may
glory
through
jesus
christ
in
those
things
which
pertain
to
god
for
i
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
any
of
those
things
which
christ
hath
not
wrought
by
me
to
make
the
gentiles
obedient
by
word
and
deed
through
mighty
signs
and
wonders
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
of
god
so
that
from
jerusalem
and
round
about
unto
illyricum
i
have
fully
preached
the
gospel
of
christ
yea
so
have
i
strived
to
preach
the
gospel
not
where
christ
was
named
lest
i
should
build
upon
another
man's
foundation
but
as
it
is
written
to
whom
he
was
not
spoken
of
they
shall
see
and
they
that
have
not
heard
shall
understand
for
which
cause
also
i
have
been
much
hindered
from
coming
to
you
but
now
having
no
more
place
in
these
parts
and
having
a
great
desire
these
many
years
to
come
unto
you
whensoever
i
take
my
journey
into
spain
i
will
come
to
you
for
i
trust
to
see
you
in
my
journey
and
to
be
brought
on
my
way
thitherward
by
you
if
first
i
be
somewhat
filled
with
your
company
but
now
i
go
unto
jerusalem
to
minister
unto
the
saints
for
it
hath
pleased
them
of
macedonia
and
achaia
to
make
a
certain
contribution
for
the
poor
saints
which
are
at
jerusalem
it
hath
pleased
them
verily
and
their
debtors
they
are
for
if
the
gentiles
have
been
made
partakers
of
their
spiritual
things
their
duty
is
also
to
minister
unto
them
in
carnal
things
when
therefore
i
have
performed
this
and
have
sealed
to
them
this
fruit
i
will
come
by
you
into
spain
and
i
am
sure
that
when
i
come
unto
you
i
shall
come
in
the
fulness
of
the
blessing
of
the
gospel
of
christ
now
i
beseech
you
brethren
for
the
lord
jesus
christ's
sake
and
for
the
love
of
the
spirit
that
ye
strive
together
with
me
in
your
prayers
to
god
for
me
that
i
may
be
delivered
from
them
that
do
not
believe
in
judaea
and
that
my
service
which
i
have
for
jerusalem
may
be
accepted
of
the
saints
that
i
may
come
unto
you
with
joy
by
the
will
of
god
and
may
with
you
be
refreshed

both
their's
and
our's
grace
be
unto

and
peace
from

and
from
the
lord
jesus

i
thank
my
god
always
on
your
behalf
for
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
you
by
jesus
christ
that
in
every
thing
ye
are
enriched
by
him
in
all
utterance
and
in
all
knowledge
even
as
the
testimony
of
christ
was
confirmed
in
you
so
that
ye
come
behind
in
no
gift
waiting
for
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
also
confirm
you
unto
the
end
that
ye
may
be
blameless
in
the
day
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
god
is
faithful
by
whom
ye
were
called
unto
the
fellowship
of
his
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
now
i
beseech
you
brethren
by
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
ye
all
speak
the
same
thing
and
that
there
be
no
divisions
among
you
but
that
ye
be
perfectly
joined
together
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
judgment
for
it
hath
been
declared
unto
me
of
you
my
brethren
by
them
which
are
of
the
house
of
chloe
that
there
are
contentions
among
you
now
this
i
say
that
every
one
of
you
saith
i
am
of
paul
and
i
of
apollos
and
i
of
cephas
and
i
of
christ
is
christ
divided
was
paul
crucified
for
you
or
were
ye
baptized
in
the
name
of
paul
i
thank
god
that
i
baptized
none
of
you
but
crispus
and
gaius
lest
any
should
say
that
i
had
baptized
in
mine
own
name
and
i
baptized
also
the
household
of
stephanas
besides
i
know
not
whether
i
baptized
any
other
for
christ
sent
me
not
to
baptize
but
to
preach
the
gospel
not
with
wisdom
of
words
lest
the
cross
of
christ
should
be
made
of
none
effect
for
the
preaching
of
the
cross
is
to
them
that
perish
foolishness
but
unto
us
which
are
saved
it
is
the
power
of
god
for
it
is
written
i
will
destroy
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
and
will
bring
to
nothing
the
understanding
of
the
prudent
where
is
the
wise
where
is
the
scribe
where
is
the
disputer
of
this
world
hath
not
god
made
foolish
the
wisdom
of
this
world
for
after
that
in
the
wisdom
of
god
the
world
by
wisdom
knew
not
god
it
pleased
god
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
believe
for
the
jews
require
a
sign
and
the
greeks
seek
after
wisdom
but
we
preach
christ
crucified
unto
the
jews
a
stumblingblock
and
unto
the
greeks
foolishness
but
unto
them
which
are
called
both
jews
and
greeks
christ
the
power
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
because
the
foolishness
of
god
is
wiser
than
men
and
the
weakness
of
god
is
stronger
than
men
for
ye
see
your
calling
brethren
how
that
not
many
wise
men
after
the
flesh
not
many
mighty
not
many
noble
are
called
but
god
hath
chosen
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
wise
and
god
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
and
base
things
of
the
world
and
things
which
are
despised
hath
god
chosen
yea
and
things
which
are
not
to
bring
to
nought
things
that
are
that
no
flesh
should
glory
in
his
presence
but
of
him
are
ye
in
christ
jesus
who
of
god
is
made
unto
us
wisdom
and
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
redemption
that
according
as
it
is
written
he
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
in
the
lord
and
i
brethren
when
i
came
to
you
came
not
with
excellency
of
speech
or
of
wisdom
declaring
unto
you
the
testimony
of
god
for
i
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
you
save
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
and
i
was
with
you
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
in
much
trembling
and
my
speech
and
my
preaching
was
not
with
enticing
words
of
man's
wisdom
but
in
demonstration
of
the
spirit
and
of
power
that
your
faith
should
not
stand
in
the
wisdom
of
men
but
in
the
power
of
god
howbeit
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
perfect
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
world
nor
of
the
princes
of
this
world
that
come
to
nought
but
we
speak
the
wisdom
of
god
in
a
mystery
even
the
hidden
wisdom
which
god
ordained
before
the
world
unto
our
glory
which
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
knew
for
had
they
known
it
they
would
not
have
crucified
the
lord
of
glory
but
as
it
is
written
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
have
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
but
god
hath
revealed
them
unto
us
by
his
spirit
for
the
spirit
searcheth
all
things
yea
the
deep
things
of
god
for
what
man
knoweth
the
things
of
a
man
save
the
spirit
of
man
which
is
in
him
even
so
the
things
of
god
knoweth
no
man
but
the
spirit
of
god
now
we
have
received
not
the
spirit
of
the
world
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
god
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
god
which
things
also
we
speak
not
in
the
words
which
man's
wisdom
teacheth
but
which
the
holy
ghost
teacheth
comparing
spiritual
things
with
spiritual
but
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
neither
can
he
know
them
because
they
are
spiritually
discerned
but
he
that
is
spiritual
judgeth
all
things
yet
he
himself
is
judged
of
no
man
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
that
he
may
instruct
him
but
we
have
the
mind
of
christ
and
i
brethren
could
not
speak
unto
you
as
unto
spiritual
but
as
unto
carnal
even
as
unto
babes
in
christ
i
have
fed
you
with
milk
and
not
with
meat
for
hitherto
ye
were
not
able
to
bear
it
neither
yet
now
are
ye
able
for
ye
are
yet
carnal
for
whereas
there
is
among
you
envying
and
strife
and
divisions
are
ye
not
carnal
and
walk
as
men
for
while
one
saith
i
am
of
paul
and
another
i
am
of
apollos
are
ye
not
carnal
who
then
is
paul
and
who
is
apollos
but
ministers
by
whom
ye
believed
even
as
the
lord
gave
to
every
man
i
have
planted
apollos
watered
but
god
gave
the
increase
so
then
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
thing
neither
he
that
watereth
but
god
that
giveth
the
increase
now
he
that
planteth
and
he
that
watereth
are
one
and
every
man
shall
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
labour
for
we
are
labourers
together
with
god
ye
are
god's
husbandry
ye
are
god's
building
according
to
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
unto
me
as
a
wise
masterbuilder
i
have
laid
the
foundation
and
another
buildeth
thereon
but
let
every
man
take
heed
how
he
buildeth
thereupon
for
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
is
laid
which
is
jesus
christ
now
if
any
man
build
upon
this
foundation
gold
silver
precious
stones
wood
hay
stubble
every
man's
work
shall
be
made
manifest
for
the
day
shall
declare
it
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
fire
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man's
work
of
what
sort
it
is
if
any
man's
work
abide
which
he
hath
built
thereupon
he
shall
receive
a
reward
if
any
man's
work
shall
be
burned
he
shall
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
fire
know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
you
if
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
god
him
shall
god
destroy
for
the
temple
of
god
is
holy
which
temple
ye
are
let
no
man
deceive
himself
if
any
man
among
you
seemeth
to
be
wise
in
this
world
let
him
become
a
fool
that
he
may
be
wise
for
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
god
for
it
is
written
he
taketh
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
and
again
the
lord
knoweth
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
that
they
are
vain
therefore
let
no
man
glory
in
men
for
all
things
are
your's
whether
paul
or
apollos
or
cephas
or
the
world
or
life
or
death
or
things
present
or
things
to
come
all
are
your's
and
ye
are
christ's
and
christ
is
god's
let
a
man
so
account
of
us
as
of
the
ministers
of
christ
and
stewards
of
the
mysteries
of
god
moreover
it
is
required
in
stewards
that
a
man
be
found
faithful
but
with
me
it
is
a
very
small
thing
that
i
should
be
judged
of
you
or
of
man's
judgment
yea
i
judge
not
mine
own
self
for
i
know
nothing
by
myself
yet
am
i
not
hereby
justified
but
he
that
judgeth
me
is
the
lord
therefore
judge
nothing
before
the
time
until
the
lord
come
who
both
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
and
will
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
hearts
and
then
shall
every
man
have
praise
of
god
and
these
things
brethren
i
have
in
a
figure
transferred
to
myself
and
to
apollos
for
your
sakes
that
ye
might
learn
in
us
not
to
think
of
men
above
that
which
is
written
that
no
one
of
you
be
puffed
up
for
one
against
another
for
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
from
another
and
what
hast
thou
that
thou
didst
not
receive
now
if
thou
didst
receive
it
why
dost
thou
glory
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
it
now
ye
are
full
now
ye
are
rich
ye
have
reigned
as
kings
without
us
and
i
would
to
god
ye
did
reign
that
we
also
might
reign
with
you
for
i
think
that
god
hath
set
forth
us
the
apostles
last
as
it
were
appointed
to
death
for
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
we
are
fools
for
christ's
sake
but
ye
are
wise
in
christ
we
are
weak
but
ye
are
strong
ye
are
honourable
but
we
are
despised
even
unto
this
present
hour
we
both
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
naked
and
are
buffeted
and
have
no
certain
dwellingplace
and
labour
working
with
our
own
hands
being
reviled
we
bless
being
persecuted
we
suffer
it
being
defamed
we
intreat
we
are
made
as
the
filth
of
the
world
and
are
the
offscouring
of
all
things
unto
this
day
i
write
not
these
things
to
shame
you
but
as
my
beloved
sons
i
warn
you
for
though
ye
have
ten
thousand
instructers
in
christ
yet
have
ye
not
many
fathers
for
in
christ
jesus
i
have
begotten
you
through
the
gospel
wherefore
i
beseech
you
be
ye
followers
of
me
for
this
cause
have
i
sent
unto
you
timotheus
who
is
my
beloved
son
and
faithful
in
the
lord
who
shall
bring
you
into
remembrance
of
my
ways
which
be
in
christ
as
i
teach
every
where
in
every
church
now
some
are
puffed
up
as
though
i
would
not
come
to
you
but
i
will
come
to
you
shortly
if
the
lord
will
and
will
know
not
the
speech
of
them
which
are
puffed
up
but
the
power
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
in
word
but
in
power
what
will
ye
shall
i
come
unto
you
with
a
rod
or
in
love
and
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
it
is
reported
commonly
that
there
is
fornication
among
you
and
such
fornication
as
is
not
so
much
as
named
among
the
gentiles
that
one
should
have
his
father's
wife
and
ye
are
puffed
up
and
have
not
rather
mourned
that
he
that
hath
done
this
deed
might
be
taken
away
from
among
you
for
i
verily
as
absent
in
body
but
present
in
spirit
have
judged
already
as
though
i
were
present
concerning
him
that
hath
so
done
this
deed
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
when
ye
are
gathered
together
and
my
spirit
with
the
power
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
deliver
such
an
one
unto
satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
flesh
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
lord
jesus
your
glorying
is
not
good
know
ye
not
that
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
purge
out
therefore
the
old
leaven
that
ye
may
be
a
new
lump
as
ye
are
unleavened
for
even
christ
our
passover
is
sacrificed
for
us
therefore
let
us
keep
the
feast
not
with
old
leaven
neither
with
the
leaven
of
malice
and
wickedness
but
with
the
unleavened
bread
of
sincerity
and
truth
i
wrote
unto
you
in
an
epistle
not
to
company
with
fornicators
yet
not
altogether
with
the
fornicators
of
this
world
or
with
the
covetous
or
extortioners
or
with
idolaters
for
then
must
ye
needs
go
out
of
the
world
but
now
i
have
written
unto
you
not
to
keep
company
if
any
man
that
is
called
a
brother
be
a
fornicator
or
covetous
or
an
idolater
or
a
railer
or
a
drunkard
or
an
extortioner
with
such
an
one
no
not
to
eat
for
what
have
i
to
do
to
judge
them
also
that
are
without
do
not
ye
judge
them
that
are
within
but
them
that
are
without
god
judgeth
therefore
put
away
from
among
yourselves
that
wicked
person
dare
any
of
you
having
a
matter
against
another
go
to
law
before
the
unjust
and
not
before
the
saints
do
ye
not
know
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
world
and
if
the
world
shall
be
judged
by
you
are
ye
unworthy
to
judge
the
smallest
matters
know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
angels
how
much
more
things
that
pertain
to
this
life
if
then
ye
have
judgments
of
things
pertaining
to
this
life
set
them
to
judge
who
are
least
esteemed
in
the
church
i
speak
to
your
shame
is
it
so
that
there
is
not
a
wise
man
among
you
no
not
one
that
shall
be
able
to
judge
between
his
brethren
but
brother
goeth
to
law
with
brother
and
that
before
the
unbelievers
now
therefore
there
is
utterly
a
fault
among
you
because
ye
go
to
law
one
with
another
why
do
ye
not
rather
take
wrong
why
do
ye
not
rather
suffer
yourselves
to
be
defrauded
nay
ye
do
wrong
and
defraud
and
that
your
brethren
know
ye
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
be
not
deceived
neither
fornicators
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
mankind
nor
thieves
nor
covetous
nor
drunkards
nor
revilers
nor
extortioners
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
and
such
were
some
of
you
but
ye
are
washed
but
ye
are
sanctified
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
by
the
spirit
of
our
god
all
things
are
lawful
unto
me
but
all
things
are
not
expedient
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
i
will
not
be
brought
under
the
power
of
any
meats
for
the
belly
and
the
belly
for
meats
but
god
shall
destroy
both
it
and
them
now
the
body
is
not
for
fornication
but
for
the
lord
and
the
lord
for
the
body
and
god
hath
both
raised
up
the
lord
and
will
also
raise
up
us
by
his
own
power
know
ye
not
that
your
bodies
are
the
members
of
christ
shall
i
then
take
the
members
of
christ
and
make
them
the
members
of
an
harlot
god
forbid
what
know
ye
not
that
he
which
is
joined
to
an
harlot
is
one
body
for
two
saith
he
shall
be
one
flesh
but
he
that
is
joined
unto
the
lord
is
one
spirit
flee
fornication
every
sin
that
a
man
doeth
is
without
the
body
but
he
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
body
what
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
in
you
which
ye
have
of
god
and
ye
are
not
your
own
for
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
therefore
glorify
god
in
your
body
and
in
your
spirit
which
are
god's
now
concerning
the
things
whereof
ye
wrote
unto
me
it
is
good
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
nevertheless
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
husband
let
the
husband
render
unto
the
wife
due
benevolence
and
likewise
also
the
wife
unto
the
husband
the
wife
hath
not
power
of
her
own
body
but
the
husband
and
likewise
also
the
husband
hath
not
power
of
his
own
body
but
the
wife
defraud
ye
not
one
the
other
except
it
be
with
consent
for
a
time
that
ye
may
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
prayer
and
come
together
again
that
satan
tempt
you
not
for
your
incontinency
but
i
speak
this
by
permission
and
not
of
commandment
for
i
would
that
all
men
were
even
as
i
myself
but
every
man
hath
his
proper
gift
of
god
one
after
this
manner
and
another
after
that
i
say
therefore
to
the
unmarried
and
widows
it
is
good
for
them
if
they
abide
even
as
i
but
if
they
cannot
contain
let
them
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
burn
and
unto
the
married
i
command
yet
not
i
but
the
lord
let
not
the
wife
depart
from
her
husband
but
and
if
she
depart
let
her
remain
unmarried
or
be
reconciled
to
her
husband
and
let
not
the
husband
put
away
his
wife
but
to
the
rest
speak
i
not
the
lord
if
any
brother
hath
a
wife
that
believeth
not
and
she
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
him
let
him
not
put
her
away
and
the
woman
which
hath
an
husband
that
believeth
not
and
if
he
be
pleased
to
dwell
with
her
let
her
not
leave
him
for
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
by
the
wife
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
by
the
husband
else
were
your
children
unclean
but
now
are
they
holy
but
if
the
unbelieving
depart
let
him
depart
a
brother
or
a
sister
is
not
under
bondage
in
such
cases
but
god
hath
called
us
to
peace
for
what
knowest
thou
o
wife
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
husband
or
how
knowest
thou
o
man
whether
thou
shalt
save
thy
wife
but
as
god
hath
distributed
to
every
man
as
the
lord
hath
called
every
one
so
let
him
walk
and
so
ordain
i
in
all
churches
is
any
man
called
being
circumcised
let
him
not
become
uncircumcised
is
any
called
in
uncircumcision
let
him
not
be
circumcised
circumcision
is
nothing
and
uncircumcision
is
nothing
but
the
keeping
of
the
commandments
of
god
let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
was
called
art
thou
called
being
a
servant
care
not
for
it
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
free
use
it
rather
for
he
that
is
called
in
the
lord
being
a
servant
is
the
lord's
freeman
likewise
also
he
that
is
called
being
free
is
christ's
servant
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
be
not
ye
the
servants
of
men
brethren
let
every
man
wherein
he
is
called
therein
abide
with
god
now
concerning
virgins
i
have
no
commandment
of
the
lord
yet
i
give
my
judgment
as
one
that
hath
obtained
mercy
of
the
lord
to
be
faithful
i
suppose
therefore
that
this
is
good
for
the
present
distress
i
say
that
it
is
good
for
a
man
so
to
be
art
thou
bound
unto
a
wife
seek
not
to
be
loosed
art
thou
loosed
from
a
wife
seek
not
a
wife
but
and
if
thou
marry
thou
hast
not
sinned
and
if
a
virgin
marry
she
hath
not
sinned
nevertheless
such
shall
have
trouble
in
the
flesh
but
i
spare
you
but
this
i
say
brethren
the
time
is
short
it
remaineth
that
both
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
none
and
they
that
weep
as
though
they
wept
not
and
they
that
rejoice
as
though
they
rejoiced
not
and
they
that
buy
as
though
they
possessed
not
and
they
that
use
this
world
as
not
abusing
it
for
the
fashion
of
this
world
passeth
away
but
i
would
have
you
without
carefulness
he
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
lord
how
he
may
please
the
lord
but
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
world
how
he
may
please
his
wife
there
is
difference
also
between
a
wife
and
a
virgin
the
unmarried
woman
careth
for
the
things
of
the
lord
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
but
she
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband
and
this
i
speak
for
your
own
profit
not
that
i
may
cast
a
snare
upon
you
but
for
that
which
is
comely
and
that
ye
may
attend
upon
the
lord
without
distraction
but
if
any
man
think
that
he
behaveth
himself
uncomely
toward
his
virgin
if
she
pass
the
flower
of
her
age
and
need
so
require
let
him
do
what
he
will
he
sinneth
not
let
them
marry
nevertheless
he
that
standeth
stedfast
in
his
heart
having
no
necessity
but
hath
power
over
his
own
will
and
hath
so
decreed
in
his
heart
that
he
will
keep
his
virgin
doeth
well
so
then
he
that
giveth
her
in
marriage
doeth
well
but
he
that
giveth
her
not
in
marriage
doeth
better
the
wife
is
bound
by
the
law
as
long
as
her
husband
liveth
but
if
her
husband
be
dead
she
is
at
liberty
to
be
married
to
whom
she
will
only
in
the
lord
but
she
is
happier
if
she
so
abide
after
my
judgment
and
i
think
also
that
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
now
as
touching
things
offered
unto
idols
we
know
that
we
all
have
knowledge
knowledge
puffeth
up
but
charity
edifieth
and
if
any
man
think
that
he
knoweth
any
thing
he
knoweth
nothing
yet
as
he
ought
to
know
but
if
any
man
love
god
the
same
is
known
of
him
as
concerning
therefore
the
eating
of
those
things
that
are
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothing
in
the
world
and
that
there
is
none
other
god
but
one
for
though
there
be
that
are
called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
in
earth
as
there
be
gods
many
and
lords
many
but
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
of
whom
are
all
things
and
we
in
him
and
one
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
are
all
things
and
we
by
him
howbeit
there
is
not
in
every
man
that
knowledge
for
some
with
conscience
of
the
idol
unto
this
hour
eat
it
as
a
thing
offered
unto
an
idol
and
their
conscience
being
weak
is
defiled
but
meat
commendeth
us
not
to
god
for
neither
if
we
eat
are
we
the
better
neither
if
we
eat
not
are
we
the
worse
but
take
heed
lest
by
any
means
this
liberty
of
your's
become
a
stumblingblock
to
them
that
are
weak
for
if
any
man
see
thee
which
hast
knowledge
sit
at
meat
in
the
idol's
temple
shall
not
the
conscience
of
him
which
is
weak
be
emboldened
to
eat
those
things
which
are
offered
to
idols
and
through
thy
knowledge
shall
the
weak
brother
perish
for
whom
christ
died
but
when
ye
sin
so
against
the
brethren
and
wound
their
weak
conscience
ye
sin
against
christ
wherefore
if
meat
make
my
brother
to
offend
i
will
eat
no
flesh
while
the
world
standeth
lest
i
make
my
brother
to
offend
am
i
not
an
apostle
am
i
not
free
have
i
not
seen
jesus
christ
our
lord
are
not
ye
my
work
in
the
lord
if
i
be
not
an
apostle
unto
others
yet
doubtless
i
am
to
you
for
the
seal
of
mine
apostleship
are
ye
in
the
lord
mine
answer
to
them
that
do
examine
me
is
this
have
we
not
power
to
eat
and
to
drink
have
we
not
power
to
lead
about
a
sister
a
wife
as
well
as
other
apostles
and
as
the
brethren
of
the
lord
and
cephas
or
i
only
and
barnabas
have
not
we
power
to
forbear
working
who
goeth
a
warfare
any
time
at
his
own
charges
who
planteth
a
vineyard
and
eateth
not
of
the
fruit
thereof
or
who
feedeth
a
flock
and
eateth
not
of
the
milk
of
the
flock
say
i
these
things
as
a
man
or
saith
not
the
law
the
same
also
for
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
mouth
of
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
doth
god
take
care
for
oxen
or
saith
he
it
altogether
for
our
sakes
for
our
sakes
no
doubt
this
is
written
that
he
that
ploweth
should
plow
in
hope
and
that
he
that
thresheth
in
hope
should
be
partaker
of
his
hope
if
we
have
sown
unto
you
spiritual
things
is
it
a
great
thing
if
we
shall
reap
your
carnal
things
if
others
be
partakers
of
this
power
over
you
are
not
we
rather
nevertheless
we
have
not
used
this
power
but
suffer
all
things
lest
we
should
hinder
the
gospel
of
christ
do
ye
not
know
that
they
which
minister
about
holy
things
live
of
the
things
of
the
temple
and
they
which
wait
at
the
altar
are
partakers
with
the
altar
even
so
hath
the
lord
ordained
that
they
which
preach
the
gospel
should
live
of
the
gospel
but
i
have
used
none
of
these
things
neither
have
i
written
these
things
that
it
should
be
so
done
unto
me
for
it
were
better
for
me
to
die
than
that
any
man
should
make
my
glorying
void
for
though
i
preach
the
gospel
i
have
nothing
to
glory
of
for
necessity
is
laid
upon
me
yea
woe
is
unto
me
if
i
preach
not
the
gospel
for
if
i
do
this
thing
willingly
i
have
a
reward
but
if
against
my
will
a
dispensation
of
the
gospel
is
committed
unto
me
what
is
my
reward
then
verily
that
when
i
preach
the
gospel
i
may
make
the
gospel
of
christ
without
charge
that
i
abuse
not
my
power
in
the
gospel
for
though
i
be
free
from
all
men
yet
have
i
made
myself
servant
unto
all
that
i
might
gain
the
more
and
unto
the
jews
i
became
as
a
jew
that
i
might
gain
the
jews
to
them
that
are
under
the
law
as
under
the
law
that
i
might
gain
them
that
are
under
the
law
to
them
that
are
without
law
as
without
law
being
not
without
law
to
god
but
under
the
law
to
christ
that
i
might
gain
them
that
are
without
law
to
the
weak
became
i
as
weak
that
i
might
gain
the
weak
i
am
made
all
things
to
all
men
that
i
might
by
all
means
save
some
and
this
i
do
for
the
gospel's
sake
that
i
might
be
partaker
thereof
with
you
know
ye
not
that
they
which
run
in
a
race
run
all
but
one
receiveth
the
prize
so
run
that
ye
may
obtain
and
every
man
that
striveth
for
the
mastery
is
temperate
in
all
things
now
they
do
it
to
obtain
a
corruptible
crown
but
we
an
incorruptible
i
therefore
so
run
not
as
uncertainly
so
fight
i
not
as
one
that
beateth
the
air
but
i
keep
under
my
body
and
bring
it
into
subjection
lest
that
by
any
means
when
i
have
preached
to
others
i
myself
should
be
a
castaway
moreover
brethren
i
would
not
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
and
were
all
baptized
unto
moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
was
christ
but
with
many
of
them
god
was
not
well
pleased
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
wilderness
now
these
things
were
our
examples
to
the
intent
we
should
not
lust
after
evil
things
as
they
also
lusted
neither
be
ye
idolaters
as
were
some
of
them
as
it
is
written
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
and
rose
up
to
play
neither
let
us
commit
fornication
as
some
of
them
committed
and
fell
in
one
day
three
and
twenty
thousand
neither
let
us
tempt
christ
as
some
of
them
also
tempted
and
were
destroyed
of
serpents
neither
murmur
ye
as
some
of
them
also
murmured
and
were
destroyed
of
the
destroyer
now
all
these
things
happened
unto
them
for
ensamples
and
they
are
written
for
our
admonition
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
world
are
come
wherefore
let
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
there
hath
no
temptation
taken
you
but
such
as
is
common
to
man
but
god
is
faithful
who
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
tempted
above
that
ye
are
able
but
will
with
the
temptation
also
make
a
way
to
escape
that
ye
may
be
able
to
bear
it
wherefore
my
dearly
beloved
flee
from
idolatry
i
speak
as
to
wise
men
judge
ye
what
i
say
the
cup
of
blessing
which
we
bless
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
blood
of
christ
the
bread
which
we
break
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
body
of
christ
for
we
being
many
are
one
bread
and
one
body
for
we
are
all
partakers
of
that
one
bread
behold
israel
after
the
flesh
are
not
they
which
eat
of
the
sacrifices
partakers
of
the
altar
what
say
i
then
that
the
idol
is
any
thing
or
that
which
is
offered
in
sacrifice
to
idols
is
any
thing
but
i
say
that
the
things
which
the
gentiles
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
to
devils
and
not
to
god
and
i
would
not
that
ye
should
have
fellowship
with
devils
ye
cannot
drink
the
cup
of
the
lord
and
the
cup
of
devils
ye
cannot
be
partakers
of
the
lord's
table
and
of
the
table
of
devils
do
we
provoke
the
lord
to
jealousy
are
we
stronger
than
he
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
all
things
are
not
expedient
all
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
all
things
edify
not
let
no
man
seek
his
own
but
every
man
another's
wealth
whatsoever
is
sold
in
the
shambles
that
eat
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake
for
the
earth
is
the
lord's
and
the
fulness
thereof
if
any
of
them
that
believe
not
bid
you
to
a
feast
and
ye
be
disposed
to
go
whatsoever
is
set
before
you
eat
asking
no
question
for
conscience
sake
but
if
any
man
say
unto
you
this
is
offered
in
sacrifice
unto
idols
eat
not
for
his
sake
that
shewed
it
and
for
conscience
sake
for
the
earth
is
the
lord's
and
the
fulness
thereof
conscience
i
say
not
thine
own
but
of
the
other
for
why
is
my
liberty
judged
of
another
man's
conscience
for
if
i
by
grace
be
a
partaker
why
am
i
evil
spoken
of
for
that
for
which
i
give
thanks
whether
therefore
ye
eat
or
drink
or
whatsoever
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
give
none
offence
neither
to
the
jews
nor
to
the
gentiles
nor
to
the
church
of
god
even
as
i
please
all
men
in
all
things
not
seeking
mine
own
profit
but
the
profit
of
many
that
they
may
be
saved
be
ye
followers
of
me
even
as
i
also
am
of
christ
now
i
praise
you
brethren
that
ye
remember
me
in
all
things
and
keep
the
ordinances
as
i
delivered
them
to
you
but
i
would
have
you
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
christ
and
the
head
of
the
woman
is
the
man
and
the
head
of
christ
is
god
every
man
praying
or
prophesying
having
his
head
covered
dishonoureth
his
head
but
every
woman
that
prayeth
or
prophesieth
with
her
head
uncovered
dishonoureth
her
head
for
that
is
even
all
one
as
if
she
were
shaven
for
if
the
woman
be
not
covered
let
her
also
be
shorn
but
if
it
be
a
shame
for
a
woman
to
be
shorn
or
shaven
let
her
be
covered
for
a
man
indeed
ought
not
to
cover
his
head
forasmuch
as
he
is
the
image
and
glory
of
god
but
the
woman
is
the
glory
of
the
man
for
the
man
is
not
of
the
woman
but
the
woman
of
the
man
neither
was
the
man
created
for
the
woman
but
the
woman
for
the
man
for
this
cause
ought
the
woman
to
have
power
on
her
head
because
of
the
angels
nevertheless
neither
is
the
man
without
the
woman
neither
the
woman
without
the
man
in
the
lord
for
as
the
woman
is
of
the
man
even
so
is
the
man
also
by
the
woman
but
all
things
of
god
judge
in
yourselves
is
it
comely
that
a
woman
pray
unto
god
uncovered
doth
not
even
nature
itself
teach
you
that
if
a
man
have
long
hair
it
is
a
shame
unto
him
but
if
a
woman
have
long
hair
it
is
a
glory
to
her
for
her
hair
is
given
her
for
a
covering
but
if
any
man
seem
to
be
contentious
we
have
no
such
custom
neither
the
churches
of
god
now
in
this
that
i
declare
unto
you
i
praise
you
not
that
ye
come
together
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
for
first
of
all
when
ye
come
together
in
the
church
i
hear
that
there
be
divisions
among
you
and
i
partly
believe
it
for
there
must
be
also
heresies
among
you
that
they
which
are
approved
may
be
made
manifest
among
you
when
ye
come
together
therefore
into
one
place
this
is
not
to
eat
the
lord's
supper
for
in
eating
every
one
taketh
before
other
his
own
supper
and
one
is
hungry
and
another
is
drunken
what
have
ye
not
houses
to
eat
and
to
drink
in
or
despise
ye
the
church
of
god
and
shame
them
that
have
not
what
shall
i
say
to
you
shall
i
praise
you
in
this
i
praise
you
not
for
i
have
received
of
the
lord
that
which
also
i
delivered
unto
you
that
the
lord
jesus
the
same
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
bread
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
brake
it
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
which
is
broken
for
you
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
after
the
same
manner
also
he
took
the
cup
when
he
had
supped
saying
this
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood
this
do
ye
as
oft
as
ye
drink
it
in
remembrance
of
me
for
as
often
as
ye
eat
this
bread
and
drink
this
cup
ye
do
shew
the
lord's
death
till
he
come
wherefore
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread
and
drink
this
cup
of
the
lord
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
lord
but
let
a
man
examine
himself
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
bread
and
drink
of
that
cup
for
he
that
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
himself
not
discerning
the
lord's
body
for
this
cause
many
are
weak
and
sickly
among
you
and
many
sleep
for
if
we
would
judge
ourselves
we
should
not
be
judged
but
when
we
are
judged
we
are
chastened
of
the
lord
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
world
wherefore
my
brethren
when
ye
come
together
to
eat
tarry
one
for
another
and
if
any
man
hunger
let
him
eat
at
home
that
ye
come
not
together
unto
condemnation
and
the
rest
will
i
set
in
order
when
i
come
now
concerning
spiritual
gifts
brethren
i
would
not
have
you
ignorant
ye
know
that
ye
were
gentiles
carried
away
unto
these
dumb
idols
even
as
ye
were
led
wherefore
i
give
you
to
understand
that
no
man
speaking
by
the
spirit
of
god
calleth
jesus
accursed
and
that
no
man
can
say
that
jesus
is
the
lord
but
by
the
holy
ghost
now
there
are
diversities
of
gifts
but
the
same
spirit
and
there
are
differences
of
administrations
but
the
same
lord
and
there
are
diversities
of
operations
but
it
is
the
same
god
which
worketh
all
in
all
but
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
is
given
to
every
man
to
profit
withal
for
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
the
word
of
wisdom
to
another
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
spirit
to
another
faith
by
the
same
spirit
to
another
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
spirit
to
another
the
working
of
miracles
to
another
prophecy
to
another
discerning
of
spirits
to
another
divers
kinds
of
tongues
to
another
the
interpretation
of
tongues
but
all
these
worketh
that
one
and
the
selfsame
spirit
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
will
for
as
the
body
is
one
and
hath
many
members
and
all
the
members
of
that
one
body
being
many
are
one
body
so
also
is
christ
for
by
one
spirit
are
we
all
baptized
into
one
body
whether
we
be
jews
or
gentiles
whether
we
be
bond
or
free
and
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into
one
spirit
for
the
body
is
not
one
member
but
many
if
the
foot
shall
say
because
i
am
not
the
hand
i
am
not
of
the
body
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body
and
if
the
ear
shall
say
because
i
am
not
the
eye
i
am
not
of
the
body
is
it
therefore
not
of
the
body
if
the
whole
body
were
an
eye
where
were
the
hearing
if
the
whole
were
hearing
where
were
the
smelling
but
now
hath
god
set
the
members
every
one
of
them
in
the
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
if
they
were
all
one
member
where
were
the
body
but
now
are
they
many
members
yet
but
one
body
and
the
eye
cannot
say
unto
the
hand
i
have
no
need
of
thee
nor
again
the
head
to
the
feet
i
have
no
need
of
you
nay
much
more
those
members
of
the
body
which
seem
to
be
more
feeble
are
necessary
and
those
members
of
the
body
which
we
think
to
be
less
honourable
upon
these
we
bestow
more
abundant
honour
and
our
uncomely
parts
have
more
abundant
comeliness
for
our
comely
parts
have
no
need
but
god
hath
tempered
the
body
together
having
given
more
abundant
honour
to
that
part
which
lacked
that
there
should
be
no
schism
in
the
body
but
that
the
members
should
have
the
same
care
one
for
another
and
whether
one
member
suffer
all
the
members
suffer
with
it
or
one
member
be
honoured
all
the
members
rejoice
with
it
now
ye
are
the
body
of
christ
and
members
in
particular
and
god
hath
set
some
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondarily
prophets
thirdly
teachers
after
that
miracles
then
gifts
of
healings
helps
governments
diversities
of
tongues
are
all
apostles
are
all
prophets
are
all
teachers
are
all
workers
of
miracles
have
all
the
gifts
of
healing
do
all
speak
with
tongues
do
all
interpret
but
covet
earnestly
the
best
gifts
and
yet
shew
i
unto
you
a
more
excellent
way
though
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
have
not
charity
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
or
a
tinkling
cymbal
and
though
i
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
understand
all
mysteries
and
all
knowledge
and
though
i
have
all
faith
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
and
though
i
bestow
all
my
goods
to
feed
the
poor
and
though
i
give
my
body
to
be
burned
and
have
not
charity
it
profiteth
me
nothing
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
charity
envieth
not
charity
vaunteth
not
itself
is
not
puffed
up
doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
rejoiceth
not
in
iniquity
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
charity
never
faileth
but
whether
there
be
prophecies
they
shall
fail
whether
there
be
tongues
they
shall
cease
whether
there
be
knowledge
it
shall
vanish
away
for
we
know
in
part
and
we
prophesy
in
part
but
when
that
which
is
perfect
is
come
then
that
which
is
in
part
shall
be
done
away
when
i
was
a
child
i
spake
as
a
child
i
understood
as
a
child
i
thought
as
a
child
but
when
i
became
a
man
i
put
away
childish
things
for
now
we
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
now
i
know
in
part
but
then
shall
i
know
even
as
also
i
am
known
and
now
abideth
faith
hope
charity
these
three
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
follow
after
charity
and
desire
spiritual
gifts
but
rather
that
ye
may
prophesy
for
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
speaketh
not
unto
men
but
unto
god
for
no
man
understandeth
him
howbeit
in
the
spirit
he
speaketh
mysteries
but
he
that
prophesieth
speaketh
unto
men
to
edification
and
exhortation
and
comfort
he
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
edifieth
himself
but
he
that
prophesieth
edifieth
the
church
i
would
that
ye
all
spake
with
tongues
but
rather
that
ye
prophesied
for
greater
is
he
that
prophesieth
than
he
that
speaketh
with
tongues
except
he
interpret
that
the
church
may
receive
edifying
now
brethren
if
i
come
unto
you
speaking
with
tongues
what
shall
i
profit
you
except
i
shall
speak
to
you
either
by
revelation
or
by
knowledge
or
by
prophesying
or
by
doctrine
and
even
things
without
life
giving
sound
whether
pipe
or
harp
except
they
give
a
distinction
in
the
sounds
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
piped
or
harped
for
if
the
trumpet
give
an
uncertain
sound
who
shall
prepare
himself
to
the
battle
so
likewise
ye
except
ye
utter
by
the
tongue
words
easy
to
be
understood
how
shall
it
be
known
what
is
spoken
for
ye
shall
speak
into
the
air
there
are
it
may
be
so
many
kinds
of
voices
in
the
world
and
none
of
them
is
without
signification
therefore
if
i
know
not
the
meaning
of
the
voice
i
shall
be
unto
him
that
speaketh
a
barbarian
and
he
that
speaketh
shall
be
a
barbarian
unto
me
even
so
ye
forasmuch
as
ye
are
zealous
of
spiritual
gifts
seek
that
ye
may
excel
to
the
edifying
of
the
church
wherefore
let
him
that
speaketh
in
an
unknown
tongue
pray
that
he
may
interpret
for
if
i
pray
in
an
unknown
tongue
my
spirit
prayeth
but
my
understanding
is
unfruitful
what
is
it
then
i
will
pray
with
the
spirit
and
i
will
pray
with
the
understanding
also
i
will
sing
with
the
spirit
and
i
will
sing
with
the
understanding
also
else
when
thou
shalt
bless
with
the
spirit
how
shall
he
that
occupieth
the
room
of
the
unlearned
say
amen
at
thy
giving
of
thanks
seeing
he
understandeth
not
what
thou
sayest
for
thou
verily
givest
thanks
well
but
the
other
is
not
edified
i
thank
my
god
i
speak
with
tongues
more
than
ye
all
yet
in
the
church
i
had
rather
speak
five
words
with
my
understanding
that
by
my
voice
i
might
teach
others
also
than
ten
thousand
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
brethren
be
not
children
in
understanding
howbeit
in
malice
be
ye
children
but
in
understanding
be
men
in
the
law
it
is
written
with
men
of
other
tongues
and
other
lips
will
i
speak
unto
this
people
and
yet
for
all
that
will
they
not
hear
me
saith
the
lord
wherefore
tongues
are
for
a
sign
not
to
them
that
believe
but
to
them
that
believe
not
but
prophesying
serveth
not
for
them
that
believe
not
but
for
them
which
believe
if
therefore
the
whole
church
be
come
together
into
one
place
and
all
speak
with
tongues
and
there
come
in
those
that
are
unlearned
or
unbelievers
will
they
not
say
that
ye
are
mad
but
if
all
prophesy
and
there
come
in
one
that
believeth
not
or
one
unlearned
he
is
convinced
of
all
he
is
judged
of
all
and
thus
are
the
secrets
of
his
heart
made
manifest
and
so
falling
down
on
his
face
he
will
worship
god
and
report
that
god
is
in
you
of
a
truth
how
is
it
then
brethren
when
ye
come
together
every
one
of
you
hath
a
psalm
hath
a
doctrine
hath
a
tongue
hath
a
revelation
hath
an
interpretation
let
all
things
be
done
unto
edifying
if
any
man
speak
in
an
unknown
tongue
let
it
be
by
two
or
at
the
most
by
three
and
that
by
course
and
let
one
interpret
but
if
there
be
no
interpreter
let
him
keep
silence
in
the
church
and
let
him
speak
to
himself
and
to
god
let
the
prophets
speak
two
or
three
and
let
the
other
judge
if
any
thing
be
revealed
to
another
that
sitteth
by
let
the
first
hold
his
peace
for
ye
may
all
prophesy
one
by
one
that
all
may
learn
and
all
may
be
comforted
and
the
spirits
of
the
prophets
are
subject
to
the
prophets
for
god
is
not
the
author
of
confusion
but
of
peace
as
in
all
churches
of
the
saints
let
your
women
keep
silence
in
the
churches
for
it
is
not
permitted
unto
them
to
speak
but
they
are
commanded
to
be
under
obedience
as
also
saith
the
law
and
if
they
will
learn
any
thing
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
home
for
it
is
a
shame
for
women
to
speak
in
the
church
what
came
the
word
of
god
out
from
you
or
came
it
unto
you
only
if
any
man
think
himself
to
be
a
prophet
or
spiritual
let
him
acknowledge
that
the
things
that
i
write
unto
you
are
the
commandments
of
the
lord
but
if
any
man
be
ignorant
let
him
be
ignorant
wherefore
brethren
covet
to
prophesy
and
forbid
not
to
speak
with
tongues
let
all
things
be
done
decently
and
in
order
moreover
brethren
i
declare
unto
you
the
gospel
which
i
preached
unto
you
which
also
ye
have
received
and
wherein
ye
stand
by
which
also
ye
are
saved
if
ye
keep
in
memory
what
i
preached
unto
you
unless
ye
have
believed
in
vain
for
i
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
i
also
received
how
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scriptures
and
that
he
was
buried
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
scriptures
and
that
he
was
seen
of
cephas
then
of
the
twelve
after
that
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
once
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
present
but
some
are
fallen
asleep
after
that
he
was
seen
of
james
then
of
all
the
apostles
and
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
also
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
time
for
i
am
the
least
of
the
apostles
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
apostle
because
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
what
i
am
and
his
grace
which
was
bestowed
upon
me
was
not
in
vain
but
i
laboured
more
abundantly
than
they
all
yet
not
i
but
the
grace
of
god
which
was
with
me
therefore
whether
it
were
i
or
they
so
we
preach
and
so
ye
believed
now
if
christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
dead
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
then
is
christ
not
risen
and
if
christ
be
not
risen
then
is
our
preaching
vain
and
your
faith
is
also
vain
yea
and
we
are
found
false
witnesses
of
god
because
we
have
testified
of
god
that
he
raised
up
christ
whom
he
raised
not
up
if
so
be
that
the
dead
rise
not
for
if
the
dead
rise
not
then
is
not
christ
raised
and
if
christ
be
not
raised
your
faith
is
vain
ye
are
yet
in
your
sins
then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
christ
are
perished
if
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
christ
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable
but
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
and
become
the
firstfruits
of
them
that
slept
for
since
by
man
came
death
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
for
as
in
adam
all
die
even
so
in
christ
shall
all
be
made
alive
but
every
man
in
his
own
order
christ
the
firstfruits
afterward
they
that
are
christ's
at
his
coming
then
cometh
the
end
when
he
shall
have
delivered
up
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
father
when
he
shall
have
put
down
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
for
he
must
reign
till
he
hath
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
for
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
but
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
him
it
is
manifest
that
he
is
excepted
which
did
put
all
things
under
him
and
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
him
then
shall
the
son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
under
him
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all
why
are
they
then
baptized
for
the
dead
and
why
stand
we
in
jeopardy
every
hour
i
protest
by
your
rejoicing
which
i
have
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
i
die
daily
if
after
the
manner
of
men
i
have
fought
with
beasts
at
ephesus
what
advantageth
it
me
if
the
dead
rise
not
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
to
morrow
we
die
be
not
deceived
evil
communications
corrupt
good
manners
awake
to
righteousness
and
sin
not
for
some
have
not
the
knowledge
of
god
i
speak
this
to
your
shame
but
some
man
will
say
how
are
the
dead
raised
up
and
with
what
body
do
they
come
thou
fool
that
which
thou
sowest
is
not
quickened
except
it
die
and
that
which
thou
sowest
thou
sowest
not
that
body
that
shall
be
but
bare
grain
it
may
chance
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
grain
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body
all
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
but
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
men
another
flesh
of
beasts
another
of
fishes
and
another
of
birds
there
are
also
celestial
bodies
and
bodies
terrestrial
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
there
is
one
glory
of
the
sun
and
another
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
glory
of
the
stars
for
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory
so
also
is
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
it
is
sown
in
corruption
it
is
raised
in
incorruption
it
is
sown
in
dishonour
it
is
raised
in
glory
it
is
sown
in
weakness
it
is
raised
in
power
it
is
sown
a
natural
body
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
body
there
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
and
so
it
is
written
the
first
man
adam
was
made
a
living
soul
the
last
adam
was
made
a
quickening
spirit
howbeit
that
was
not
first
which
is
spiritual
but
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual
the
first
man
is
of
the
earth
earthy
the
second
man
is
the
lord
from
heaven
as
is
the
earthy
such
are
they
also
that
are
earthy
and
as
is
the
heavenly
such
are
they
also
that
are
heavenly
and
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
earthy
we
shall
also
bear
the
image
of
the
heavenly
now
this
i
say
brethren
that
flesh
and
blood
cannot
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
doth
corruption
inherit
incorruption
behold
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
sleep
but
we
shall
all
be
changed
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
at
the
last
trump
for
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
we
shall
be
changed
for
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
the
sting
of
death
is
sin
and
the
strength
of
sin
is
the
law
but
thanks
be
to
god
which
giveth
us
the
victory
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
therefore
my
beloved
brethren
be
ye
stedfast
unmoveable
always
abounding
in
the
work
of
the
lord
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
your
labour
is
not
in
vain
in
the
lord
now
concerning
the
collection
for
the
saints
as
i
have
given
order
to
the
churches
of
galatia
even
so
do
ye
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
let
every
one
of
you
lay
by
him
in
store
as
god
hath
prospered
him
that
there
be
no
gatherings
when
i
come
and
when
i
come
whomsoever
ye
shall
approve
by
your
letters
them
will
i
send
to
bring
your
liberality
unto
jerusalem
and
if
it
be
meet
that
i
go
also
they
shall
go
with
me
now
i
will
come
unto
you
when
i
shall
pass
through
macedonia
for
i
do
pass
through
macedonia
and
it
may
be
that
i
will
abide
yea
and
winter
with
you
that
ye
may
bring
me
on
my
journey
whithersoever
i
go
for
i
will
not
see
you
now
by
the
way
but
i
trust
to
tarry
a
while
with
you
if
the
lord
permit
but
i
will
tarry
at
ephesus
until
pentecost
for
a
great
door
and
effectual
is
opened
unto
me
and
there
are
many
adversaries
now
if
timotheus
come
see
that
he
may
be
with
you
without
fear
for
he
worketh
the
work
of
the
lord
as
i
also
do
let
no
man
therefore
despise
him
but
conduct
him
forth
in
peace
that
he
may
come
unto
me
for
i
look
for
him
with
the
brethren
as
touching
our
brother
apollos
i
greatly
desired
him
to
come
unto
you
with
the
brethren
but
his
will
was
not
at
all
to
come
at
this
time
but
he
will
come
when
he
shall
have
convenient
time
watch
ye
stand
fast
in
the
faith
quit
you
like
men
be
strong
let
all
your
things
be
done
with
charity
i
beseech
you
brethren
ye
know
the
house
of
stephanas
that
it
is
the
firstfruits
of
achaia
and
that
they
have
addicted
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
saints
that
ye
submit
yourselves
unto
such
and
to
every
one
that
helpeth
with
us
and
laboureth
i
am
glad
of
the
coming
of
stephanas
and
fortunatus
and
achaicus
for
that
which
was
lacking
on
your
part
they
have
supplied
for
they
have
refreshed
my
spirit
and
your's
therefore
acknowledge
ye
them
that
are
such
the
churches
of
asia
salute
you
aquila
and
priscilla
salute
you
much
in
the
lord
with
the
church
that
is
in
their
house
all
the
brethren
greet
you
greet
ye
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss
the
salutation
of
me
paul
with
mine
own
hand
if
any
man
love
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
let
him
be
anathema
maranatha
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
you
my
love
be
with
you
all
in

amen
the
second
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
corinthians
paul
an
apostle
of
jesus

by
the
will
of
god
and
timothy
our
brother
unto
the
church
of

which
is
at
corinth
with
all
the
saints
which
are
in
all
achaia
grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
from
the
lord
jesus
christ
blessed
be
god
even
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
father
of
mercies
and
the
god
of
all
comfort
who
comforteth
us
in
all
our
tribulation
that
we
may
be
able
to
comfort
them
which
are
in
any
trouble
by
the
comfort
wherewith
we
ourselves
are
comforted
of
god
for
as
the
sufferings
of
christ
abound
in
us
so
our
consolation
also
aboundeth
by
christ
and
whether
we
be
afflicted
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation
which
is
effectual
in
the
enduring
of
the
same
sufferings
which
we
also
suffer
or
whether
we
be
comforted
it
is
for
your
consolation
and
salvation
and
our
hope
of
you
is
stedfast
knowing
that
as
ye
are
partakers
of
the
sufferings
so
shall
ye
be
also
of
the
consolation
for
we
would
not
brethren
have
you
ignorant
of
our
trouble
which
came
to
us
in
asia
that
we
were
pressed
out
of
measure
above
strength
insomuch
that
we
despaired
even
of
life
but
we
had
the
sentence
of
death
in
ourselves
that
we
should
not
trust
in
ourselves
but
in
god
which
raiseth
the
dead
who
delivered
us
from
so
great
a
death
and
doth
deliver
in
whom
we
trust
that
he
will
yet
deliver
us
ye
also
helping
together
by
prayer
for
us
that
for
the
gift
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
means
of
many
persons
thanks
may
be
given
by
many
on
our
behalf
for
our
rejoicing
is
this
the
testimony
of
our
conscience
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
but
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
had
our
conversation
in
the
world
and
more
abundantly
to
you-ward
for
we
write
none
other
things
unto
you
than
what
ye
read
or
acknowledge
and
i
trust
ye
shall
acknowledge
even
to
the
end
as
also
ye
have
acknowledged
us
in
part
that
we
are
your
rejoicing
even
as
ye
also
are
our's
in
the
day
of
the
lord
jesus
and
in
this
confidence
i
was
minded
to
come
unto
you
before
that
ye
might
have
a
second
benefit
and
to
pass
by
you
into
macedonia
and
to
come
again
out
of
macedonia
unto
you
and
of
you
to
be
brought
on
my
way
toward
judaea
when
i
therefore
was
thus
minded
did
i
use
lightness
or
the
things
that
i
purpose
do
i
purpose
according
to
the
flesh
that
with
me
there
should
be
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
but
as
god
is
true
our
word
toward
you
was
not
yea
and
nay
for
the
son
of
god
jesus
christ
who
was
preached
among
you
by
us
even
by
me
and
silvanus
and
timotheus
was
not
yea
and
nay
but
in
him
was
yea
for
all
the
promises
of
god
in
him
are
yea
and
in
him
amen
unto
the
glory
of
god
by
us
now
he
which
stablisheth
us
with
you
in
christ
and
hath
anointed
us
is
god
who
hath
also
sealed
us
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
in
our
hearts
moreover
i
call
god
for
a
record
upon
my
soul
that
to
spare
you
i
came
not
as
yet
unto
corinth
not
for
that
we
have
dominion
over
your
faith
but
are
helpers
of
your
joy
for
by
faith
ye
stand
but
i
determined
this
with
myself
that
i
would
not
come
again
to
you
in
heaviness
for
if
i
make
you
sorry
who
is
he
then
that
maketh
me
glad
but
the
same
which
is
made
sorry
by
me
and
i
wrote
this
same
unto
you
lest
when
i
came
i
should
have
sorrow
from
them
of
whom
i
ought
to
rejoice
having
confidence
in
you
all
that
my
joy
is
the
joy
of
you
all
for
out
of
much
affliction
and
anguish
of
heart
i
wrote
unto
you
with
many
tears
not
that
ye
should
be
grieved
but
that
ye
might
know
the
love
which
i
have
more
abundantly
unto
you
but
if
any
have
caused
grief
he
hath
not
grieved
me
but
in
part
that
i
may
not
overcharge
you
all
sufficient
to
such
a
man
is
this
punishment
which
was
inflicted
of
many
so
that
contrariwise
ye
ought
rather
to
forgive
him
and
comfort
him
lest
perhaps
such
a
one
should
be
swallowed
up
with
overmuch
sorrow
wherefore
i
beseech
you
that
ye
would
confirm
your
love
toward
him
for
to
this
end
also
did
i
write
that
i
might
know
the
proof
of
you
whether
ye
be
obedient
in
all
things
to
whom
ye
forgive
any
thing
i
forgive
also
for
if
i
forgave
any
thing
to
whom
i
forgave
it
for
your
sakes
forgave
i
it
in
the
person
of
christ
lest
satan
should
get
an
advantage
of
us
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
his
devices
furthermore
when
i
came
to
troas
to
preach
christ's
gospel
and
a
door
was
opened
unto
me
of
the
lord
i
had
no
rest
in
my
spirit
because
i
found
not
titus
my
brother
but
taking
my
leave
of
them
i
went
from
thence
into
macedonia
now
thanks
be
unto
god
which
always
causeth
us
to
triumph
in
christ
and
maketh
manifest
the
savour
of
his
knowledge
by
us
in
every
place
for
we
are
unto
god
a
sweet
savour
of
christ
in
them
that
are
saved
and
in
them
that
perish
to
the
one
we
are
the
savour
of
death
unto
death
and
to
the
other
the
savour
of
life
unto
life
and
who
is
sufficient
for
these
things
for
we
are
not
as
many
which
corrupt
the
word
of
god
but
as
of
sincerity
but
as
of
god
in
the
sight
of
god
speak
we
in
christ
do
we
begin
again
to
commend
ourselves
or
need
we
as
some
others
epistles
of
commendation
to
you
or
letters
of
commendation
from
you
ye
are
our
epistle
written
in
our
hearts
known
and
read
of
all
men
forasmuch
as
ye
are
manifestly
declared
to
be
the
epistle
of
christ
ministered
by
us
written
not
with
ink
but
with
the
spirit
of
the
living
god
not
in
tables
of
stone
but
in
fleshy
tables
of
the
heart
and
such
trust
have
we
through
christ
to
god-ward
not
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
think
any
thing
as
of
ourselves
but
our
sufficiency
is
of
god
who
also
hath
made
us
able
ministers
of
the
new
testament
not
of
the
letter
but
of
the
spirit
for
the
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
but
if
the
ministration
of
death
written
and
engraven
in
stones
was
glorious
so
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
behold
the
face
of
moses
for
the
glory
of
his
countenance
which
glory
was
to
be
done
away
how
shall
not
the
ministration
of
the
spirit
be
rather
glorious
for
if
the
ministration
of
condemnation
be
glory
much
more
doth
the
ministration
of
righteousness
exceed
in
glory
for
even
that
which
was
made
glorious
had
no
glory
in
this
respect
by
reason
of
the
glory
that
excelleth
for
if
that
which
is
done
away
was
glorious
much
more
that
which
remaineth
is
glorious
seeing
then
that
we
have
such
hope
we
use
great
plainness
of
speech
and
not
as
moses
which
put
a
vail
over
his
face
that
the
children
of
israel
could
not
stedfastly
look
to
the
end
of
that
which
is
abolished
but
their
minds
were
blinded
for
until
this
day
remaineth
the
same
vail
untaken
away
in
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
which
vail
is
done
away
in
christ
but
even
unto
this
day
when
moses
is
read
the
vail
is
upon
their
heart
nevertheless
when
it
shall
turn
to
the
lord
the
vail
shall
be
taken
away
now
the
lord
is
that
spirit
and
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
there
is
liberty
but
we
all
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
lord
are
changed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
to
glory
even
as
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
therefore
seeing
we
have
this
ministry
as
we
have
received
mercy
we
faint
not
but
have
renounced
the
hidden
things
of
dishonesty
not
walking
in
craftiness
nor
handling
the
word
of
god
deceitfully
but
by
manifestation
of
the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
man's
conscience
in
the
sight
of
god
but
if
our
gospel
be
hid
it
is
hid
to
them
that
are
lost
in
whom
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
who
is
the
image
of
god
should
shine
unto
them
for
we
preach
not
ourselves
but
christ
jesus
the
lord
and
ourselves
your
servants
for
jesus
sake
for
god
who
commanded
the
light
to
shine
out
of
darkness
hath
shined
in
our
hearts
to
give
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
in
the
face
of
jesus
christ
but
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
vessels
that
the
excellency
of
the
power
may
be
of
god
and
not
of
us
we
are
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
we
are
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
always
bearing
about
in
the
body
the
dying
of
the
lord
jesus
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
body
for
we
which
live
are
alway
delivered
unto
death
for
jesus
sake
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
mortal
flesh
so
then
death
worketh
in
us
but
life
in
you
we
having
the
same
spirit
of
faith
according
as
it
is
written
i
believed
and
therefore
have
i
spoken
we
also
believe
and
therefore
speak
knowing
that
he
which
raised
up
the
lord
jesus
shall
raise
up
us
also
by
jesus
and
shall
present
us
with
you
for
all
things
are
for
your
sakes
that
the
abundant
grace
might
through
the
thanksgiving
of
many
redound
to
the
glory
of
god
for
which
cause
we
faint
not
but
though
our
outward
man
perish
yet
the
inward
man
is
renewed
day
by
day
for
our
light
affliction
which
is
but
for
a
moment
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
glory
while
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
seen
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
seen
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal
for
we
know
that
if
our
earthly
house
of
this
tabernacle
were
dissolved
we
have
a
building
of
god
an
house
not
made
with
hands
eternal
in
the
heavens
for
in
this
we
groan
earnestly
desiring
to
be
clothed
upon
with
our
house
which
is
from
heaven
if
so
be
that
being
clothed
we
shall
not
be
found
naked
for
we
that
are
in
this
tabernacle
do
groan
being
burdened
not
for
that
we
would
be
unclothed
but
clothed
upon
that
mortality
might
be
swallowed
up
of
life
now
he
that
hath
wrought
us
for
the
selfsame
thing
is
god
who
also
hath
given
unto
us
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
therefore
we
are
always
confident
knowing
that
whilst
we
are
at
home
in
the
body
we
are
absent
from
the
lord
for
we
walk
by
faith
not
by
sight
we
are
confident
i
say
and
willing
rather
to
be
absent
from
the
body
and
to
be
present
with
the
lord
wherefore
we
labour
that
whether
present
or
absent
we
may
be
accepted
of
him
for
we
must
all
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
that
every
one
may
receive
the
things
done
in
his
body
according
to
that
he
hath
done
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
knowing
therefore
the
terror
of
the
lord
we
persuade
men
but
we
are
made
manifest
unto
god
and
i
trust
also
are
made
manifest
in
your
consciences
for
we
commend
not
ourselves
again
unto
you
but
give
you
occasion
to
glory
on
our
behalf
that
ye
may
have
somewhat
to
answer
them
which
glory
in
appearance
and
not
in
heart
for
whether
we
be
beside
ourselves
it
is
to
god
or
whether
we
be
sober
it
is
for
your
cause
for
the
love
of
christ
constraineth
us
because
we
thus
judge
that
if
one
died
for
all
then
were
all
dead
and
that
he
died
for
all
that
they
which
live
should
not
henceforth
live
unto
themselves
but
unto
him
which
died
for
them
and
rose
again
wherefore
henceforth
know
we
no
man
after
the
flesh
yea
though
we
have
known
christ
after
the
flesh
yet
now
henceforth
know
we
him
no
more
therefore
if
any
man
be
in
christ
he
is
a
new
creature
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
all
things
are
become
new
and
all
things
are
of
god
who
hath
reconciled
us
to
himself
by
jesus
christ
and
hath
given
to
us
the
ministry
of
reconciliation
to
wit
that
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
them
and
hath
committed
unto
us
the
word
of
reconciliation
now
then
we
are
ambassadors
for
christ
as
though
god
did
beseech
you
by
us
we
pray
you
in
christ's
stead
be
ye
reconciled
to
god
for
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
him
we
then
as
workers
together
with
him
beseech
you
also
that
ye
receive
not
the
grace
of
god
in
vain
for
he
saith
i
have
heard
thee
in
a
time
accepted
and
in
the
day
of
salvation
have
i
succoured
thee
behold
now
is
the
accepted
time
behold
now
is
the
day
of
salvation
giving
no
offence
in
any
thing
that
the
ministry
be
not
blamed
but
in
all
things
approving
ourselves
as
the
ministers
of
god
in
much
patience
in
afflictions
in
necessities
in
distresses
in
stripes
in
imprisonments
in
tumults
in
labours
in
watchings
in
fastings
by
pureness
by
knowledge
by
longsuffering
by
kindness
by
the
holy
ghost
by
love
unfeigned
by
the
word
of
truth
by
the
power
of
god
by
the
armour
of
righteousness
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
by
honour
and
dishonour
by
evil
report
and
good
report
as
deceivers
and
yet
true
as
unknown
and
yet
well
known
as
dying
and
behold
we
live
as
chastened
and
not
killed
as
sorrowful
yet
alway
rejoicing
as
poor
yet
making
many
rich
as
having
nothing
and
yet
possessing
all
things
o
ye
corinthians
our
mouth
is
open
unto
you
our
heart
is
enlarged
ye
are
not
straitened
in
us
but
ye
are
straitened
in
your
own
bowels
now
for
a
recompence
in
the
same
i
speak
as
unto
my
children
be
ye
also
enlarged
be
ye
not
unequally
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
hath
righteousness
with
unrighteousness
and
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
or
what
part
hath
he
that
believeth
with
an
infidel
and
what
agreement
hath
the
temple
of
god
with
idols
for
ye
are
the
temple
of
the
living
god
as
god
hath
said
i
will
dwell
in
them
and
walk
in
them
and
i
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
wherefore
come
out
from
among
them
and
be
ye
separate
saith
the
lord
and
touch
not
the
unclean
thing
and
i
will
receive
you
and
will
be
a
father
unto
you
and
ye
shall
be
my
sons
and
daughters
saith
the
lord
almighty
having
therefore
these
promises
dearly
beloved
let
us
cleanse
ourselves
from
all
filthiness
of
the
flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
the
fear
of
god
receive
us
we
have
wronged
no
man
we
have
corrupted
no
man
we
have
defrauded
no
man
i
speak
not
this
to
condemn
you
for
i
have
said
before
that
ye
are
in
our
hearts
to
die
and
live
with
you
great
is
my
boldness
of
speech
toward
you
great
is
my
glorying
of
you
i
am
filled
with
comfort
i
am
exceeding
joyful
in
all
our
tribulation
for
when
we
were
come
into
macedonia
our
flesh
had
no
rest
but
we
were
troubled
on
every
side
without
were
fightings
within
were
fears
nevertheless
god
that
comforteth
those
that
are
cast
down
comforted
us
by
the
coming
of
titus
and
not
by
his
coming
only
but
by
the
consolation
wherewith
he
was
comforted
in
you
when
he
told
us
your
earnest
desire
your
mourning
your
fervent
mind
toward
me
so
that
i
rejoiced
the
more
for
though
i
made
you
sorry
with
a
letter
i
do
not
repent
though
i
did
repent
for
i
perceive
that
the
same
epistle
hath
made
you
sorry
though
it
were
but
for
a
season
now
i
rejoice
not
that
ye
were
made
sorry
but
that
ye
sorrowed
to
repentance
for
ye
were
made
sorry
after
a
godly
manner
that
ye
might
receive
damage
by
us
in
nothing
for
godly
sorrow
worketh
repentance
to
salvation
not
to
be
repented
of
but
the
sorrow
of
the
world
worketh
death
for
behold
this
selfsame
thing
that
ye
sorrowed
after
a
godly
sort
what
carefulness
it
wrought
in
you
yea
what
clearing
of
yourselves
yea
what
indignation
yea
what
fear
yea
what
vehement
desire
yea
what
zeal
yea
what
revenge
in
all
things
ye
have
approved
yourselves
to
be
clear
in
this
matter
wherefore
though
i
wrote
unto
you
i
did
it
not
for
his
cause
that
had
done
the
wrong
nor
for
his
cause
that
suffered
wrong
but
that
our
care
for
you
in
the
sight
of
god
might
appear
unto
you
therefore
we
were
comforted
in
your
comfort
yea
and
exceedingly
the
more
joyed
we
for
the
joy
of
titus
because
his
spirit
was
refreshed
by
you
all
for
if
i
have
boasted
any
thing
to
him
of
you
i
am
not
ashamed
but
as
we
spake
all
things
to
you
in
truth
even
so
our
boasting
which
i
made
before
titus
is
found
a
truth
and
his
inward
affection
is
more
abundant
toward
you
whilst
he
remembereth
the
obedience
of
you
all
how
with
fear
and
trembling
ye
received
him
i
rejoice
therefore
that
i
have
confidence
in
you
in
all
things
moreover
brethren
we
do
you
to
wit
of
the
grace
of
god
bestowed
on
the
churches
of
macedonia
how
that
in
a
great
trial
of
affliction
the
abundance
of
their
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
abounded
unto
the
riches
of
their
liberality
for
to
their
power
i
bear
record
yea
and
beyond
their
power
they
were
willing
of
themselves
praying
us
with
much
intreaty
that
we
would
receive
the
gift
and
take
upon
us
the
fellowship
of
the
ministering
to
the
saints
and
this
they
did
not
as
we
hoped
but
first
gave
their
own
selves
to
the
lord
and
unto
us
by
the
will
of
god
insomuch
that
we
desired
titus
that
as
he
had
begun
so
he
would
also
finish
in
you
the
same
grace
also
therefore
as
ye
abound
in
every
thing
in
faith
and
utterance
and
knowledge
and
in
all
diligence
and
in
your
love
to
us
see
that
ye
abound
in
this
grace
also
i
speak
not
by
commandment
but
by
occasion
of
the
forwardness
of
others
and
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
your
love
for
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
poor
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
and
herein
i
give
my
advice
for
this
is
expedient
for
you
who
have
begun
before
not
only
to
do
but
also
to
be
forward
a
year
ago
now
therefore
perform
the
doing
of
it
that
as
there
was
a
readiness
to
will
so
there
may
be
a
performance
also
out
of
that
which
ye
have
for
if
there
be
first
a
willing
mind
it
is
accepted
according
to
that
a
man
hath
and
not
according
to
that
he
hath
not
for
i
mean
not
that
other
men
be
eased
and
ye
burdened
but
by
an
equality
that
now
at
this
time
your
abundance
may
be
a
supply
for
their
want
that
their
abundance
also
may
be
a
supply
for
your
want
that
there
may
be
equality
as
it
is
written
he
that
had
gathered
much
had
nothing
over
and
he
that
had
gathered
little
had
no
lack
but
thanks
be
to
god
which
put
the
same
earnest
care
into
the
heart
of
titus
for
you
for
indeed
he
accepted
the
exhortation
but
being
more
forward
of
his
own
accord
he
went
unto
you
and
we
have
sent
with
him
the
brother
whose
praise
is
in
the
gospel
throughout
all
the
churches
and
not
that
only
but
who
was
also
chosen
of
the
churches
to
travel
with
us
with
this
grace
which
is
administered
by
us
to
the
glory
of
the
same
lord
and
declaration
of
your
ready
mind
avoiding
this
that
no
man
should
blame
us
in
this
abundance
which
is
administered
by
us
providing
for
honest
things
not
only
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
also
in
the
sight
of
men
and
we
have
sent
with
them
our
brother
whom
we
have
oftentimes
proved
diligent
in
many
things
but
now
much
more
diligent
upon
the
great
confidence
which
i
have
in
you
whether
any
do
enquire
of
titus
he
is
my
partner
and
fellowhelper
concerning
you
or
our
brethren
be
enquired
of
they
are
the
messengers
of
the
churches
and
the
glory
of
christ
wherefore
shew
ye
to
them
and
before
the
churches
the
proof
of
your
love
and
of
our
boasting
on
your
behalf
for
as
touching
the
ministering
to
the
saints
it
is
superfluous
for
me
to
write
to
you
for
i
know
the
forwardness
of
your
mind
for
which
i
boast
of
you
to
them
of
macedonia
that
achaia
was
ready
a
year
ago
and
your
zeal
hath
provoked
very
many
yet
have
i
sent
the
brethren
lest
our
boasting
of
you
should
be
in
vain
in
this
behalf
that
as
i
said
ye
may
be
ready
lest
haply
if
they
of
macedonia
come
with
me
and
find
you
unprepared
we
that
we
say
not
ye
should
be
ashamed
in
this
same
confident
boasting
therefore
i
thought
it
necessary
to
exhort
the
brethren
that
they
would
go
before
unto
you
and
make
up
beforehand
your
bounty
whereof
ye
had
notice
before
that
the
same
might
be
ready
as
a
matter
of
bounty
and
not
as
of
covetousness
but
this
i
say
he
which
soweth
sparingly
shall
reap
also
sparingly
and
he
which
soweth
bountifully
shall
reap
also
bountifully
every
man
according
as
he
purposeth
in
his
heart
so
let
him
give
not
grudgingly
or
of
necessity
for
god
loveth
a
cheerful
giver
and
god
is
able
to
make
all
grace
abound
toward
you
that
ye
always
having
all
sufficiency
in
all
things
may
abound
to
every
good
work
as
it
is
written
he
hath
dispersed
abroad
he
hath
given
to
the
poor
his
righteousness
remaineth
for
ever
now
he
that
ministereth
seed
to
the
sower
both
minister
bread
for
your
food
and
multiply
your
seed
sown
and
increase
the
fruits
of
your
righteousness
being
enriched
in
every
thing
to
all
bountifulness
which
causeth
through
us
thanksgiving
to
god
for
the
administration
of
this
service
not
only
supplieth
the
want
of
the
saints
but
is
abundant
also
by
many
thanksgivings
unto
god
whiles
by
the
experiment
of
this
ministration
they
glorify
god
for
your
professed
subjection
unto
the
gospel
of
christ
and
for
your
liberal
distribution
unto
them
and
unto
all
men
and
by
their
prayer
for
you
which
long
after
you
for
the
exceeding
grace
of
god
in
you
thanks
be
unto
god
for
his
unspeakable
gift
now
i
paul
myself
beseech
you
by
the
meekness
and
gentleness
of
christ
who
in
presence
am
base
among
you
but
being
absent
am
bold
toward
you
but
i
beseech
you
that
i
may
not
be
bold
when
i
am
present
with
that
confidence
wherewith
i
think
to
be
bold
against
some
which
think
of
us
as
if
we
walked
according
to
the
flesh
for
though
we
walk
in
the
flesh
we
do
not
war
after
the
flesh
for
the
weapons
of
our
warfare
are
not
carnal
but
mighty
through
god
to
the
pulling
down
of
strong
holds
casting
down
imaginations
and
every
high
thing
that
exalteth
itself
against
the
knowledge
of
god
and
bringing
into
captivity
every
thought
to
the
obedience
of
christ
and
having
in
a
readiness
to
revenge
all
disobedience
when
your
obedience
is
fulfilled
do
ye
look
on
things
after
the
outward
appearance
if
any
man
trust
to
himself
that
he
is
christ's
let
him
of
himself
think
this
again
that
as
he
is
christ's
even
so
are
we
christ's
for
though
i
should
boast
somewhat
more
of
our
authority
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
for
edification
and
not
for
your
destruction
i
should
not
be
ashamed
that
i
may
not
seem
as
if
i
would
terrify
you
by
letters
for
his
letters
say
they
are
weighty
and
powerful
but
his
bodily
presence
is
weak
and
his
speech
contemptible
let
such
an
one
think
this
that
such
as
we
are
in
word
by
letters
when
we
are
absent
such
will
we
be
also
in
deed
when
we
are
present
for
we
dare
not
make
ourselves
of
the
number
or
compare
ourselves
with
some
that
commend
themselves
but
they
measuring
themselves
by
themselves
and
comparing
themselves
among
themselves
are
not
wise
but
we
will
not
boast
of
things
without
our
measure
but
according
to
the
measure
of
the
rule
which
god
hath
distributed
to
us
a
measure
to
reach
even
unto
you
for
we
stretch
not
ourselves
beyond
our
measure
as
though
we
reached
not
unto
you
for
we
are
come
as
far
as
to
you
also
in
preaching
the
gospel
of
christ
not
boasting
of
things
without
our
measure
that
is
of
other
men's
labours
but
having
hope
when
your
faith
is
increased
that
we
shall
be
enlarged
by
you
according
to
our
rule
abundantly
to
preach
the
gospel
in
the
regions
beyond
you
and
not
to
boast
in
another
man's
line
of
things
made
ready
to
our
hand
but
he
that
glorieth
let
him
glory
in
the
lord
for
not
he
that
commendeth
himself
is
approved
but
whom
the
lord
commendeth
would
to
god
ye
could
bear
with
me
a
little
in
my
folly
and
indeed
bear
with
me
for
i
am
jealous
over
you
with
godly
jealousy
for
i
have
espoused
you
to
one
husband
that
i
may
present
you
as
a
chaste
virgin
to
christ
but
i
fear
lest
by
any
means
as
the
serpent
beguiled
eve
through
his
subtilty
so
your
minds
should
be
corrupted
from
the
simplicity
that
is
in
christ
for
if
he
that
cometh
preacheth
another
jesus
whom
we
have
not
preached
or
if
ye
receive
another
spirit
which
ye
have
not
received
or
another
gospel
which
ye
have
not
accepted
ye
might
well
bear
with
him
for
i
suppose
i
was
not
a
whit
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
but
though
i
be
rude
in
speech
yet
not
in
knowledge
but
we
have
been
throughly
made
manifest
among
you
in
all
things
have
i
committed
an
offence
in
abasing
myself
that
ye
might
be
exalted
because
i
have
preached
to
you
the
gospel
of
god
freely
i
robbed
other
churches
taking
wages
of
them
to
do
you
service
and
when
i
was
present
with
you
and
wanted
i
was
chargeable
to
no
man
for
that
which
was
lacking
to
me
the
brethren
which
came
from
macedonia
supplied
and
in
all
things
i
have
kept
myself
from
being
burdensome
unto
you
and
so
will
i
keep
myself
as
the
truth
of
christ
is
in
me
no
man
shall
stop
me
of
this
boasting
in
the
regions
of
achaia
wherefore
because
i
love
you
not
god
knoweth
but
what
i
do
that
i
will
do
that
i
may
cut
off
occasion
from
them
which
desire
occasion
that
wherein
they
glory
they
may
be
found
even
as
we
for
such
are
false
apostles
deceitful
workers
transforming
themselves
into
the
apostles
of
christ
and
no
marvel
for
satan
himself
is
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
therefore
it
is
no
great
thing
if
his
ministers
also
be
transformed
as
the
ministers
of
righteousness
whose
end
shall
be
according
to
their
works
i
say
again
let
no
man
think
me
a
fool
if
otherwise
yet
as
a
fool
receive
me
that
i
may
boast
myself
a
little
that
which
i
speak
i
speak
it
not
after
the
lord
but
as
it
were
foolishly
in
this
confidence
of
boasting
seeing
that
many
glory
after
the
flesh
i
will
glory
also
for
ye
suffer
fools
gladly
seeing
ye
yourselves
are
wise
for
ye
suffer
if
a
man
bring
you
into
bondage
if
a
man
devour
you
if
a
man
take
of
you
if
a
man
exalt
himself
if
a
man
smite
you
on
the
face
i
speak
as
concerning
reproach
as
though
we
had
been
weak
howbeit
whereinsoever
any
is
bold
i
speak
foolishly
i
am
bold
also
are
they
hebrews
so
am
i
are
they
israelites
so
am
i
are
they
the
seed
of
abraham
so
am
i
are
they
ministers
of
christ
i
speak
as
a
fool
i
am
more
in
labours
more
abundant
in
stripes
above
measure
in
prisons
more
frequent
in
deaths
oft
of
the
jews
five
times
received
i
forty
stripes
save
one
thrice
was
i
beaten
with
rods
once
was
i
stoned
thrice
i
suffered
shipwreck
a
night
and
a
day
i
have
been
in
the
deep
in
journeyings
often
in
perils
of
waters
in
perils
of
robbers
in
perils
by
mine
own
countrymen
in
perils
by
the
heathen
in
perils
in
the
city
in
perils
in
the
wilderness
in
perils
in
the
sea
in
perils
among
false
brethren
in
weariness
and
painfulness
in
watchings
often
in
hunger
and
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
beside
those
things
that
are
without
that
which
cometh
upon
me
daily
the
care
of
all
the
churches
who
is
weak
and
i
am
not
weak
who
is
offended
and
i
burn
not
if
i
must
needs
glory
i
will
glory
of
the
things
which
concern
mine
infirmities
the
god
and
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
which
is
blessed
for
evermore
knoweth
that
i
lie
not
in
damascus
the
governor
under
aretas
the
king
kept
the
city
of
the
damascenes
with
a
garrison
desirous
to
apprehend
me
and
through
a
window
in
a
basket
was
i
let
down
by
the
wall
and
escaped
his
hands
it
is
not
expedient
for
me
doubtless
to
glory
i
will
come
to
visions
and
revelations
of
the
lord
i
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
ago
whether
in
the
body
i
cannot
tell
or
whether
out
of
the
body
i
cannot
tell
god
knoweth
such
an
one
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
and
i
knew
such
a
man
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
i
cannot
tell
god
knoweth
how
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter
of
such
an
one
will
i
glory
yet
of
myself
i
will
not
glory
but
in
mine
infirmities
for
though
i
would
desire
to
glory
i
shall
not
be
a
fool
for
i
will
say
the
truth
but
now
i
forbear
lest
any
man
should
think
of
me
above
that
which
he
seeth
me
to
be
or
that
he
heareth
of
me
and
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
measure
through
the
abundance
of
the
revelations
there
was
given
to
me
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
the
messenger
of
satan
to
buffet
me
lest
i
should
be
exalted
above
measure
for
this
thing
i
besought
the
lord
thrice
that
it
might
depart
from
me
and
he
said
unto
me
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
for
my
strength
is
made
perfect
in
weakness
most
gladly
therefore
will
i
rather
glory
in
my
infirmities
that
the
power
of
christ
may
rest
upon
me
therefore
i
take
pleasure
in
infirmities
in
reproaches
in
necessities
in
persecutions
in
distresses
for
christ's
sake
for
when
i
am
weak
then
am
i
strong
i
am
become
a
fool
in
glorying
ye
have
compelled
me
for
i
ought
to
have
been
commended
of
you
for
in
nothing
am
i
behind
the
very
chiefest
apostles
though
i
be
nothing
truly
the
signs
of
an
apostle
were
wrought
among
you
in
all
patience
in
signs
and
wonders
and
mighty
deeds
for
what
is
it
wherein
ye
were
inferior
to
other
churches
except
it
be
that
i
myself
was
not
burdensome
to
you
forgive
me
this
wrong
behold
the
third
time
i
am
ready
to
come
to
you
and
i
will
not
be
burdensome
to
you
for
i
seek
not
your's
but
you
for
the
children
ought
not
to
lay
up
for
the
parents
but
the
parents
for
the
children
and
i
will
very
gladly
spend
and
be
spent
for
you
though
the
more
abundantly
i
love
you
the
less
i
be
loved
but
be
it
so
i
did
not
burden
you
nevertheless
being
crafty
i
caught
you
with
guile
did
i
make
a
gain
of
you
by
any
of
them
whom
i
sent
unto
you
i
desired
titus
and
with
him
i
sent
a
brother
did
titus
make
a
gain
of
you
walked
we
not
in
the
same
spirit
walked
we
not
in
the
same
steps
again
think
ye
that
we
excuse
ourselves
unto
you
we
speak
before
god
in
christ
but
we
do
all
things
dearly
beloved
for
your
edifying
for
i
fear
lest
when
i
come
i
shall
not
find
you
such
as
i
would
and
that
i
shall
be
found
unto
you
such
as
ye
would
not
lest
there
be
debates
envyings
wraths
strifes
backbitings
whisperings
swellings
tumults
and
lest
when
i
come
again
my
god
will
humble
me
among
you
and
that
i
shall
bewail
many
which
have
sinned
already
and
have
not
repented
of
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
lasciviousness
which
they
have
committed
this
is
the
third
time
i
am
coming
to
you
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
shall
every
word
be
established
i
told
you
before
and
foretell
you
as
if
i
were
present
the
second
time
and
being
absent
now
i
write
to
them
which
heretofore
have
sinned
and
to
all
other
that
if
i
come
again
i
will
not
spare
since
ye
seek
a
proof
of
christ
speaking
in
me
which
to
you-ward
is
not
weak
but
is
mighty
in
you
for
though
he
was
crucified
through
weakness
yet
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
god
for
we
also
are
weak
in
him
but
we
shall
live
with
him
by
the
power
of
god
toward
you
examine
yourselves
whether
ye
be
in
the
faith
prove
your
own
selves
know
ye
not
your
own
selves
how
that
jesus
christ
is
in
you
except
ye
be
reprobates
but
i
trust
that
ye
shall
know
that
we
are
not
reprobates
now
i
pray
to
god
that
ye
do
no
evil
not
that
we
should
appear
approved
but
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
honest
though
we
be
as
reprobates
for
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
for
we
are
glad
when
we
are
weak
and
ye
are
strong
and
this
also
we
wish
even
your
perfection
therefore
i
write
these
things
being
absent
lest
being
present
i
should
use
sharpness
according
to
the
power
which
the
lord
hath
given
me
to
edification
and
not
to
destruction
finally
brethren
farewell
be
perfect
be
of
good
comfort
be
of
one
mind
live
in
peace
and
the
god
of
love
and
peace
shall
be
with
you
greet
one
another
with
an
holy
kiss
all
the
saints
salute
you
the
grace
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
love
of
god
and
the
communion
of
the
holy
ghost
be
with
you
all
amen
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
galatians
paul
an
apostle
not
of
men
neither
by
man
but
by
jesus
christ
and
god
the
father
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
all
the
brethren
which
are
with
me
unto
the
churches
of
galatia
grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
from
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
gave
himself
for
our
sins
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
this
present
evil
world
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
our
father
to
whom
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
i
marvel
that
ye
are
so
soon
removed
from
him
that
called
you
into
the
grace
of
christ
unto
another
gospel
which
is
not
another
but
there
be
some
that
trouble
you
and
would
pervert
the
gospel
of
christ
but
though
we
or
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
which
we
have
preached
unto
you
let
him
be
accursed
as
we
said
before
so
say
i
now
again
if
any
man
preach
any
other
gospel
unto
you
than
that
ye
have
received
let
him
be
accursed
for
do
i
now
persuade
men
or
god
or
do
i
seek
to
please
men
for
if
i
yet
pleased
men
i
should
not
be
the
servant
of
christ
but
i
certify
you
brethren
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
of
me
is
not
after
man
for
i
neither
received
it
of
man
neither
was
i
taught
it
but
by
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
for
ye
have
heard
of
my
conversation
in
time
past
in
the
jews
religion
how
that
beyond
measure
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
and
wasted
it
and
profited
in
the
jews
religion
above
many
my
equals
in
mine
own
nation
being
more
exceedingly
zealous
of
the
traditions
of
my
fathers
but
when
it
pleased
god
who
separated
me
from
my
mother's
womb
and
called
me
by
his
grace
to
reveal
his
son
in
me
that
i
might
preach
him
among
the
heathen
immediately
i
conferred
not
with
flesh
and
blood
neither
went
i
up
to
jerusalem
to
them
which
were
apostles
before
me
but
i
went
into
arabia
and
returned
again
unto
damascus
then
after
three
years
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
to
see
peter
and
abode
with
him
fifteen
days
but
other
of
the
apostles
saw
i
none
save
james
the
lord's
brother
now
the
things
which
i
write
unto
you
behold
before
god
i
lie
not
afterwards
i
came
into
the
regions
of
syria
and
cilicia
and
was
unknown
by
face
unto
the
churches
of
judaea
which
were
in
christ
but
they
had
heard
only
that
he
which
persecuted
us
in
times
past
now
preacheth
the
faith
which
once
he
destroyed
and
they
glorified
god
in
me
then
fourteen
years
after
i
went
up
again
to
jerusalem
with
barnabas
and
took
titus
with
me
also
and
i
went
up
by
revelation
and
communicated
unto
them
that
gospel
which
i
preach
among
the
gentiles
but
privately
to
them
which
were
of
reputation
lest
by
any
means
i
should
run
or
had
run
in
vain
but
neither
titus
who
was
with
me
being
a
greek
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised
and
that
because
of
false
brethren
unawares
brought
in
who
came
in
privily
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
christ
jesus
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage
to
whom
we
gave
place
by
subjection
no
not
for
an
hour
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you
but
of
these
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
whatsoever
they
were
it
maketh
no
matter
to
me
god
accepteth
no
man's
person
for
they
who
seemed
to
be
somewhat
in
conference
added
nothing
to
me
but
contrariwise
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
of
the
uncircumcision
was
committed
unto
me
as
the
gospel
of
the
circumcision
was
unto
peter
for
he
that
wrought
effectually
in
peter
to
the
apostleship
of
the
circumcision
the
same
was
mighty
in
me
toward
the
gentiles
and
when
james
cephas
and
john
who
seemed
to
be
pillars
perceived
the
grace
that
was
given
unto
me
they
gave
to
me
and
barnabas
the
right
hands
of
fellowship
that
we
should
go
unto
the
heathen
and
they
unto
the
circumcision
only
they
would
that
we
should
remember
the
poor
the
same
which
i
also
was
forward
to
do
but
when
peter
was
come
to
antioch
i
withstood
him
to
the
face
because
he
was
to
be
blamed
for
before
that
certain
came
from
james
he
did
eat
with
the
gentiles
but
when
they
were
come
he
withdrew
and
separated
himself
fearing
them
which
were
of
the
circumcision
and
the
other
jews
dissembled
likewise
with
him
insomuch
that
barnabas
also
was
carried
away
with
their
dissimulation
but
when
i
saw
that
they
walked
not
uprightly
according
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel
i
said
unto
peter
before
them
all
if
thou
being
a
jew
livest
after
the
manner
of
gentiles
and
not
as
do
the
jews
why
compellest
thou
the
gentiles
to
live
as
do
the
jews
we
who
are
jews
by
nature
and
not
sinners
of
the
gentiles
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
by
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
even
we
have
believed
in
jesus
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
but
if
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
christ
we
ourselves
also
are
found
sinners
is
therefore
christ
the
minister
of
sin
god
forbid
for
if
i
build
again
the
things
which
i
destroyed
i
make
myself
a
transgressor
for
i
through
the
law
am
dead
to
the
law
that
i
might
live
unto
god
i
am
crucified
with
christ
neverthless
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
and
the
life
which
i
now
live
in
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
i
do
not
frustrate
the
grace
of
god
for
if
righteousness
come
by
the
law
then
christ
is
dead
in
vain
o
foolish
galatians
who
hath
bewitched
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
before
whose
eyes
jesus
christ
hath
been
evidently
set
forth
crucified
among
you
this
only
would
i
learn
of
you
received
ye
the
spirit
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
are
ye
so
foolish
having
begun
in
the
spirit
are
ye
now
made
perfect
by
the
flesh
have
ye
suffered
so
many
things
in
vain
if
it
be
yet
in
vain
he
therefore
that
ministereth
to
you
the
spirit
and
worketh
miracles
among
you
doeth
he
it
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
even
as
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
righteousness
know
ye
therefore
that
they
which
are
of
faith
the
same
are
the
children
of
abraham
and
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
so
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
abraham
for
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
but
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
evident
for
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
and
the
law
is
not
of
faith
but
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
being
made
a
curse
for
us
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
tree
that
the
blessing
of
abraham
might
come
on
the
gentiles
through
jesus
christ
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
spirit
through
faith
brethren
i
speak
after
the
manner
of
men
though
it
be
but
a
man's
covenant
yet
if
it
be
confirmed
no
man
disannulleth
or
addeth
thereto
now
to
abraham
and
his
seed
were
the
promises
made
he
saith
not
and
to
seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
one
and
to
thy
seed
which
is
christ
and
this
i
say
that
the
covenant
that
was
confirmed
before
of
god
in
christ
the
law
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
cannot
disannul
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
none
effect
for
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
law
it
is
no
more
of
promise
but
god
gave
it
to
abraham
by
promise
wherefore
then
serveth
the
law
it
was
added
because
of
transgressions
till
the
seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
and
it
was
ordained
by
angels
in
the
hand
of
a
mediator
now
a
mediator
is
not
a
mediator
of
one
but
god
is
one
is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
god
god
forbid
for
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
law
but
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
believe
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
the
law
shut
up
unto
the
faith
which
should
afterwards
be
revealed
wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
but
after
that
faith
is
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
schoolmaster
for
ye
are
all
the
children
of
god
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
for
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
into
christ
have
put
on
christ
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
there
is
neither
bond
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
for
ye
are
all
one
in
christ
jesus
and
if
ye
be
christ's
then
are
ye
abraham's
seed
and
heirs
according
to
the
promise
now
i
say
that
the
heir
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
differeth
nothing
from
a
servant
though
he
be
lord
of
all
but
is
under
tutors
and
governors
until
the
time
appointed
of
the
father
even
so
we
when
we
were
children
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
world
but
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
sons
and
because
ye
are
sons
god
hath
sent
forth
the
spirit
of
his
son
into
your
hearts
crying
abba
father
wherefore
thou
art
no
more
a
servant
but
a
son
and
if
a
son
then
an
heir
of
god
through
christ
howbeit
then
when
ye
knew
not
god
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
are
no
gods
but
now
after
that
ye
have
known
god
or
rather
are
known
of
god
how
turn
ye
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
whereunto
ye
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage
ye
observe
days
and
months
and
times
and
years
i
am
afraid
of
you
lest
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
labour
in
vain
brethren
i
beseech
you
be
as
i
am
for
i
am
as
ye
are
ye
have
not
injured
me
at
all
ye
know
how
through
infirmity
of
the
flesh
i
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
at
the
first
and
my
temptation
which
was
in
my
flesh
ye
despised
not
nor
rejected
but
received
me
as
an
angel
of
god
even
as
christ
jesus
where
is
then
the
blessedness
ye
spake
of
for
i
bear
you
record
that
if
it
had
been
possible
ye
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
eyes
and
have
given
them
to
me
am
i
therefore
become
your
enemy
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
they
zealously
affect
you
but
not
well
yea
they
would
exclude
you
that
ye
might
affect
them
but
it
is
good
to
be
zealously
affected
always
in
a
good
thing
and
not
only
when
i
am
present
with
you
my
little
children
of
whom
i
travail
in
birth
again
until
christ
be
formed
in
you
i
desire
to
be
present
with
you
now
and
to
change
my
voice
for
i
stand
in
doubt
of
you
tell
me
ye
that
desire
to
be
under
the
law
do
ye
not
hear
the
law
for
it
is
written
that
abraham
had
two
sons
the
one
by
a
bondmaid
the
other
by
a
freewoman
but
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
after
the
flesh
but
he
of
the
freewoman
was
by
promise
which
things
are
an
allegory
for
these
are
the
two
covenants
the
one
from
the
mount
sinai
which
gendereth
to
bondage
which
is
agar
for
this
agar
is
mount
sinai
in
arabia
and
answereth
to
jerusalem
which
now
is
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
children
but
jerusalem
which
is
above
is
free
which
is
the
mother
of
us
all
for
it
is
written
rejoice
thou
barren
that
bearest
not
break
forth
and
cry
thou
that
travailest
not
for
the
desolate
hath
many
more
children
than
she
which
hath
an
husband
now
we
brethren
as
isaac
was
are
the
children
of
promise
but
as
then
he
that
was
born
after
the
flesh
persecuted
him
that
was
born
after
the
spirit
even
so
it
is
now
nevertheless
what
saith
the
scripture
cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
freewoman
so
then
brethren
we
are
not
children
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
free
stand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
wherewith
christ
hath
made
us
free
and
be
not
entangled
again
with
the
yoke
of
bondage
behold
i
paul
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
be
circumcised
christ
shall
profit
you
nothing
for
i
testify
again
to
every
man
that
is
circumcised
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
do
the
whole
law
christ
is
become
of
no
effect
unto
you
whosoever
of
you
are
justified
by
the
law
ye
are
fallen
from
grace
for
we
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
faith
for
in
jesus
christ
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
thing
nor
uncircumcision
but
faith
which
worketh
by
love
ye
did
run
well
who
did
hinder
you
that
ye
should
not
obey
the
truth
this
persuasion
cometh
not
of
him
that
calleth
you
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
i
have
confidence
in
you
through
the
lord
that
ye
will
be
none
otherwise
minded
but
he
that
troubleth
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whosoever
he
be
and
i
brethren
if
i
yet
preach
circumcision
why
do
i
yet
suffer
persecution
then
is
the
offence
of
the
cross
ceased
i
would
they
were
even
cut
off
which
trouble
you
for
brethren
ye
have
been
called
unto
liberty
only
use
not
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
but
by
love
serve
one
another
for
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
even
in
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
but
if
ye
bite
and
devour
one
another
take
heed
that
ye
be
not
consumed
one
of
another
this
i
say
then
walk
in
the
spirit
and
ye
shall
not
fulfil
the
lust
of
the
flesh
for
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
and
these
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
so
that
ye
cannot
do
the
things
that
ye
would
but
if
ye
be
led
of
the
spirit
ye
are
not
under
the
law
now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
manifest
which
are
these
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lasciviousness
idolatry
witchcraft
hatred
variance
emulations
wrath
strife
seditions
heresies
envyings
murders
drunkenness
revellings
and
such
like
of
the
which
i
tell
you
before
as
i
have
also
told
you
in
time
past
that
they
which
do
such
things
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
but
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
gentleness
goodness
faith
meekness
temperance
against
such
there
is
no
law
and
they
that
are
christ's
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
the
affections
and
lusts
if
we
live
in
the
spirit
let
us
also
walk
in
the
spirit
let
us
not
be
desirous
of
vain
glory
provoking
one
another
envying
one
another
brethren
if
a
man
be
overtaken
in
a
fault
ye
which
are
spiritual
restore
such
an
one
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
considering
thyself
lest
thou
also
be
tempted
bear
ye
one
another's
burdens
and
so
fulfil
the
law
of
christ
for
if
a
man
think
himself
to
be
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
deceiveth
himself
but
let
every
man
prove
his
own
work
and
then
shall
he
have
rejoicing
in
himself
alone
and
not
in
another
for
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
burden
let
him
that
is
taught
in
the
word
communicate
unto
him
that
teacheth
in
all
good
things
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
for
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
for
he
that
soweth
to
his
flesh
shall
of
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
he
that
soweth
to
the
spirit
shall
of
the
spirit
reap
life
everlasting
and
let
us
not
be
weary
in
well
doing
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
ye
see
how
large
a
letter
i
have
written
unto
you
with
mine
own
hand
as
many
as
desire
to
make
a
fair
shew
in
the
flesh
they
constrain
you
to
be
circumcised
only
lest
they
should
suffer
persecution
for
the
cross
of
christ
for
neither
they
themselves
who
are
circumcised
keep
the
law
but
desire
to
have
you
circumcised
that
they
may
glory
in
your
flesh
but
god
forbid
that
i
should
glory
save
in
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
the
world
is
crucified
unto
me
and
i
unto
the
world
for
in
christ
jesus
neither
circumcision
availeth
any
thing
nor
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creature
and
as
many
as
walk
according
to
this
rule
peace
be
on
them
and
mercy
and
upon
the
israel
of
god
from
henceforth
let
no
man
trouble
me
for
i
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
lord
jesus
brethren
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
your
spirit

in
heavenly
places
in
christ
according
as
he
hath
chosen
us
in
him
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
that
we
should
be
holy
and
without
blame
before
him
in
love
having
predestinated
us
unto
the
adoption
of
children
by
jesus
christ
to
himself
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
his
will
to
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
his
grace
wherein
he
hath
made
us
accepted
in
the
beloved
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
the
forgiveness
of
sins
according
to
the
riches
of
his
grace
wherein
he
hath
abounded
toward
us
in
all
wisdom
and
prudence
having
made
known
unto
us
the
mystery
of
his
will
according
to
his
good
pleasure
which
he
hath
purposed
in
himself
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
he
might
gather
together
in
one
all
things
in
christ
both
which
are
in
heaven
and
which
are
on
earth
even
in
him
in
whom
also
we
have
obtained
an
inheritance
being
predestinated
according
to
the
purpose
of
him
who
worketh
all
things
after
the
counsel
of
his
own
will
that
we
should
be
to
the
praise
of
his
glory
who
first
trusted
in
christ
in
whom
ye
also
trusted
after
that
ye
heard
the
word
of
truth
the
gospel
of
your
salvation
in
whom
also
after
that
ye
believed
ye
were
sealed
with
that
holy
spirit
of
promise
which
is
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of
the
purchased
possession
unto
the
praise
of
his
glory
wherefore
i
also
after
i
heard
of
your
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
and
love
unto
all
the
saints
cease
not
to
give
thanks
for
you
making
mention
of
you
in
my
prayers
that
the
god
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
father
of
glory
may
give
unto
you
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
revelation
in
the
knowledge
of
him
the
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
enlightened
that
ye
may
know
what
is
the
hope
of
his
calling
and
what
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
his
inheritance
in
the
saints
and
what
is
the
exceeding
greatness
of
his
power
to
us-ward
who
believe
according
to
the
working
of
his
mighty
power
which
he
wrought
in
christ
when
he
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
set
him
at
his
own
right
hand
in
the
heavenly
places
far
above
all
principality
and
power
and
might
and
dominion
and
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
world
but
also
in
that
which
is
to
come
and
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
and
gave
him
to
be
the
head
over
all
things
to
the
church
which
is
his
body
the
fulness
of
him
that
filleth
all
in
all
and
you
hath
he
quickened
who
were
dead
in
trespasses
and
sins
wherein
in
time
past
ye
walked
according
to
the
course
of
this
world
according
to
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
spirit
that
now
worketh
in
the
children
of
disobedience
among
whom
also
we
all
had
our
conversation
in
times
past
in
the
lusts
of
our
flesh
fulfilling
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
mind
and
were
by
nature
the
children
of
wrath
even
as
others
but
god
who
is
rich
in
mercy
for
his
great
love
wherewith
he
loved
us
even
when
we
were
dead
in
sins
hath
quickened
us
together
with
christ
by
grace
ye
are
saved
and
hath
raised
us
up
together
and
made
us
sit
together
in
heavenly
places
in
christ
jesus
that
in
the
ages
to
come
he
might
shew
the
exceeding
riches
of
his
grace
in
his
kindness
toward
us
through
christ
jesus
for
by
grace
are
ye
saved
through
faith
and
that
not
of
yourselves
it
is
the
gift
of
god
not
of
works
lest
any
man
should
boast
for
we
are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
them
wherefore
remember
that
ye
being
in
time
past
gentiles
in
the
flesh
who
are
called
uncircumcision
by
that
which
is
called
the
circumcision
in
the
flesh
made
by
hands
that
at
that
time
ye
were
without
christ
being
aliens
from
the
commonwealth
of
israel
and
strangers
from
the
covenants
of
promise
having
no
hope
and
without
god
in
the
world
but
now
in
christ
jesus
ye
who
sometimes
were
far
off
are
made
nigh
by
the
blood
of
christ
for
he
is
our
peace
who
hath
made
both
one
and
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
between
us
having
abolished
in
his
flesh
the
enmity
even
the
law
of
commandments
contained
in
ordinances
for
to
make
in
himself
of
twain
one
new
man
so
making
peace
and
that
he
might
reconcile
both
unto
god
in
one
body
by
the
cross
having
slain
the
enmity
thereby
and
came
and
preached
peace
to
you
which
were
afar
off
and
to
them
that
were
nigh
for
through
him
we
both
have
access
by
one
spirit
unto
the
father
now
therefore
ye
are
no
more
strangers
and
foreigners
but
fellowcitizens
with
the
saints
and
of
the
household
of
god
and
are
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
jesus
christ
himself
being
the
chief
corner
stone
in
whom
all
the
building
fitly
framed
together
groweth
unto
an
holy
temple
in
the
lord
in
whom
ye
also
are
builded
together
for
an
habitation
of
god
through
the
spirit
for
this
cause
i
paul
the
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
for
you
gentiles
if
ye
have
heard
of
the
dispensation
of
the
grace
of
god
which
is
given
me
to
you-ward
how
that
by
revelation
he
made
known
unto
me
the
mystery
as
i
wrote
afore
in
few
words
whereby
when
ye
read
ye
may
understand
my
knowledge
in
the
mystery
of
christ
which
in
other
ages
was
not
made
known
unto
the
sons
of
men
as
it
is
now
revealed
unto
his
holy
apostles
and
prophets
by
the
spirit
that
the
gentiles
should
be
fellowheirs
and
of
the
same
body
and
partakers
of
his
promise
in
christ
by
the
gospel
whereof
i
was
made
a
minister
according
to
the
gift
of
the
grace
of
god
given
unto
me
by
the
effectual
working
of
his
power
unto
me
who
am
less
than
the
least
of
all
saints
is
this
grace
given
that
i
should
preach
among
the
gentiles
the
unsearchable
riches
of
christ
and
to
make
all
men
see
what
is
the
fellowship
of
the
mystery
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
hath
been
hid
in
god
who
created
all
things
by
jesus
christ
to
the
intent
that
now
unto
the
principalities
and
powers
in
heavenly
places
might
be
known
by
the
church
the
manifold
wisdom
of
god
according
to
the
eternal
purpose
which
he
purposed
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
in
whom
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
by
the
faith
of
him
wherefore
i
desire
that
ye
faint
not
at
my
tribulations
for
you
which
is
your
glory
for
this
cause
i
bow
my
knees
unto
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
of
whom
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
is
named
that
he
would
grant
you
according
to
the
riches
of
his
glory
to
be
strengthened
with
might
by
his
spirit
in
the
inner
man
that
christ
may
dwell
in
your
hearts
by
faith
that
ye
being
rooted
and
grounded
in
love
may
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
saints
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
knowledge
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
all
the
fulness
of
god
now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
do
exceeding
abundantly
above
all
that
we
ask
or
think
according
to
the
power
that
worketh
in
us
unto
him
be
glory
in
the
church
by
christ
jesus
throughout
all
ages
world
without
end
amen
i
therefore
the
prisoner
of
the
lord
beseech
you
that
ye
walk
worthy
of
the
vocation
wherewith
ye
are
called
with
all
lowliness
and
meekness
with
longsuffering
forbearing
one
another
in
love
endeavouring
to
keep
the
unity
of
the
spirit
in
the
bond
of
peace
there
is
one
body
and
one
spirit
even
as
ye
are
called
in
one
hope
of
your
calling
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
god
and
father
of
all
who
is
above
all
and
through
all
and
in
you
all
but
unto
every
one
of
us
is
given
grace
according
to
the
measure
of
the
gift
of
christ
wherefore
he
saith
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
and
gave
gifts
unto
men
now
that
he
ascended
what
is
it
but
that
he
also
descended
first
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
he
that
descended
is
the
same
also
that
ascended
up
far
above
all
heavens
that
he
might
fill
all
things
and
he
gave
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
edifying
of
the
body
of
christ
till
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
man
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fulness
of
christ
that
we
henceforth
be
no
more
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
sleight
of
men
and
cunning
craftiness
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
but
speaking
the
truth
in
love
may
grow
up
into
him
in
all
things
which
is
the
head
even
christ
from
whom
the
whole
body
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
joint
supplieth
according
to
the
effectual
working
in
the
measure
of
every
part
maketh
increase
of
the
body
unto
the
edifying
of
itself
in
love
this
i
say
therefore
and
testify
in
the
lord
that
ye
henceforth
walk
not
as
other
gentiles
walk
in
the
vanity
of
their
mind
having
the
understanding
darkened
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
god
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
heart
who
being
past
feeling
have
given
themselves
over
unto
lasciviousness
to
work
all
uncleanness
with
greediness
but
ye
have
not
so
learned
christ
if
so
be
that
ye
have
heard
him
and
have
been
taught
by
him
as
the
truth
is
in
jesus
that
ye
put
off
concerning
the
former
conversation
the
old
man
which
is
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
lusts
and
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
mind
and
that
ye
put
on
the
new
man
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
holiness
wherefore
putting
away
lying
speak
every
man
truth
with
his
neighbour
for
we
are
members
one
of
another
be
ye
angry
and
sin
not
let
not
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
wrath
neither
give
place
to
the
devil
let
him
that
stole
steal
no
more
but
rather
let
him
labour
working
with
his
hands
the
thing
which
is
good
that
he
may
have
to
give
to
him
that
needeth
let
no
corrupt
communication
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
but
that
which
is
good
to
the
use
of
edifying
that
it
may
minister
grace
unto
the
hearers
and
grieve
not
the
holy
spirit
of
god
whereby
ye
are
sealed
unto
the
day
of
redemption
let
all
bitterness
and
wrath
and
anger
and
clamour
and
evil
speaking
be
put
away
from
you
with
all
malice
and
be
ye
kind
one
to
another
tenderhearted
forgiving
one
another
even
as
god
for
christ's
sake
hath
forgiven
you
be
ye
therefore
followers
of
god
as
dear
children
and
walk
in
love
as
christ
also
hath
loved
us
and
hath
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
sweetsmelling
savour
but
fornication
and
all
uncleanness
or
covetousness
let
it
not
be
once
named
among
you
as
becometh
saints
neither
filthiness
nor
foolish
talking
nor
jesting
which
are
not
convenient
but
rather
giving
of
thanks
for
this
ye
know
that
no
whoremonger
nor
unclean
person
nor
covetous
man
who
is
an
idolater
hath
any
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
and
of
god
let
no
man
deceive
you
with
vain
words
for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
be
not
ye
therefore
partakers
with
them
for
ye
were
sometimes
darkness
but
now
are
ye
light
in
the
lord
walk
as
children
of
light
for
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
proving
what
is
acceptable
unto
the
lord
and
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
of
darkness
but
rather
reprove
them
for
it
is
a
shame
even
to
speak
of
those
things
which
are
done
of
them
in
secret
but
all
things
that
are
reproved
are
made
manifest
by
the
light
for
whatsoever
doth
make
manifest
is
light
wherefore
he
saith
awake
thou
that
sleepest
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
christ
shall
give
thee
light
see
then
that
ye
walk
circumspectly
not
as
fools
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
are
evil
wherefore
be
ye
not
unwise
but
understanding
what
the
will
of
the
lord
is
and
be
not
drunk
with
wine
wherein
is
excess
but
be
filled
with
the
spirit
speaking
to
yourselves
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
singing
and
making
melody
in
your
heart
to
the
lord
giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
unto
god
and
the
father
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
submitting
yourselves
one
to
another
in
the
fear
of
god
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
for
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
and
he
is
the
saviour
of
the
body
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
every
thing
husbands
love
your
wives
even
as
christ
also
loved
the
church
and
gave
himself
for
it
that
he
might
sanctify
and
cleanse
it
with
the
washing
of
water
by
the
word
that
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
thing
but
that
it
should
be
holy
and
without
blemish
so
ought
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
he
that
loveth
his
wife
loveth
himself
for
no
man
ever
yet
hated
his
own
flesh
but
nourisheth
and
cherisheth
it
even
as
the
lord
the
church
for
we
are
members
of
his
body
of
his
flesh
and
of
his
bones
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
be
joined
unto
his
wife
and
they
two
shall
be
one
flesh
this
is
a
great
mystery
but
i
speak
concerning
christ
and
the
church
nevertheless
let
every
one
of
you
in
particular
so
love
his
wife
even
as
himself
and
the
wife
see
that
she
reverence
her
husband
children
obey
your
parents
in
the
lord
for
this
is
right
honour
thy
father
and
mother
which
is
the
first
commandment
with
promise
that
it
may
be
well
with
thee
and
thou
mayest
live
long
on
the
earth
and
ye
fathers
provoke
not
your
children
to
wrath
but
bring
them
up
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
servants
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
with
fear
and
trembling
in
singleness
of
your
heart
as
unto
christ
not
with
eyeservice
as
menpleasers
but
as
the
servants
of
christ
doing
the
will
of
god
from
the
heart
with
good
will
doing
service
as
to
the
lord
and
not
to
men
knowing
that
whatsoever
good
thing
any
man
doeth
the
same
shall
he
receive
of
the
lord
whether
he
be
bond
or
free
and
ye
masters
do
the
same
things
unto
them
forbearing
threatening
knowing
that
your
master
also
is
in
heaven
neither
is
there
respect
of
persons
with
him
finally
my
brethren
be
strong
in
the
lord
and
in
the
power
of
his
might
put
on
the
whole
armour
of
god
that
ye
may
be
able
to
stand
against
the
wiles
of
the
devil
for
we
wrestle
not
against
flesh
and
blood
but
against
principalities
against
powers
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
world
against
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places
wherefore
take
unto
you
the
whole
armour
of
god
that
ye
may
be
able
to
withstand
in
the
evil
day
and
having
done
all
to
stand
stand
therefore
having
your
loins
girt
about
with
truth
and
having
on
the
breastplate
of
righteousness
and
your
feet
shod
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
above
all
taking
the
shield
of
faith
wherewith
ye
shall
be
able
to
quench
all
the
fiery
darts
of
the
wicked
and
take
the
helmet
of
salvation
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
word
of
god
praying
always
with
all
prayer
and
supplication
in
the
spirit
and
watching
thereunto
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
for
all
saints
and
for
me
that
utterance
may
be
given
unto
me
that
i
may
open
my
mouth
boldly
to
make
known
the
mystery
of
the
gospel
for
which
i
am
an
ambassador
in
bonds
that
therein
i
may
speak
boldly
as
i
ought
to
speak
but
that
ye
also
may
know
my
affairs
and
how
i
do
tychicus
a
beloved
brother
and
faithful
minister
in
the
lord
shall
make
known
to
you
all
things
whom
i
have
sent
unto
you
for
the
same
purpose
that
ye
might
know
our
affairs
and
that
he
might
comfort
your
hearts

you

of
mine
for
you
all
making
request
with
joy
for
your
fellowship
in

gospel
from
the
first
day
until
now
being
confident
of
this
very
thing
that
he
which
hath
begun
a
good
work
in
you
will
perform
it
until
the
day
of
jesus
christ
even
as
it
is
meet
for
me
to
think
this
of
you
all
because
i
have
you
in
my
heart
inasmuch
as
both
in
my
bonds
and
in
the
defence
and
confirmation
of
the
gospel
ye
all
are
partakers
of
my
grace
for
god
is
my
record
how
greatly
i
long
after
you
all
in
the
bowels
of
jesus
christ
and
this
i
pray
that
your
love
may
abound
yet
more
and
more
in
knowledge
and
in
all
judgment
that
ye
may
approve
things
that
are
excellent
that
ye
may
be
sincere
and
without
offence
till
the
day
of
christ
being
filled
with
the
fruits
of
righteousness
which
are
by
jesus
christ
unto
the
glory
and
praise
of
god
but
i
would
ye
should
understand
brethren
that
the
things
which
happened
unto
me
have
fallen
out
rather
unto
the
furtherance
of
the
gospel
so
that
my
bonds
in
christ
are
manifest
in
all
the
palace
and
in
all
other
places
and
many
of
the
brethren
in
the
lord
waxing
confident
by
my
bonds
are
much
more
bold
to
speak
the
word
without
fear
some
indeed
preach
christ
even
of
envy
and
strife
and
some
also
of
good
will
the
one
preach
christ
of
contention
not
sincerely
supposing
to
add
affliction
to
my
bonds
but
the
other
of
love
knowing
that
i
am
set
for
the
defence
of
the
gospel
what
then
notwithstanding
every
way
whether
in
pretence
or
in
truth
christ
is
preached
and
i
therein
do
rejoice
yea
and
will
rejoice
for
i
know
that
this
shall
turn
to
my
salvation
through
your
prayer
and
the
supply
of
the
spirit
of
jesus
christ
according
to
my
earnest
expectation
and
my
hope
that
in
nothing
i
shall
be
ashamed
but
that
with
all
boldness
as
always
so
now
also
christ
shall
be
magnified
in
my
body
whether
it
be
by
life
or
by
death
for
to
me
to
live
is
christ
and
to
die
is
gain
but
if
i
live
in
the
flesh
this
is
the
fruit
of
my
labour
yet
what
i
shall
choose
i
wot
not
for
i
am
in
a
strait
betwixt
two
having
a
desire
to
depart
and
to
be
with
christ
which
is
far
better
nevertheless
to
abide
in
the
flesh
is
more
needful
for
you
and
having
this
confidence
i
know
that
i
shall
abide
and
continue
with
you
all
for
your
furtherance
and
joy
of
faith
that
your
rejoicing
may
be
more
abundant
in
jesus
christ
for
me
by
my
coming
to
you
again
only
let
your
conversation
be
as
it
becometh
the
gospel
of
christ
that
whether
i
come
and
see
you
or
else
be
absent
i
may
hear
of
your
affairs
that
ye
stand
fast
in
one
spirit
with
one
mind
striving
together
for
the
faith
of
the
gospel
and
in
nothing
terrified
by
your
adversaries
which
is
to
them
an
evident
token
of
perdition
but
to
you
of
salvation
and
that
of
god
for
unto
you
it
is
given
in
the
behalf
of
christ
not
only
to
believe
on
him
but
also
to
suffer
for
his
sake
having
the
same
conflict
which
ye
saw
in
me
and
now
hear
to
be
in
me
if
there
be
therefore
any
consolation
in
christ
if
any
comfort
of
love
if
any
fellowship
of
the
spirit
if
any
bowels
and
mercies
fulfil
ye
my
joy
that
ye
be
likeminded
having
the
same
love
being
of
one
accord
of
one
mind
let
nothing
be
done
through
strife
or
vainglory
but
in
lowliness
of
mind
let
each
esteem
other
better
than
themselves
look
not
every
man
on
his
own
things
but
every
man
also
on
the
things
of
others
let
this
mind
be
in
you
which
was
also
in
christ
jesus
who
being
in
the
form
of
god
thought
it
not
robbery
to
be
equal
with
god
but
made
himself
of
no
reputation
and
took
upon
him
the
form
of
a
servant
and
was
made
in
the
likeness
of
men
and
being
found
in
fashion
as
a
man
he
humbled
himself
and
became
obedient
unto
death
even
the
death
of
the
cross
wherefore
god
also
hath
highly
exalted
him
and
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
name
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
bow
of
things
in
heaven
and
things
in
earth
and
things
under
the
earth
and
that
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
wherefore
my
beloved
as
ye
have
always
obeyed
not
as
in
my
presence
only
but
now
much
more
in
my
absence
work
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
for
it
is
god
which
worketh
in
you
both
to
will
and
to
do
of
his
good
pleasure
do
all
things
without
murmurings
and
disputings
that
ye
may
be
blameless
and
harmless
the
sons
of
god
without
rebuke
in
the
midst
of
a
crooked
and
perverse
nation
among
whom
ye
shine
as
lights
in
the
world
holding
forth
the
word
of
life
that
i
may
rejoice
in
the
day
of
christ
that
i
have
not
run
in
vain
neither
laboured
in
vain
yea
and
if
i
be
offered
upon
the
sacrifice
and
service
of
your
faith
i
joy
and
rejoice
with
you
all
for
the
same
cause
also
do
ye
joy
and
rejoice
with
me
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
jesus
to
send
timotheus
shortly
unto
you
that
i
also
may
be
of
good
comfort
when
i
know
your
state
for
i
have
no
man
likeminded
who
will
naturally
care
for
your
state
for
all
seek
their
own
not
the
things
which
are
jesus
christ's
but
ye
know
the
proof
of
him
that
as
a
son
with
the
father
he
hath
served
with
me
in
the
gospel
him
therefore
i
hope
to
send
presently
so
soon
as
i
shall
see
how
it
will
go
with
me
but
i
trust
in
the
lord
that
i
also
myself
shall
come
shortly
yet
i
supposed
it
necessary
to
send
to
you
epaphroditus
my
brother
and
companion
in
labour
and
fellowsoldier
but
your
messenger
and
he
that
ministered
to
my
wants
for
he
longed
after
you
all
and
was
full
of
heaviness
because
that
ye
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick
for
indeed
he
was
sick
nigh
unto
death
but
god
had
mercy
on
him
and
not
on
him
only
but
on
me
also
lest
i
should
have
sorrow
upon
sorrow
i
sent
him
therefore
the
more
carefully
that
when
ye
see
him
again
ye
may
rejoice
and
that
i
may
be
the
less
sorrowful
receive
him
therefore
in
the
lord
with
all
gladness
and
hold
such
in
reputation
because
for
the
work
of
christ
he
was
nigh
unto
death
not
regarding
his
life
to
supply
your
lack
of
service
toward
me
finally
my
brethren
rejoice
in
the
lord
to
write
the
same
things
to
you
to
me
indeed
is
not
grievous
but
for
you
it
is
safe
beware
of
dogs
beware
of
evil
workers
beware
of
the
concision
for
we
are
the
circumcision
which
worship
god
in
the
spirit
and
rejoice
in
christ
jesus
and
have
no
confidence
in
the
flesh
though
i
might
also
have
confidence
in
the
flesh
if
any
other
man
thinketh
that
he
hath
whereof
he
might
trust
in
the
flesh
i
more
circumcised
the
eighth
day
of
the
stock
of
israel
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
an
hebrew
of
the
hebrews
as
touching
the
law
a
pharisee
concerning
zeal
persecuting
the
church
touching
the
righteousness
which
is
in
the
law
blameless
but
what
things
were
gain
to
me
those
i
counted
loss
for
christ
yea
doubtless
and
i
count
all
things
but
loss
for
the
excellency
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
jesus
my
lord
for
whom
i
have
suffered
the
loss
of
all
things
and
do
count
them
but
dung
that
i
may
win
christ
and
be
found
in
him
not
having
mine
own
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
but
that
which
is
through
the
faith
of
christ
the
righteousness
which
is
of
god
by
faith
that
i
may
know
him
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
and
the
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
being
made
conformable
unto
his
death
if
by
any
means
i
might
attain
unto
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
not
as
though
i
had
already
attained
either
were
already
perfect
but
i
follow
after
if
that
i
may
apprehend
that
for
which
also
i
am
apprehended
of
christ
jesus
brethren
i
count
not
myself
to
have
apprehended
but
this
one
thing
i
do
forgetting
those
things
which
are
behind
and
reaching
forth
unto
those
things
which
are
before
i
press
toward
the
mark
for
the
prize
of
the
high
calling
of
god
in
christ
jesus
let
us
therefore
as
many
as
be
perfect
be
thus
minded
and
if
in
any
thing
ye
be
otherwise
minded
god
shall
reveal
even
this
unto
you
nevertheless
whereto
we
have
already
attained
let
us
walk
by
the
same
rule
let
us
mind
the
same
thing
brethren
be
followers
together
of
me
and
mark
them
which
walk
so
as
ye
have
us
for
an
ensample
for
many
walk
of
whom
i
have
told
you
often
and
now
tell
you
even
weeping
that
they
are
the
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
whose
end
is
destruction
whose
god
is
their
belly
and
whose
glory
is
in
their
shame
who
mind
earthly
things
for
our
conversation
is
in
heaven
from
whence
also
we
look
for
the
saviour
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
change
our
vile
body
that
it
may
be
fashioned
like
unto
his
glorious
body
according
to
the
working
whereby
he
is
able
even
to
subdue
all
things
unto
himself
therefore
my
brethren
dearly
beloved
and
longed
for
my
joy
and
crown
so
stand
fast
in
the
lord
my
dearly
beloved
i
beseech
euodias
and
beseech
syntyche
that
they
be
of
the
same
mind
in
the
lord
and
i
intreat
thee
also
true
yokefellow
help
those
women
which
laboured
with
me
in
the
gospel
with
clement
also
and
with
other
my
fellowlabourers
whose
names
are
in
the
book
of
life
rejoice
in
the
lord
alway
and
again
i
say
rejoice
let
your
moderation
be
known
unto
all
men
the
lord
is
at
hand
be
careful
for
nothing
but
in
every
thing
by
prayer
and
supplication
with
thanksgiving
let
your
requests
be
made
known
unto
god
and
the
peace
of
god
which
passeth
all
understanding
shall
keep
your
hearts
and
minds
through
christ
jesus
finally
brethren
whatsoever
things
are
true
whatsoever
things
are
honest
whatsoever
things
are
just
whatsoever
things
are
pure
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
whatsoever
things
are
of
good
report
if
there
be
any
virtue
and
if
there
be
any
praise
think
on
these
things
those
things
which
ye
have
both
learned
and
received
and
heard
and
seen
in
me
do
and
the
god
of
peace
shall
be
with
you
but
i
rejoiced
in
the
lord
greatly
that
now
at
the
last
your
care
of
me
hath
flourished
again
wherein
ye
were
also
careful
but
ye
lacked
opportunity
not
that
i
speak
in
respect
of
want
for
i
have
learned
in
whatsoever
state
i
am
therewith
to
be
content
i
know
both
how
to
be
abased
and
i
know
how
to
abound
every
where
and
in
all
things
i
am
instructed
both
to
be
full
and
to
be
hungry
both
to
abound
and
to
suffer
need
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
which
strengtheneth
me
notwithstanding
ye
have
well
done
that
ye
did
communicate
with
my
affliction
now
ye
philippians
know
also
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
gospel
when
i
departed
from
macedonia
no
church
communicated
with
me
as
concerning
giving
and
receiving
but
ye
only
for
even
in
thessalonica
ye
sent
once
and
again
unto
my
necessity
not
because
i
desire
a
gift
but
i
desire
fruit
that
may
abound
to
your
account
but
i
have
all
and
abound
i
am
full
having
received
of
epaphroditus
the
things
which
were
sent
from
you
an
odour
of
a
sweet
smell
a
sacrifice
acceptable
wellpleasing
to
god
but
my
god
shall
supply
all
your
need
according
to
his
riches
in
glory
by
christ
jesus
now
unto
god
and
our
father
be
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen

that
are

we
give
thanks
to
god
and
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
praying
always
for
you
since
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
jesus
and
of
the
love
which
ye
have
to
all
the
saints
for
the
hope
which
is
laid
up
for
you
in
heaven
whereof
ye
heard
before
in
the
word
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
which
is
come
unto
you
as
it
is
in
all
the
world
and
bringeth
forth
fruit
as
it
doth
also
in
you
since
the
day
ye
heard
of
it
and
knew
the
grace
of
god
in
truth
as
ye
also
learned
of
epaphras
our
dear
fellowservant
who
is
for
you
a
faithful
minister
of
christ
who
also
declared
unto
us
your
love
in
the
spirit
for
this
cause
we
also
since
the
day
we
heard
it
do
not
cease
to
pray
for
you
and
to
desire
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
his
will
in
all
wisdom
and
spiritual
understanding
that
ye
might
walk
worthy
of
the
lord
unto
all
pleasing
being
fruitful
in
every
good
work
and
increasing
in
the
knowledge
of
god
strengthened
with
all
might
according
to
his
glorious
power
unto
all
patience
and
longsuffering
with
joyfulness
giving
thanks
unto
the
father
which
hath
made
us
meet
to
be
partakers
of
the
inheritance
of
the
saints
in
light
who
hath
delivered
us
from
the
power
of
darkness
and
hath
translated
us
into
the
kingdom
of
his
dear
son
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
even
the
forgiveness
of
sins
who
is
the
image
of
the
invisible
god
the
firstborn
of
every
creature
for
by
him
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
whether
they
be
thrones
or
dominions
or
principalities
or
powers
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
and
he
is
before
all
things
and
by
him
all
things
consist
and
he
is
the
head
of
the
body
the
church
who
is
the
beginning
the
firstborn
from
the
dead
that
in
all
things
he
might
have
the
preeminence
for
it
pleased
the
father
that
in
him
should
all
fulness
dwell
and
having
made
peace
through
the
blood
of
his
cross
by
him
to
reconcile
all
things
unto
himself
by
him
i
say
whether
they
be
things
in
earth
or
things
in
heaven
and
you
that
were
sometime
alienated
and
enemies
in
your
mind
by
wicked
works
yet
now
hath
he
reconciled
in
the
body
of
his
flesh
through
death
to
present
you
holy
and
unblameable
and
unreproveable
in
his
sight
if
ye
continue
in
the
faith
grounded
and
settled
and
be
not
moved
away
from
the
hope
of
the
gospel
which
ye
have
heard
and
which
was
preached
to
every
creature
which
is
under
heaven
whereof
i
paul
am
made
a
minister
who
now
rejoice
in
my
sufferings
for
you
and
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
in
my
flesh
for
his
body's
sake
which
is
the
church
whereof
i
am
made
a
minister
according
to
the
dispensation
of
god
which
is
given
to
me
for
you
to
fulfil
the
word
of
god
even
the
mystery
which
hath
been
hid
from
ages
and
from
generations
but
now
is
made
manifest
to
his
saints
to
whom
god
would
make
known
what
is
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
this
mystery
among
the
gentiles
which
is
christ
in
you
the
hope
of
glory
whom
we
preach
warning
every
man
and
teaching
every
man
in
all
wisdom
that
we
may
present
every
man
perfect
in
christ
jesus
whereunto
i
also
labour
striving
according
to
his
working
which
worketh
in
me
mightily
for
i
would
that
ye
knew
what
great
conflict
i
have
for
you
and
for
them
at
laodicea
and
for
as
many
as
have
not
seen
my
face
in
the
flesh
that
their
hearts
might
be
comforted
being
knit
together
in
love
and
unto
all
riches
of
the
full
assurance
of
understanding
to
the
acknowledgement
of
the
mystery
of
god
and
of
the
father
and
of
christ
in
whom
are
hid
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
this
i
say
lest
any
man
should
beguile
you
with
enticing
words
for
though
i
be
absent
in
the
flesh
yet
am
i
with
you
in
the
spirit
joying
and
beholding
your
order
and
the
stedfastness
of
your
faith
in
christ
as
ye
have
therefore
received
christ
jesus
the
lord
so
walk
ye
in
him
rooted
and
built
up
in
him
and
stablished
in
the
faith
as
ye
have
been
taught
abounding
therein
with
thanksgiving
beware
lest
any
man
spoil
you
through
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
after
the
tradition
of
men
after
the
rudiments
of
the
world
and
not
after
christ
for
in
him
dwelleth
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
bodily
and
ye
are
complete
in
him
which
is
the
head
of
all
principality
and
power
in
whom
also
ye
are
circumcised
with
the
circumcision
made
without
hands
in
putting
off
the
body
of
the
sins
of
the
flesh
by
the
circumcision
of
christ
buried
with
him
in
baptism
wherein
also
ye
are
risen
with
him
through
the
faith
of
the
operation
of
god
who
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
you
being
dead
in
your
sins
and
the
uncircumcision
of
your
flesh
hath
he
quickened
together
with
him
having
forgiven
you
all
trespasses
blotting
out
the
handwriting
of
ordinances
that
was
against
us
which
was
contrary
to
us
and
took
it
out
of
the
way
nailing
it
to
his
cross
and
having
spoiled
principalities
and
powers
he
made
a
shew
of
them
openly
triumphing
over
them
in
it
let
no
man
therefore
judge
you
in
meat
or
in
drink
or
in
respect
of
an
holyday
or
of
the
new
moon
or
of
the
sabbath
days
which
are
a
shadow
of
things
to
come
but
the
body
is
of
christ
let
no
man
beguile
you
of
your
reward
in
a
voluntary
humility
and
worshipping
of
angels
intruding
into
those
things
which
he
hath
not
seen
vainly
puffed
up
by
his
fleshly
mind
and
not
holding
the
head
from
which
all
the
body
by
joints
and
bands
having
nourishment
ministered
and
knit
together
increaseth
with
the
increase
of
god
wherefore
if
ye
be
dead
with
christ
from
the
rudiments
of
the
world
why
as
though
living
in
the
world
are
ye
subject
to
ordinances
touch
not
taste
not
handle
not
which
all
are
to
perish
with
the
using
after
the
commandments
and
doctrines
of
men
which
things
have
indeed
a
shew
of
wisdom
in
will
worship
and
humility
and
neglecting
of
the
body
not
in
any
honour
to
the
satisfying
of
the
flesh
if
ye
then
be
risen
with
christ
seek
those
things
which
are
above
where
christ
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
god
set
your
affection
on
things
above
not
on
things
on
the
earth
for
ye
are
dead
and
your
life
is
hid
with
christ
in
god
when
christ
who
is
our
life
shall
appear
then
shall
ye
also
appear
with
him
in
glory
mortify
therefore
your
members
which
are
upon
the
earth
fornication
uncleanness
inordinate
affection
evil
concupiscence
and
covetousness
which
is
idolatry
for
which
things
sake
the
wrath
of
god
cometh
on
the
children
of
disobedience
in
the
which
ye
also
walked
some
time
when
ye
lived
in
them
but
now
ye
also
put
off
all
these
anger
wrath
malice
blasphemy
filthy
communication
out
of
your
mouth
lie
not
one
to
another
seeing
that
ye
have
put
off
the
old
man
with
his
deeds
and
have
put
on
the
new
man
which
is
renewed
in
knowledge
after
the
image
of
him
that
created
him
where
there
is
neither
greek
nor
jew
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
barbarian
scythian
bond
nor
free
but
christ
is
all
and
in
all
put
on
therefore
as
the
elect
of
god
holy
and
beloved
bowels
of
mercies
kindness
humbleness
of
mind
meekness
longsuffering
forbearing
one
another
and
forgiving
one
another
if
any
man
have
a
quarrel
against
any
even
as
christ
forgave
you
so
also
do
ye
and
above
all
these
things
put
on
charity
which
is
the
bond
of
perfectness
and
let
the
peace
of
god
rule
in
your

to
the
which
also
ye
are

and
be

in

christ
in
the
sight
of
god
and
our
father
knowing
brethren
beloved
your
election
of
god
for
our
gospel
came
not
unto
you
in
word
only
but
also
in
power
and
in
the
holy
ghost
and
in
much
assurance
as
ye
know
what
manner
of
men
we
were
among
you
for
your
sake
and
ye
became
followers
of
us
and
of
the
lord
having
received
the
word
in
much
affliction
with
joy
of
the
holy
ghost
so
that
ye
were
ensamples
to
all
that
believe
in
macedonia
and
achaia
for
from
you
sounded
out
the
word
of
the
lord
not
only
in
macedonia
and
achaia
but
also
in
every
place
your
faith
to
god-ward
is
spread
abroad
so
that
we
need
not
to
speak
any
thing
for
they
themselves
shew
of
us
what
manner
of
entering
in
we
had
unto
you
and
how
ye
turned
to
god
from
idols
to
serve
the
living
and
true
god
and
to
wait
for
his
son
from
heaven
whom
he
raised
from
the
dead
even
jesus
which
delivered
us
from
the
wrath
to
come
for
yourselves
brethren
know
our
entrance
in
unto
you
that
it
was
not
in
vain
but
even
after
that
we
had
suffered
before
and
were
shamefully
entreated
as
ye
know
at
philippi
we
were
bold
in
our
god
to
speak
unto
you
the
gospel
of
god
with
much
contention
for
our
exhortation
was
not
of
deceit
nor
of
uncleanness
nor
in
guile
but
as
we
were
allowed
of
god
to
be
put
in
trust
with
the
gospel
even
so
we
speak
not
as
pleasing
men
but
god
which
trieth
our
hearts
for
neither
at
any
time
used
we
flattering
words
as
ye
know
nor
a
cloke
of
covetousness
god
is
witness
nor
of
men
sought
we
glory
neither
of
you
nor
yet
of
others
when
we
might
have
been
burdensome
as
the
apostles
of
christ
but
we
were
gentle
among
you
even
as
a
nurse
cherisheth
her
children
so
being
affectionately
desirous
of
you
we
were
willing
to
have
imparted
unto
you
not
the
gospel
of
god
only
but
also
our
own
souls
because
ye
were
dear
unto
us
for
ye
remember
brethren
our
labour
and
travail
for
labouring
night
and
day
because
we
would
not
be
chargeable
unto
any
of
you
we
preached
unto
you
the
gospel
of
god
ye
are
witnesses
and
god
also
how
holily
and
justly
and
unblameably
we
behaved
ourselves
among
you
that
believe
as
ye
know
how
we
exhorted
and
comforted
and
charged
every
one
of
you
as
a
father
doth
his
children
that
ye
would
walk
worthy
of
god
who
hath
called
you
unto
his
kingdom
and
glory
for
this
cause
also
thank
we
god
without
ceasing
because
when
ye
received
the
word
of
god
which
ye
heard
of
us
ye
received
it
not
as
the
word
of
men
but
as
it
is
in
truth
the
word
of
god
which
effectually
worketh
also
in
you
that
believe
for
ye
brethren
became
followers
of
the
churches
of
god
which
in
judaea
are
in
christ
jesus
for
ye
also
have
suffered
like
things
of
your
own
countrymen
even
as
they
have
of
the
jews
who
both
killed
the
lord
jesus
and
their
own
prophets
and
have
persecuted
us
and
they
please
not
god
and
are
contrary
to
all
men
forbidding
us
to
speak
to
the
gentiles
that
they
might
be
saved
to
fill
up
their
sins
alway
for
the
wrath
is
come
upon
them
to
the
uttermost
but
we
brethren
being
taken
from
you
for
a
short
time
in
presence
not
in
heart
endeavoured
the
more
abundantly
to
see
your
face
with
great
desire
wherefore
we
would
have
come
unto
you
even
i
paul
once
and
again
but
satan
hindered
us
for
what
is
our
hope
or
joy
or
crown
of
rejoicing
are
not
even
ye
in
the
presence
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
at
his
coming
for
ye
are
our
glory
and
joy
wherefore
when
we
could
no
longer
forbear
we
thought
it
good
to
be
left
at
athens
alone
and
sent
timotheus
our
brother
and
minister
of
god
and
our
fellowlabourer
in
the
gospel
of
christ
to
establish
you
and
to
comfort
you
concerning
your
faith
that
no
man
should
be
moved
by
these
afflictions
for
yourselves
know
that
we
are
appointed
thereunto
for
verily
when
we
were
with
you
we
told
you
before
that
we
should
suffer
tribulation
even
as
it
came
to
pass
and
ye
know
for
this
cause
when
i
could
no
longer
forbear
i
sent
to
know
your
faith
lest
by
some
means
the
tempter
have
tempted
you
and
our
labour
be
in
vain
but
now
when
timotheus
came
from
you
unto
us
and
brought
us
good
tidings
of
your
faith
and
charity
and
that
ye
have
good
remembrance
of
us
always
desiring
greatly
to
see
us
as
we
also
to
see
you
therefore
brethren
we
were
comforted
over
you
in
all
our
affliction
and
distress
by
your
faith
for
now
we
live
if
ye
stand
fast
in
the
lord
for
what
thanks
can
we
render
to
god
again
for
you
for
all
the
joy
wherewith
we
joy
for
your
sakes
before
our
god
night
and
day
praying
exceedingly
that
we
might
see
your
face
and
might
perfect
that
which
is
lacking
in
your
faith
now
god
himself
and
our
father
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
direct
our
way
unto
you
and
the
lord
make
you
to
increase
and
abound
in
love
one
toward
another
and
toward
all
men
even
as
we
do
toward
you
to
the
end
he
may
stablish
your
hearts
unblameable
in
holiness
before
god
even
our
father
at
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
with
all
his
saints
furthermore
then
we
beseech
you
brethren
and
exhort
you
by
the
lord
jesus
that
as
ye
have
received
of
us
how
ye
ought
to
walk
and
to
please
god
so
ye
would
abound
more
and
more
for
ye
know
what
commandments
we
gave
you
by
the
lord
jesus
for
this
is
the
will
of
god
even
your
sanctification
that
ye
should
abstain
from
fornication
that
every
one
of
you
should
know
how
to
possess
his
vessel
in
sanctification
and
honour
not
in
the
lust
of
concupiscence
even
as
the
gentiles
which
know
not
god
that
no
man
go
beyond
and
defraud
his
brother
in
any
matter
because
that
the
lord
is
the
avenger
of
all
such
as
we
also
have
forewarned
you
and
testified
for
god
hath
not
called
us
unto
uncleanness
but
unto
holiness
he
therefore
that
despiseth
despiseth
not
man
but
god
who
hath
also
given
unto
us
his
holy
spirit
but
as
touching
brotherly
love
ye
need
not
that
i
write
unto
you
for
ye
yourselves
are
taught
of
god
to
love
one
another
and
indeed
ye
do
it
toward
all
the
brethren
which
are
in
all
macedonia
but
we
beseech
you
brethren
that
ye
increase
more
and
more
and
that
ye
study
to
be
quiet
and
to
do
your
own
business
and
to
work
with
your
own
hands
as
we
commanded
you
that
ye
may
walk
honestly
toward
them
that
are
without
and
that
ye
may
have
lack
of
nothing
but
i
would
not
have
you
to
be
ignorant
brethren
concerning
them
which
are
asleep
that
ye
sorrow
not
even
as
others
which
have
no
hope
for
if
we
believe
that
jesus
died
and
rose
again
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
jesus
will
god
bring
with
him
for
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
asleep
for
the
lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
shout
with
the
voice
of
the
archangel
and
with
the
trump
of
god
and
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
then
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
lord
wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
words
but
of
the
times
and
the
seasons
brethren
ye
have
no
need
that
i
write
unto
you
for
yourselves
know
perfectly
that
the
day
of
the
lord
so
cometh
as
a
thief
in
the
night
for
when
they
shall
say
peace
and
safety
then
sudden
destruction
cometh
upon
them
as
travail
upon
a
woman
with
child
and
they
shall
not
escape
but
ye
brethren
are
not
in
darkness
that
that
day
should
overtake
you
as
a
thief
ye
are
all
the
children
of
light
and
the
children
of
the

that

the
night
but
let
us
who
are
of
the
day
be
sober
putting
on
the
breastplate
of
faith
and
love
and
for
an
helmet

hope
of
salvation
for
god
hath
not
appointed
us
to
wrath
but
to
obtain
salvation
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
died
for
us
that
whether
we
wake
or
sleep
we
should
live
together
with
him

comfort
yourselves
together

edify
one
another

with
you
amen
the
second
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
thessalonians
paul
and
silvanus
and
timotheus
unto
the
church
of
the
thessalonians
in

and
the
lord

grace
unto
you
and

from
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus

we
are
bound
to
thank
god
always
for
you
brethren
as
it
is
meet
because
that
your
faith
groweth
exceedingly
and
the
charity
of
every
one
of
you
all
toward
each
other
aboundeth
so
that
we
ourselves
glory
in
you
in
the
churches
of
god
for
your
patience
and
faith
in
all
your
persecutions
and
tribulations
that
ye
endure
which
is
a
manifest
token
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
that
ye
may
be
counted
worthy
of
the
kingdom
of
god
for
which
ye
also
suffer
seeing
it
is
a
righteous
thing
with
god
to
recompense
tribulation
to
them
that
trouble
you
and
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
us
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
heaven
with
his
mighty
angels
in
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
god
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
his
saints
and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
wherefore
also
we
pray
always
for
you
that
our
god
would
count
you
worthy
of
this
calling
and
fulfil
all
the
good
pleasure
of
his
goodness
and
the
work
of
faith
with
power
that
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
may
be
glorified
in
you
and
ye
in
him
according
to
the
grace
of
our
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
now
we
beseech
you
brethren
by
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
our
gathering
together
unto
him
that
ye
be
not
soon
shaken
in
mind
or
be
troubled
neither
by
spirit
nor
by
word
nor
by
letter
as
from
us
as
that
the
day
of
christ
is
at
hand
let
no
man
deceive
you
by
any
means
for
that
day
shall
not
come
except
there
come
a
falling
away
first
and
that
man
of
sin
be
revealed
the
son
of
perdition
who
opposeth
and
exalteth
himself
above
all
that
is
called
god
or
that
is
worshipped
so
that
he
as
god
sitteth
in
the
temple
of
god
shewing
himself
that
he
is
god
remember
ye
not
that
when
i
was
yet
with
you
i
told
you
these
things
and
now
ye
know
what
withholdeth
that
he
might
be
revealed
in
his
time
for
the
mystery
of
iniquity
doth
already
work
only
he
who
now
letteth
will
let
until
he
be
taken
out
of
the
way
and
then
shall
that
wicked
be
revealed
whom
the
lord
shall
consume
with
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
and
shall
destroy
with
the
brightness
of
his
coming
even
him
whose
coming
is
after
the
working
of
satan
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
wonders
and
with
all
deceivableness
of
unrighteousness
in
them
that
perish
because
they
received
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
they
might
be
saved
and
for
this
cause
god
shall
send
them
strong
delusion
that
they
should
believe
a
lie
that
they
all
might
be
damned
who
believed
not
the
truth
but
had
pleasure
in
unrighteousness
but
we
are
bound
to
give
thanks
alway
to
god
for
you
brethren
beloved
of
the
lord
because
god
hath
from
the
beginning
chosen
you
to
salvation
through
sanctification
of
the
spirit
and
belief
of
the
truth
whereunto
he
called
you
by
our
gospel
to
the
obtaining
of
the
glory
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
therefore
brethren
stand
fast
and
hold
the
traditions
which
ye
have
been
taught
whether
by
word
or
our
epistle
now
our
lord
jesus
christ
himself
and
god
even
our
father
which
hath
loved
us
and
hath
given
us
everlasting
consolation
and
good
hope
through
grace
comfort
your
hearts
and
stablish
you
in
every
good
word
and
work
finally
brethren
pray
for
us
that
the
word
of
the
lord
may
have
free
course
and
be
glorified
even
as
it
is
with
you
and
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
unreasonable
and
wicked
men
for
all
men
have
not
faith
but
the
lord
is
faithful
who
shall
stablish
you
and
keep
you
from
evil
and
we
have
confidence
in
the
lord
touching
you
that
ye
both
do
and
will
do
the
things
which
we
command
you
and
the
lord
direct
your
hearts
into
the
love
of
god
and
into
the
patient
waiting
for
christ
now
we
command
you
brethren
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
ye
withdraw
yourselves
from
every
brother
that
walketh
disorderly
and
not
after
the
tradition
which
he
received
of
us
for
yourselves
know
how
ye
ought
to
follow
us
for
we
behaved
not
ourselves
disorderly
among
you
neither
did
we
eat
any
man's
bread
for
nought
but
wrought
with
labour
and
travail
night
and
day
that
we
might
not
be
chargeable
to
any
of
you
not
because
we
have
not
power
but
to
make
ourselves
an
ensample
unto
you
to
follow
us
for
even
when
we
were
with
you
this
we
commanded
you
that
if
any
would
not
work
neither
should
he
eat
for
we
hear
that
there
are
some
which
walk
among
you
disorderly
working
not
at
all
but
are
busybodies
now
them
that
are
such
we
command
and
exhort
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
with
quietness
they
work
and
eat
their
own
bread
but
ye
brethren
be
not
weary
in
well
doing
and
if
any
man
obey
not
our
word
by
this
epistle
note
that
man
and
have
no
company
with
him
that
he
may
be
ashamed
yet
count
him
not
as
an
enemy
but
admonish
him
as
a
brother
now
the
lord
of
peace
himself
give
you
peace
always
by
all
means
the
lord
be
with
you
all
the
salutation
of
paul
with
mine
own
hand
which
is
the
token
in
every
epistle
so
i
write
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
be
with
you
all
amen
the
first
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
timothy
paul
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
by
the
commandment
of
god
our
saviour
and
lord
jesus
christ
which
is
our
hope
unto
timothy
my
own
son
in
the
faith
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
jesus
christ
our
lord
as
i
besought
thee
to
abide
still
at
ephesus
when
i
went
into
macedonia
that
thou
mightest
charge
some
that
they
teach
no
other
doctrine
neither
give
heed
to
fables
and
endless
genealogies
which
minister
questions
rather
than
godly
edifying
which
is
in
faith
so
do
now
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
charity
out
of
a
pure
heart
and
of
a
good
conscience
and
of
faith
unfeigned
from
which
some
having
swerved
have
turned
aside
unto
vain
jangling
desiring
to
be
teachers
of
the
law
understanding
neither
what
they
say
nor
whereof
they
affirm
but
we
know
that
the
law
is
good
if
a
man
use
it
lawfully
knowing
this
that
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
man
but
for
the
lawless
and
disobedient
for
the
ungodly
and
for
sinners
for
unholy
and
profane
for
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
mothers
for
manslayers
for
whoremongers
for
them
that
defile
themselves
with
mankind
for
menstealers
for
liars
for
perjured
persons
and
if
there
be
any
other
thing
that
is
contrary
to
sound
doctrine
according
to
the
glorious
gospel
of
the
blessed
god
which
was
committed
to
my
trust
and
i
thank
christ
jesus
our
lord
who
hath
enabled
me
for
that
he
counted
me
faithful
putting
me
into
the
ministry
who
was
before
a
blasphemer
and
a
persecutor
and
injurious
but
i
obtained
mercy
because
i
did
it
ignorantly
in
unbelief
and
the
grace
of
our
lord
was
exceeding
abundant
with
faith
and
love
which
is
in
christ
jesus
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation
that
christ
jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
of
whom
i
am
chief
howbeit
for
this
cause
i
obtained
mercy
that
in
me
first
jesus
christ
might
shew
forth
all
longsuffering
for
a
pattern
to
them
which
should
hereafter
believe
on
him
to
life
everlasting
now
unto
the
king
eternal
immortal
invisible
the
only
wise
god
be
honour
and
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
this
charge
i
commit
unto
thee
son
timothy
according
to
the
prophecies
which
went
before
on
thee
that
thou
by
them
mightest
war
a
good
warfare
holding
faith
and
a
good
conscience
which
some
having
put
away
concerning
faith
have
made
shipwreck
of
whom
is
hymenaeus
and
alexander
whom
i
have
delivered
unto
satan
that
they
may
learn
not
to
blaspheme
i
exhort
therefore
that
first
of
all
supplications
prayers
intercessions
and
giving
of
thanks
be
made
for
all
men
for
kings
and
for
all
that
are
in
authority
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
honesty
for
this
is
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
saviour
who
will
have
all
men
to
be
saved
and
to
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
for
there
is
one
god
and
one
mediator
between
god
and
men
the
man
christ
jesus
who
gave
himself
a
ransom
for
all
to
be
testified
in
due
time
whereunto
i
am
ordained
a
preacher
and
an
apostle
i
speak
the
truth
in
christ
and
lie
not
a
teacher
of
the
gentiles
in
faith
and
verity
i
will
therefore
that
men
pray
every
where
lifting
up
holy
hands
without
wrath
and
doubting
in
like
manner
also
that
women
adorn
themselves
in
modest
apparel
with
shamefacedness
and
sobriety
not
with
broided
hair
or
gold
or
pearls
or
costly
array
but
which
becometh
women
professing
godliness
with
good
works
let
the
woman
learn
in
silence
with
all
subjection
but
i
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
nor
to
usurp
authority
over
the
man
but
to
be
in
silence
for
adam
was
first
formed
then
eve
and
adam
was
not
deceived
but
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression
notwithstanding
she
shall
be
saved
in
childbearing
if
they
continue
in
faith
and
charity
and
holiness
with
sobriety
this
is
a
true
saying
if
a
man
desire
the
office
of
a
bishop
he
desireth
a
good
work
a
bishop
then
must
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
vigilant
sober
of
good
behaviour
given
to
hospitality
apt
to
teach
not
given
to
wine
no
striker
not
greedy
of
filthy
lucre
but
patient
not
a
brawler
not
covetous
one
that
ruleth
well
his
own
house
having
his
children
in
subjection
with
all
gravity
for
if
a
man
know
not
how
to
rule
his
own
house
how
shall
he
take
care
of
the
church
of
god
not
a
novice
lest
being
lifted
up
with
pride
he
fall
into
the
condemnation
of
the
devil
moreover
he
must
have
a
good
report
of
them
which
are
without
lest
he
fall
into
reproach
and
the
snare
of
the
devil
likewise
must
the
deacons
be
grave
not
doubletongued
not
given
to
much
wine
not
greedy
of
filthy
lucre
holding
the
mystery
of
the
faith
in
a
pure
conscience
and
let
these
also
first
be
proved
then
let
them
use
the
office
of
a
deacon
being
found
blameless
even
so
must
their
wives
be
grave
not
slanderers
sober
faithful
in
all
things
let
the
deacons
be
the
husbands
of
one
wife
ruling
their
children
and
their
own
houses
well
for
they
that
have
used
the
office
of
a
deacon
well
purchase
to
themselves
a
good
degree
and
great
boldness
in
the
faith
which
is
in
christ
jesus
these
things
write
i
unto
thee
hoping
to
come
unto
thee
shortly
but
if
i
tarry
long
that
thou
mayest
know
how
thou
oughtest
to
behave
thyself
in
the
house
of
god
which
is
the
church
of
the
living
god
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
and
without
controversy
great
is
the
mystery
of
godliness
god
was
manifest
in
the
flesh
justified
in
the
spirit
seen
of
angels
preached
unto
the
gentiles
believed
on
in
the
world
received
up
into
glory
now
the
spirit
speaketh
expressly
that
in
the
latter
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
seducing
spirits
and
doctrines
of
devils
speaking
lies
in
hypocrisy
having
their
conscience
seared
with
a
hot
iron
forbidding
to
marry
and
commanding
to
abstain
from
meats
which
god
hath
created
to
be
received
with
thanksgiving
of
them
which
believe
and
know
the
truth
for
every
creature
of
god
is
good
and
nothing
to
be
refused
if
it
be
received
with
thanksgiving
for
it
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
god
and
prayer
if
thou
put
the
brethren
in
remembrance
of
these
things
thou
shalt
be
a
good
minister
of
jesus
christ
nourished
up
in
the
words
of
faith
and
of
good
doctrine
whereunto
thou
hast
attained
but
refuse
profane
and
old
wives
fables
and
exercise
thyself
rather
unto
godliness
for
bodily
exercise
profiteth
little
but
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
things
having
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is
and
of
that
which
is
to
come
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
worthy
of
all
acceptation
for
therefore
we
both
labour
and
suffer
reproach
because
we
trust
in
the
living
god
who
is
the
saviour
of
all
men
specially
of
those
that
believe
these
things
command
and
teach
let
no
man
despise
thy
youth
but
be
thou
an
example
of
the
believers
in
word
in
conversation
in
charity
in
spirit
in
faith
in
purity
till
i
come
give
attendance
to
reading
to
exhortation
to
doctrine
neglect
not
the
gift
that
is
in
thee
which
was
given
thee
by
prophecy
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
presbytery
meditate
upon
these
things
give
thyself
wholly
to
them
that
thy
profiting
may
appear
to
all
take
heed
unto
thyself
and
unto
the
doctrine
continue
in
them
for
in
doing
this
thou
shalt
both
save
thyself
and
them
that
hear
thee
rebuke
not
an
elder
but
intreat
him
as
a
father
and
the
younger
men
as
brethren
the
elder
women
as
mothers
the
younger
as
sisters
with
all
purity
honour
widows
that
are
widows
indeed
but
if
any
widow
have
children
or
nephews
let
them
learn
first
to
shew
piety
at
home
and
to
requite
their
parents
for
that
is
good
and
acceptable
before
god
now
she
that
is
a
widow
indeed
and
desolate
trusteth
in
god
and
continueth
in
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
day
but
she
that
liveth
in
pleasure
is
dead
while
she
liveth
and
these
things
give
in
charge
that
they
may
be
blameless
but
if
any
provide
not
for
his
own
and
specially
for
those
of
his
own
house
he
hath
denied
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
an
infidel
let
not
a
widow
be
taken
into
the
number
under
threescore
years
old
having
been
the
wife
of
one
man
well
reported
of
for
good
works
if
she
have
brought
up
children
if
she
have
lodged
strangers
if
she
have
washed
the
saints
feet
if
she
have
relieved
the
afflicted
if
she
have
diligently
followed
every
good
work
but
the
younger
widows
refuse
for
when
they
have
begun
to
wax
wanton
against
christ
they
will
marry
having
damnation
because
they
have
cast
off
their
first
faith
and
withal
they
learn
to
be
idle
wandering
about
from
house
to
house
and
not
only
idle
but
tattlers
also
and
busybodies
speaking
things
which
they
ought
not
i
will
therefore
that
the
younger
women
marry
bear
children
guide
the
house
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully
for
some
are
already
turned
aside
after
satan
if
any
man
or
woman
that
believeth
have
widows
let
them
relieve
them
and
let
not
the
church
be
charged
that
it
may
relieve
them
that
are
widows
indeed
let
the
elders
that
rule
well
be
counted
worthy
of
double
honour
especially
they
who
labour
in
the
word
and
doctrine
for
the
scripture
saith
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
and
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
reward
against
an
elder
receive
not
an
accusation
but
before
two
or
three
witnesses
them
that
sin
rebuke
before
all
that
others
also
may
fear
i
charge
thee
before
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
elect
angels
that
thou
observe
these
things
without
preferring
one
before
another
doing
nothing
by
partiality
lay
hands
suddenly
on
no
man
neither
be
partaker
of
other
men's
sins
keep
thyself
pure
drink
no
longer
water
but
use
a
little
wine
for
thy
stomach's
sake
and
thine
often
infirmities
some
men's
sins
are
open
beforehand
going
before
to
judgment
and
some
men
they
follow
after
likewise
also
the
good
works
of
some
are
manifest
beforehand
and
they
that
are
otherwise
cannot
be
hid
let
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honour
that
the
name
of
god
and
his
doctrine
be
not
blasphemed
and
they
that
have
believing
masters
let
them
not
despise
them
because
they
are
brethren
but
rather
do
them
service
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved
partakers
of
the
benefit
these
things
teach
and
exhort
if
any
man
teach
otherwise
and
consent
not
to
wholesome
words
even
the
words
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
to
the
doctrine
which
is
according
to
godliness
he
is
proud
knowing
nothing
but
doting
about
questions
and
strifes
of
words
whereof
cometh
envy
strife
railings
evil
surmisings
perverse
disputings
of
men
of
corrupt
minds
and
destitute
of
the
truth
supposing
that
gain
is
godliness
from
such
withdraw
thyself
but
godliness
with
contentment
is
great
gain
for
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world
and
it
is
certain
we
can
carry
nothing
out
and
having
food
and
raiment
let
us
be
therewith
content
but
they
that
will
be
rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a
snare
and
into
many
foolish
and
hurtful
lusts
which
drown
men
in
destruction
and
perdition
for
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
which
while
some
coveted
after
they
have
erred
from
the
faith
and
pierced
themselves
through
with
many
sorrows
but
thou
o
man
of
god
flee
these
things
and
follow
after
righteousness
godliness
faith
love
patience
meekness
fight
the
good
fight
of
faith
lay
hold
on
eternal
life
whereunto
thou
art
also
called
and
hast
professed
a
good
profession
before
many
witnesses
i
give
thee
charge
in
the
sight
of
god
who
quickeneth
all
things
and
before
christ
jesus
who
before
pontius
pilate
witnessed
a
good
confession
that
thou
keep
this
commandment
without
spot
unrebukable
until
the
appearing
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
which
in
his
times
he
shall
shew
who
is
the
blessed
and
only
potentate
the
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
who
only
hath
immortality
dwelling
in
the
light
which
no
man
can
approach
unto
whom
no
man
hath
seen
nor
can
see
to
whom
be
honour
and
power
everlasting
amen
charge
them
that
are
rich
in
this
world
that
they
be
not
highminded
nor
trust
in
uncertain
riches
but
in
the
living
god
who
giveth
us
richly
all
things
to
enjoy
that
they
do
good
that
they
be
rich
in
good
works
ready
to
distribute
willing
to
communicate
laying
up
in
store
for
themselves
a
good
foundation
against
the
time
to
come
that
they
may
lay
hold
on
eternal
life
o
timothy
keep
that
which
is
committed
to
thy
trust
avoiding
profane
and
vain
babblings
and
oppositions
of
science
falsely
so
called
which
some
professing
have
erred
concerning
the
faith
grace

with
thee
amen
the
second
epistle
of

the
apostle
to
timothy
paul
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
by
the
will
of
god
according
to
the
promise
of
life
which
is
in
christ
jesus
to
timothy
my
dearly
beloved
son
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
christ
jesus
our
lord
i
thank
god
whom
i
serve
from
my
forefathers
with
pure
conscience
that
without
ceasing
i
have
remembrance
of
thee
in
my
prayers
night
and
day
greatly
desiring
to
see
thee
being
mindful
of
thy
tears
that
i
may
be
filled
with
joy
when
i
call
to
remembrance
the
unfeigned
faith
that
is
in
thee
which
dwelt
first
in
thy
grandmother
lois
and
thy
mother
eunice
and
i
am
persuaded
that
in
thee
also
wherefore
i
put
thee
in
remembrance
that
thou
stir
up
the
gift
of
god
which
is
in
thee
by
the
putting
on
of
my
hands
for
god
hath
not
given
us
the
spirit
of
fear
but
of
power
and
of
love
and
of
a
sound
mind
be
not
thou
therefore
ashamed
of
the
testimony
of
our
lord
nor
of
me
his
prisoner
but
be
thou
partaker
of
the
afflictions
of
the
gospel
according
to
the
power
of
god
who
hath
saved
us
and
called
us
with
an
holy
calling
not
according
to
our
works
but
according
to
his
own
purpose
and
grace
which
was
given
us
in
christ
jesus
before
the
world
began
but
is
now
made
manifest
by
the
appearing
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
who
hath
abolished
death
and
hath
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
gospel
whereunto
i
am
appointed
a
preacher
and
an
apostle
and
a
teacher
of
the
gentiles
for
the
which
cause
i
also
suffer
these
things
nevertheless
i
am
not
ashamed
for
i
know
whom
i
have
believed
and
am
persuaded
that
he
is
able
to
keep
that
which
i
have
committed
unto
him
against
that
day
hold
fast
the
form
of
sound
words
which
thou
hast
heard
of
me
in
faith
and
love
which
is
in
christ
jesus
that
good
thing
which
was
committed
unto
thee
keep
by
the
holy
ghost
which
dwelleth
in
us
this
thou
knowest
that
all
they
which
are
in
asia
be
turned
away
from
me
of
whom
are
phygellus
and
hermogenes
the
lord
give
mercy
unto
the
house
of
onesiphorus
for
he
oft
refreshed
me
and
was
not
ashamed
of
my
chain
but
when
he
was
in
rome
he
sought
me
out
very
diligently
and
found
me
the
lord
grant
unto
him
that
he
may
find
mercy
of
the
lord
in
that
day
and
in
how
many
things
he
ministered
unto
me
at
ephesus
thou
knowest
very
well
thou
therefore
my
son
be
strong
in
the
grace
that
is
in
christ
jesus
and
the
things
that
thou
hast
heard
of
me
among
many
witnesses
the
same
commit
thou
to
faithful
men
who
shall
be
able
to
teach
others
also
thou
therefore
endure
hardness
as
a
good
soldier
of
jesus
christ
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
that
he
may
please
him
who
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
soldier
and
if
a
man
also
strive
for
masteries
yet
is
he
not
crowned
except
he
strive
lawfully
the
husbandman
that
laboureth
must
be
first
partaker
of
the
fruits
consider
what
i
say
and
the
lord
give
thee
understanding
in
all
things
remember
that
jesus
christ
of
the
seed
of
david
was
raised
from
the
dead
according
to
my
gospel
wherein
i
suffer
trouble
as
an
evil
doer
even
unto
bonds
but
the
word
of
god
is
not
bound
therefore
i
endure
all
things
for
the
elect's
sakes
that
they
may
also
obtain
the
salvation
which
is
in
christ
jesus
with
eternal
glory
it
is
a
faithful
saying
for
if
we
be
dead
with
him
we
shall
also
live
with
him
if
we
suffer
we
shall
also
reign
with
him
if
we
deny
him
he
also
will
deny
us
if
we
believe
not
yet
he
abideth
faithful
he
cannot
deny
himself
of
these
things
put
them
in
remembrance
charging
them
before
the
lord
that
they
strive
not
about
words
to
no
profit
but
to
the
subverting
of
the
hearers
study
to
shew
thyself
approved
unto
god
a
workman
that
needeth
not
to
be
ashamed
rightly
dividing
the
word
of
truth
but
shun
profane
and
vain
babblings
for
they
will
increase
unto
more
ungodliness
and
their
word
will
eat
as
doth
a
canker
of
whom
is
hymenaeus
and
philetus
who
concerning
the
truth
have
erred
saying
that
the
resurrection
is
past
already
and
overthrow
the
faith
of
some
nevertheless
the
foundation
of
god
standeth
sure
having
this
seal
the
lord
knoweth
them
that
are
his
and
let
every
one
that
nameth
the
name
of
christ
depart
from
iniquity
but
in
a
great
house
there
are
not
only
vessels
of
gold
and
of
silver
but
also
of
wood
and
of
earth
and
some
to
honour
and
some
to
dishonour
if
a
man
therefore
purge
himself
from
these
he
shall
be
a
vessel
unto
honour
sanctified
and
meet
for
the
master's
use
and
prepared
unto
every
good
work
flee
also
youthful
lusts
but
follow
righteousness
faith
charity
peace
with
them
that
call
on
the
lord
out
of
a
pure
heart
but
foolish
and
unlearned
questions
avoid
knowing
that
they
do
gender
strifes
and
the
servant
of
the
lord
must
not
strive
but
be
gentle
unto
all
men
apt
to
teach
patient
in
meekness
instructing
those
that
oppose
themselves
if
god
peradventure
will
give
them
repentance
to
the
acknowledging
of
the
truth
and
that
they
may
recover
themselves
out
of
the
snare
of
the
devil
who
are
taken
captive
by
him
at
his
will
this
know
also
that
in
the
last
days
perilous
times
shall
come
for
men
shall
be
lovers
of
their
own
selves
covetous
boasters
proud
blasphemers
disobedient
to
parents
unthankful
unholy
without
natural
affection
trucebreakers
false
accusers
incontinent
fierce
despisers
of
those
that
are
good
traitors
heady
highminded
lovers
of
pleasures
more
than
lovers
of
god
having
a
form
of
godliness
but
denying
the
power
thereof
from
such
turn
away
for
of
this
sort
are
they
which
creep
into
houses
and
lead
captive
silly
women
laden
with
sins
led
away
with
divers
lusts
ever
learning
and
never
able
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
now
as
jannes
and
jambres
withstood
moses
so
do
these
also
resist
the
truth
men
of
corrupt
minds
reprobate
concerning
the
faith
but
they
shall
proceed
no
further
for
their
folly
shall
be
manifest
unto
all
men
as
their's
also
was
but
thou
hast
fully
known
my
doctrine
manner
of
life
purpose
faith
longsuffering
charity
patience
persecutions
afflictions
which
came
unto
me
at
antioch
at
iconium
at

what
persecutions
i
endured
but
out
of
them
all
the
lord
delivered
me
yea
and
all
that
will
live
godly
in
christ
jesus
shall
suffer
persecution
but
evil
men
and
seducers
shall
wax
worse
and
worse
deceiving
and
being
deceived
but
continue
thou
in
the
things
which
thou
hast
learned
and
hast
been
assured
of
knowing
of
whom
thou
hast
learned
them
and
that
from
a
child
thou
hast
known
the
holy
scriptures
which
are
able
to
make
thee
wise
unto
salvation
through
faith
which
is
in
christ
jesus
all
scripture
is
given
by
inspiration
of
god
and
is
profitable
for
doctrine
for
reproof
for
correction
for
instruction
in
righteousness
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
perfect
throughly
furnished
unto
all
good
works
i
charge
thee
therefore
before
god
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
at
his
appearing
and
his
kingdom
preach
the
word
be
instant
in
season
out
of
season
reprove
rebuke
exhort
with
all
longsuffering
and
doctrine
for
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
not
endure
sound
doctrine
but
after
their
own
lusts
shall
they
heap
to
themselves
teachers
having
itching
ears
and
they
shall
turn
away
their
ears
from
the
truth
and
shall
be
turned
unto
fables
but
watch
thou
in
all
things
endure
afflictions

the
work
of
an

which
is
committed
unto
me
according
to
the
commandment
of
god
our
saviour
to
titus
mine
own
son
after
the
common
faith
grace
mercy
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
our
saviour
for
this
cause
left
i
thee
in
crete
that
thou
shouldest
set
in
order
the
things
that
are
wanting
and
ordain
elders
in
every
city
as
i
had
appointed
thee
if
any
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
having
faithful
children
not
accused
of
riot
or
unruly
for
a
bishop
must
be
blameless
as
the
steward
of
god
not
selfwilled
not
soon
angry
not
given
to
wine
no
striker
not
given
to
filthy
lucre
but
a
lover
of
hospitality
a
lover
of
good
men
sober
just
holy
temperate
holding
fast
the
faithful
word
as
he
hath
been
taught
that
he
may
be
able
by
sound
doctrine
both
to
exhort
and
to
convince
the
gainsayers
for
there
are
many
unruly
and
vain
talkers
and
deceivers
specially
they
of
the
circumcision
whose
mouths
must
be
stopped
who
subvert
whole
houses
teaching
things
which
they
ought
not
for
filthy
lucre's
sake
one
of
themselves
even
a
prophet
of
their
own
said
the
cretians
are
alway
liars
evil
beasts
slow
bellies
this
witness
is
true
wherefore
rebuke
them
sharply
that
they
may
be
sound
in
the
faith
not
giving
heed
to
jewish
fables
and
commandments
of
men
that
turn
from
the
truth
unto
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
but
unto
them
that
are
defiled
and
unbelieving
is
nothing
pure
but
even
their
mind
and
conscience
is
defiled
they
profess
that
they
know
god
but
in
works
they
deny
him
being
abominable
and
disobedient
and
unto
every
good
work
reprobate
but
speak
thou
the
things
which
become
sound
doctrine
that
the
aged
men
be
sober
grave
temperate
sound
in
faith
in
charity
in
patience
the
aged
women
likewise
that
they
be
in
behaviour
as
becometh
holiness
not
false
accusers
not
given
to
much
wine
teachers
of
good
things
that
they
may
teach
the
young
women
to
be
sober
to
love
their
husbands
to
love
their
children
to
be
discreet
chaste
keepers
at
home
good
obedient
to
their
own
husbands
that
the
word
of
god
be
not
blasphemed
young
men
likewise
exhort
to
be
sober
minded
in
all
things
shewing
thyself
a
pattern
of
good
works
in
doctrine
shewing
uncorruptness
gravity
sincerity
sound
speech
that
cannot
be
condemned
that
he
that
is
of
the
contrary
part
may
be
ashamed
having
no
evil
thing
to
say
of
you
exhort
servants
to
be
obedient
unto
their
own
masters
and
to
please
them
well
in
all
things
not
answering
again
not
purloining
but
shewing
all
good
fidelity
that
they
may
adorn
the
doctrine
of
god
our
saviour
in
all
things
for
the
grace
of
god
that
bringeth
salvation
hath
appeared
to
all
men
teaching
us
that
denying
ungodliness
and
worldly
lusts
we
should
live
soberly
righteously
and
godly
in
this
present
world
looking
for
that
blessed
hope
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
who
gave
himself
for
us
that
he
might
redeem
us
from
all
iniquity
and
purify
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people
zealous
of
good
works
these
things
speak
and
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
authority
let
no
man
despise
thee
put
them
in
mind
to
be
subject
to
principalities
and
powers
to
obey
magistrates
to
be
ready
to
every
good
work
to
speak
evil
of
no
man
to
be
no
brawlers
but
gentle
shewing
all
meekness
unto
all
men
for
we
ourselves
also
were
sometimes
foolish
disobedient
deceived
serving
divers
lusts
and
pleasures
living
in
malice
and
envy
hateful
and
hating
one
another
but
after
that
the
kindness
and
love
of
god
our
saviour
toward
man
appeared
not
by
works
of
righteousness
which
we
have
done
but
according
to
his
mercy
he
saved
us
by
the
washing
of
regeneration
and
renewing
of
the
holy
ghost
which
he
shed
on
us
abundantly
through
jesus
christ
our
saviour
that
being
justified
by
his
grace
we
should
be
made
heirs
according
to
the
hope
of
eternal
life
this
is
a
faithful
saying
and
these
things
i
will
that
thou
affirm
constantly
that
they
which
have
believed
in
god
might
be
careful
to
maintain
good
works
these
things
are
good
and
profitable
unto
men
but
avoid
foolish
questions
and
genealogies
and
contentions
and
strivings
about
the
law
for
they
are
unprofitable
and
vain
a
man
that
is
an
heretick
after
the
first
and
second
admonition
reject
knowing
that
he
that
is
such
is
subverted
and
sinneth
being
condemned
of
himself
when
i
shall
send
artemas
unto
thee
or
tychicus
be
diligent
to
come
unto
me
to
nicopolis
for
i
have
determined
there
to
winter
bring
zenas
the
lawyer
and
apollos
on
their
journey
diligently
that
nothing
be
wanting
unto
them
and
let
our's
also
learn
to
maintain
good
works
for
necessary
uses
that
they
be
not
unfruitful
all
that
are
with
me
salute
thee
greet
them
that
love

to

paul
a
prisoner
of
jesus

our
brother
unto
philemon
our
dearly
beloved
and
fellowlabourer
and
to
our
beloved
apphia
and
archippus
our

and
to
the
church
in
thy
house
grace
to
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
the
lord
jesus
christ
i
thank
my
god
making
mention
of
thee
always
in
my
prayers
hearing
of
thy
love
and
faith
which
thou
hast
toward
the
lord
jesus
and
toward
all
saints
that
the
communication
of
thy
faith
may
become
effectual
by
the
acknowledging
of
every
good
thing
which
is
in
you
in
christ
jesus
for
we
have
great
joy
and
consolation
in
thy
love
because
the
bowels
of
the
saints
are
refreshed
by
thee
brother
wherefore
though
i
might
be
much
bold
in
christ
to
enjoin
thee
that
which
is
convenient
yet
for
love's
sake
i
rather
beseech
thee
being
such
an
one
as
paul
the
aged
and
now
also
a
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
i
beseech
thee
for
my
son
onesimus
whom
i
have
begotten
in
my
bonds
which
in
time
past
was
to
thee
unprofitable
but
now
profitable
to
thee
and
to
me
whom
i
have
sent
again
thou
therefore
receive
him
that
is
mine
own
bowels
whom
i
would
have
retained
with
me
that
in
thy
stead
he
might
have
ministered
unto
me
in
the
bonds
of
the
gospel
but
without
thy
mind
would
i
do
nothing
that
thy
benefit
should
not
be
as
it
were
of
necessity
but
willingly
for
perhaps
he
therefore
departed
for
a
season
that
thou
shouldest
receive
him
for
ever
not
now
as
a
servant
but
above
a
servant
a
brother
beloved
specially
to
me
but
how
much
more
unto
thee
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
lord
if
thou
count
me
therefore
a
partner
receive
him
as
myself
if
he
hath
wronged
thee
or
oweth
thee
ought
put
that
on
mine
account
i
paul
have
written
it
with
mine
own
hand
i
will
repay
it
albeit
i
do
not
say
to
thee
how
thou
owest
unto
me
even
thine
own
self
besides
yea
brother
let
me
have
joy
of
thee
in
the
lord
refresh
my
bowels
in
the
lord
having
confidence
in
thy
obedience
i
wrote
unto
thee
knowing
that
thou
wilt
also
do
more
than
i
say
but
withal
prepare
me
also
a
lodging
for
i
trust
that
through
your
prayers
i
shall
be
given
unto
you
there
salute
thee

amen
the
epistle
of
paul
the
apostle
to
the
hebrews
god
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
son
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
things
by
whom
also
he
made
the
worlds
who
being
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
the
express
image
of
his
person
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sins
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
high
being
made
so
much
better
than
the
angels
as
he
hath
by
inheritance
obtained
a
more
excellent
name
than
they
for
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
and
again
i
will
be
to
him
a
father
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
son
and
again
when
he
bringeth
in
the
firstbegotten
into
the
world
he
saith
and
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
him
and
of
the
angels
he
saith
who
maketh
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
fire
but
unto
the
son
he
saith
thy
throne
o
god
is
for
ever
and
ever
a
sceptre
of
righteousness
is
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
thou
hast
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
therefore
god
even
thy
god
hath
anointed
thee
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
thy
fellows
and
thou
lord
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
hands
they
shall
perish
but
thou
remainest
and
they
all
shall
wax
old
as
doth
a
garment
and
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
fold
them
up
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
not
fail
but
to
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time
sit
on
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
to
minister
for
them
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
therefore
we
ought
to
give
the
more
earnest
heed
to
the
things
which
we
have
heard
lest
at
any
time
we
should
let
them
slip
for
if
the
word
spoken
by
angels
was
stedfast
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a
just
recompence
of
reward
how
shall
we
escape
if
we
neglect
so
great
salvation
which
at
the
first
began
to
be
spoken
by
the
lord
and
was
confirmed
unto
us
by
them
that
heard
him
god
also
bearing
them
witness
both
with
signs
and
wonders
and
with
divers
miracles
and
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
according
to
his
own
will
for
unto
the
angels
hath
he
not
put
in
subjection
the
world
to
come
whereof
we
speak
but
one
in
a
certain
place
testified
saying
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
or
the
son
of
man
that
thou
visitest
him
thou
madest
him
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
thou
crownedst
him
with
glory
and
honour
and
didst
set
him
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
feet
for
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
him
he
left
nothing
that
is
not
put
under
him
but
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
him
but
we
see
jesus
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
death
crowned
with
glory
and
honour
that
he
by
the
grace
of
god
should
taste
death
for
every
man
for
it
became
him
for
whom
are
all
things
and
by
whom
are
all
things
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
glory
to
make
the
captain
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings
for
both
he
that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
are
all
of
one
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
brethren
saying
i
will
declare
thy
name
unto
my
brethren
in
the
midst
of
the
church
will
i
sing
praise
unto
thee
and
again
i
will
put
my
trust
in
him
and
again
behold
i
and
the
children
which
god
hath
given
me
forasmuch
then
as
the
children
are
partakers
of
flesh
and
blood
he
also
himself
likewise
took
part
of
the
same
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
that
is
the
devil
and
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
bondage
for
verily
he
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angels
but
he
took
on
him
the
seed
of
abraham
wherefore
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
his
brethren
that
he
might
be
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
in
things
pertaining
to
god
to
make
reconciliation
for
the
sins
of
the
people
for
in
that
he
himself
hath
suffered
being
tempted
he
is
able
to
succour
them
that
are
tempted
wherefore
holy
brethren
partakers
of
the
heavenly
calling
consider
the
apostle
and
high
priest
of
our
profession
christ
jesus
who
was
faithful
to
him
that
appointed
him
as
also
moses
was
faithful
in
all
his
house
for
this
man
was
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
moses
inasmuch
as
he
who
hath
builded
the
house
hath
more
honour
than
the
house
for
every
house
is
builded
by
some
man
but
he
that
built
all
things
is
god
and
moses
verily
was
faithful
in
all
his
house
as
a
servant
for
a
testimony
of
those
things
which
were
to
be
spoken
after
but
christ
as
a
son
over
his
own
house
whose
house
are
we
if
we
hold
fast
the
confidence
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
hope
firm
unto
the
end
wherefore
as
the
holy
ghost
saith
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
as
in
the
provocation
in
the
day
of
temptation
in
the
wilderness
when
your
fathers
tempted
me
proved
me
and
saw
my
works
forty
years
wherefore
i
was
grieved
with
that
generation
and
said
they
do
alway
err
in
their
heart
and
they
have
not
known
my
ways
so
i
sware
in
my
wrath
they
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest
take
heed
brethren
lest
there
be
in
any
of
you
an
evil
heart
of
unbelief
in
departing
from
the
living
god
but
exhort
one
another
daily
while
it
is
called
to
day
lest
any
of
you
be
hardened
through
the
deceitfulness
of
sin
for
we
are
made
partakers
of
christ
if
we
hold
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
stedfast
unto
the
end
while
it
is
said
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
as
in
the
provocation
for
some
when
they
had
heard
did
provoke
howbeit
not
all
that
came
out
of
egypt
by
moses
but
with
whom
was
he
grieved
forty
years
was
it
not
with
them
that
had
sinned
whose
carcases
fell
in
the
wilderness
and
to
whom
sware
he
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest
but
to
them
that
believed
not
so
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
unbelief
let
us
therefore
fear
lest
a
promise
being
left
us
of
entering
into
his
rest
any
of
you
should
seem
to
come
short
of
it
for
unto
us
was
the
gospel
preached
as
well
as
unto
them
but
the
word
preached
did
not
profit
them
not
being
mixed
with
faith
in
them
that
heard
it
for
we
which
have
believed
do
enter
into
rest
as
he
said
as
i
have
sworn
in
my
wrath
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest
although
the
works
were
finished
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
he
spake
in
a
certain
place
of
the
seventh
day
on
this
wise
and
god
did
rest
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
works
and
in
this
place
again
if
they
shall
enter
into
my
rest
seeing
therefore
it
remaineth
that
some
must
enter
therein
and
they
to
whom
it
was
first
preached
entered
not
in
because
of
unbelief
again
he
limiteth
a
certain
day
saying
in
david
to
day
after
so
long
a
time
as
it
is
said
to
day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
for
if
jesus
had
given
them
rest
then
would
he
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
day
there
remaineth
therefore
a
rest
to
the
people
of
god
for
he
that
is
entered
into
his
rest
he
also
hath
ceased
from
his
own
works
as
god
did
from
his
let
us
labour
therefore
to
enter
into
that
rest
lest
any
man
fall
after
the
same
example
of
unbelief
for
the
word
of
god
is
quick
and
powerful
and
sharper
than
any
twoedged
sword
piercing
even
to
the
dividing
asunder
of
soul
and
spirit
and
of
the
joints
and
marrow
and
is
a
discerner
of
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
neither
is
there
any
creature
that
is
not
manifest
in
his
sight
but
all
things
are
naked
and
opened
unto
the
eyes
of
him
with
whom
we
have
to
do
seeing
then
that
we
have
a
great
high
priest
that
is
passed
into
the
heavens
jesus
the
son
of
god
let
us
hold
fast
our
profession
for
we
have
not
an
high
priest
which
cannot
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
we
are
yet
without
sin
let
us
therefore
come
boldly
unto
the
throne
of
grace
that
we
may
obtain
mercy
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
need
for
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
ordained
for
men
in
things
pertaining
to
god
that
he
may
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins
who
can
have
compassion
on
the
ignorant
and
on
them
that
are
out
of
the
way
for
that
he
himself
also
is
compassed
with
infirmity
and
by
reason
hereof
he
ought
as
for
the
people
so
also
for
himself
to
offer
for
sins
and
no
man
taketh
this
honour
unto
himself
but
he
that
is
called
of
god
as
was
aaron
so
also
christ
glorified
not
himself
to
be
made
an
high
priest
but
he
that
said
unto
him
thou
art
my
son
to
day
have
i
begotten
thee
as
he
saith
also
in
another
place
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
who
in
the
days
of
his
flesh
when
he
had
offered
up
prayers
and
supplications
with
strong
crying
and
tears
unto
him
that
was
able
to
save
him
from
death
and
was
heard
in
that
he
feared
though
he
were
a
son
yet
learned
he
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
suffered
and
being
made
perfect
he
became
the
author
of
eternal
salvation
unto
all
them
that
obey
him
called
of
god
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
of
whom
we
have
many
things
to
say
and
hard
to
be
uttered
seeing
ye
are
dull
of
hearing
for
when
for
the
time
ye
ought
to
be
teachers
ye
have
need
that
one
teach
you
again
which
be
the
first
principles
of
the
oracles
of
god
and
are
become
such
as
have
need
of
milk
and
not
of
strong
meat
for
every
one
that
useth
milk
is
unskilful
in
the
word
of
righteousness
for
he
is
a
babe
but
strong
meat
belongeth
to
them
that
are
of
full
age
even
those
who
by
reason
of
use
have
their
senses
exercised
to
discern
both
good
and
evil
therefore
leaving
the
principles
of
the
doctrine
of
christ
let
us
go
on
unto
perfection
not
laying
again
the
foundation
of
repentance
from
dead
works
and
of
faith
toward
god
of
the
doctrine
of
baptisms
and
of
laying
on
of
hands
and
of
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
of
eternal
judgment
and
this
will
we
do
if
god
permit
for
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
were
once
enlightened
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
gift
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
holy
ghost
and
have
tasted
the
good
word
of
god
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
if
they
shall
fall
away
to
renew
them
again
unto
repentance
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
afresh
and
put
him
to
an
open
shame
for
the
earth
which
drinketh
in
the
rain
that
cometh
oft
upon
it
and
bringeth
forth
herbs
meet
for
them
by
whom
it
is
dressed
receiveth
blessing
from
god
but
that
which
beareth
thorns
and
briers
is
rejected
and
is
nigh
unto
cursing
whose
end
is
to
be
burned
but
beloved
we
are
persuaded
better
things
of
you
and
things
that
accompany
salvation
though
we
thus
speak
for
god
is
not
unrighteous
to
forget
your
work
and
labour
of
love
which
ye
have
shewed
toward
his
name
in
that
ye
have
ministered
to
the
saints
and
do
minister
and
we
desire
that
every
one
of
you
do
shew
the
same
diligence
to
the
full
assurance
of
hope
unto
the
end
that
ye
be
not
slothful
but
followers
of
them
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
promises
for
when
god
made
promise
to
abraham
because
he
could
swear
by
no
greater
he
sware
by
himself
saying
surely
blessing
i
will
bless
thee
and
multiplying
i
will
multiply
thee
and
so
after
he
had
patiently
endured
he
obtained
the
promise
for
men
verily
swear
by
the
greater
and
an
oath
for
confirmation
is
to
them
an
end
of
all
strife
wherein
god
willing
more
abundantly
to
shew
unto
the
heirs
of
promise
the
immutability
of
his
counsel
confirmed
it
by
an
oath
that
by
two
immutable
things
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
god
to
lie
we
might
have
a
strong
consolation
who
have
fled
for
refuge
to
lay
hold
upon
the
hope
set
before
us
which
hope
we
have
as
an
anchor
of
the
soul
both
sure
and
stedfast
and
which
entereth
into
that
within
the
veil
whither
the
forerunner
is
for
us
entered
even
jesus
made
an
high
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
for
this
melchisedec
king
of
salem
priest
of
the
most
high
god
who
met
abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
kings
and
blessed
him
to
whom
also
abraham
gave
a
tenth
part
of
all
first
being
by
interpretation
king
of
righteousness
and
after
that
also
king
of
salem
which
is
king
of
peace
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
life
but
made
like
unto
the
son
of
god
abideth
a
priest
continually
now
consider
how
great
this
man
was
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
abraham
gave
the
tenth
of
the
spoils
and
verily
they
that
are
of
the
sons
of
levi
who
receive
the
office
of
the
priesthood
have
a
commandment
to
take
tithes
of
the
people
according
to
the
law
that
is
of
their
brethren
though
they
come
out
of
the
loins
of
abraham
but
he
whose
descent
is
not
counted
from
them
received
tithes
of
abraham
and
blessed
him
that
had
the
promises
and
without
all
contradiction
the
less
is
blessed
of
the
better
and
here
men
that
die
receive
tithes
but
there
he
receiveth
them
of
whom
it
is
witnessed
that
he
liveth
and
as
i
may
so
say
levi
also
who
receiveth
tithes
payed
tithes
in
abraham
for
he
was
yet
in
the
loins
of
his
father
when
melchisedec
met
him
if
therefore
perfection
were
by
the
levitical
priesthood
for
under
it
the
people
received
the
law
what
further
need
was
there
that
another
priest
should
rise
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
and
not
be
called
after
the
order
of
aaron
for
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
law
for
he
of
whom
these
things
are
spoken
pertaineth
to
another
tribe
of
which
no
man
gave
attendance
at
the
altar
for
it
is
evident
that
our
lord
sprang
out
of
juda
of
which
tribe
moses
spake
nothing
concerning
priesthood
and
it
is
yet
far
more
evident
for
that
after
the
similitude
of
melchisedec
there
ariseth
another
priest
who
is
made
not
after
the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment
but
after
the
power
of
an
endless
life
for
he
testifieth
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
for
there
is
verily
a
disannulling
of
the
commandment
going
before
for
the
weakness
and
unprofitableness
thereof
for
the
law
made
nothing
perfect
but
the
bringing
in
of
a
better
hope
did
by
the
which
we
draw
nigh
unto
god
and
inasmuch
as
not
without
an
oath
he
was
made
priest
for
those
priests
were
made
without
an
oath
but
this
with
an
oath
by
him
that
said
unto
him
the
lord
sware
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
by
so
much
was
jesus
made
a
surety
of
a
better
testament
and
they
truly
were
many
priests
because
they
were
not
suffered
to
continue
by
reason
of
death
but
this
man
because
he
continueth
ever
hath
an
unchangeable
priesthood
wherefore
he
is
able
also
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
god
by
him
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
them
for
such
an
high
priest
became
us
who
is
holy
harmless
undefiled
separate
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
who
needeth
not
daily
as
those
high
priests
to
offer
up
sacrifice
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
the
people's
for
this
he
did
once
when
he
offered
up
himself
for
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity
but
the
word
of
the
oath
which
was
since
the
law
maketh
the
son
who
is
consecrated
for
evermore
now
of
the
things
which
we
have
spoken
this
is
the
sum
we
have
such
an
high
priest
who
is
set
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
the
majesty
in
the
heavens
a
minister
of
the
sanctuary
and
of
the
true
tabernacle
which
the
lord
pitched
and
not
man
for
every
high
priest
is
ordained
to
offer
gifts
and
sacrifices
wherefore
it
is
of
necessity
that
this
man
have
somewhat
also
to
offer
for
if
he
were
on
earth
he
should
not
be
a
priest
seeing
that
there
are
priests
that
offer
gifts
according
to
the
law
who
serve
unto
the
example
and
shadow
of
heavenly
things
as
moses
was
admonished
of
god
when
he
was
about
to
make
the
tabernacle
for
see
saith
he
that
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewed
to
thee
in
the
mount
but
now
hath
he
obtained
a
more
excellent
ministry
by
how
much
also
he
is
the
mediator
of
a
better
covenant
which
was
established
upon
better
promises
for
if
that
first
covenant
had
been
faultless
then
should
no
place
have
been
sought
for
the
second
for
finding
fault
with
them
he
saith
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
when
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
when
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
because
they
continued
not
in
my
covenant
and
i
regarded
them
not
saith
the
lord
for
this
is
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
laws
into
their
mind
and
write
them
in
their
hearts
and
i
will
be
to
them
a
god
and
they
shall
be
to
me
a
people
and
they
shall
not
teach
every
man
his
neighbour
and
every
man
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
for
all
shall
know
me
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
for
i
will
be
merciful
to
their
unrighteousness
and
their
sins
and
their
iniquities
will
i
remember
no
more
in
that
he
saith
a
new
covenant
he
hath
made
the
first
old
now
that
which
decayeth
and
waxeth
old
is
ready
to
vanish
away
then
verily
the
first
covenant
had
also
ordinances
of
divine
service
and
a
worldly
sanctuary
for
there
was
a
tabernacle
made
the
first
wherein
was
the
candlestick
and
the
table
and
the
shewbread
which
is
called
the
sanctuary
and
after
the
second
veil
the
tabernacle
which
is
called
the
holiest
of
all
which
had
the
golden
censer
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
overlaid
round
about
with
gold
wherein
was
the
golden
pot
that
had
manna
and
aaron's
rod
that
budded
and
the
tables
of
the
covenant
and
over
it
the
cherubims
of
glory
shadowing
the
mercyseat
of
which
we
cannot
now
speak
particularly
now
when
these
things
were
thus
ordained
the
priests
went
always
into
the
first
tabernacle
accomplishing
the
service
of
god
but
into
the
second
went
the
high
priest
alone
once
every
year
not
without
blood
which
he
offered
for
himself
and
for
the
errors
of
the
people
the
holy
ghost
this
signifying
that
the
way
into
the
holiest
of
all
was
not
yet
made
manifest
while
as
the
first
tabernacle
was
yet
standing
which
was
a
figure
for
the
time
then
present
in
which
were
offered
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
that
could
not
make
him
that
did
the
service
perfect
as
pertaining
to
the
conscience
which
stood
only
in
meats
and
drinks
and
divers
washings
and
carnal
ordinances
imposed
on
them
until
the
time
of
reformation
but
christ
being
come
an
high
priest
of
good
things
to
come
by
a
greater
and
more
perfect
tabernacle
not
made
with
hands
that
is
to
say
not
of
this
building
neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
calves
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
place
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
for
us
for
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
unclean
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
flesh
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
christ
who
through
the
eternal
spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
god
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
god
and
for
this
cause
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
testament
that
by
means
of
death
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
testament
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
inheritance
for
where
a
testament
is
there
must
also
of
necessity
be
the
death
of
the
testator
for
a
testament
is
of
force
after
men
are
dead
otherwise
it
is
of
no
strength
at
all
while
the
testator
liveth
whereupon
neither
the
first
testament
was
dedicated
without
blood
for
when
moses
had
spoken
every
precept
to
all
the
people
according
to
the
law
he
took
the
blood
of
calves
and
of
goats
with
water
and
scarlet
wool
and
hyssop
and
sprinkled
both
the
book
and
all
the
people
saying
this
is
the
blood
of
the
testament
which
god
hath
enjoined
unto
you
moreover
he
sprinkled
with
blood
both
the
tabernacle
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
ministry
and
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
blood
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
the
patterns
of
things
in
the
heavens
should
be
purified
with
these
but
the
heavenly
things
themselves
with
better
sacrifices
than
these
for
christ
is
not
entered
into
the
holy
places
made
with
hands
which
are
the
figures
of
the
true
but
into
heaven
itself
now
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
god
for
us
nor
yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
often
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holy
place
every
year
with
blood
of
others
for
then
must
he
often
have
suffered
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
now
once
in
the
end
of
the
world
hath
he
appeared
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
and
as
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to
die
but
after
this
the
judgment
so
christ
was
once
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
many
and
unto
them
that
look
for
him
shall
he
appear
the
second
time
without
sin
unto
salvation
for
the
law
having
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
come
and
not
the
very
image
of
the
things
can
never
with
those
sacrifices
which
they
offered
year
by
year
continually
make
the
comers
thereunto
perfect
for
then
would
they
not
have
ceased
to
be
offered
because
that
the
worshippers
once
purged
should
have
had
no
more
conscience
of
sins
but
in
those
sacrifices
there
is
a
remembrance
again
made
of
sins
every
year
for
it
is
not
possible
that
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
should
take
away
sins
wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
world
he
saith
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldest
not
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hast
had
no
pleasure
then
said
i
lo
i
come
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
to
do
thy
will
o
god
above
when
he
said
sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt
offerings
and
offering
for
sin
thou
wouldest
not
neither
hadst
pleasure
therein
which
are
offered
by
the
law
then
said
he
lo
i
come
to
do
thy
will
o
god
he
taketh
away
the
first
that
he
may
establish
the
second
by
the
which
will
we
are
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ
once
for
all
and
every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
sacrifices
which
can
never
take
away
sins
but
this
man
after
he
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
ever
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
god
from
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
be
made
his
footstool
for
by
one
offering
he
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
sanctified
whereof
the
holy
ghost
also
is
a
witness
to
us
for
after
that
he
had
said
before
this
is
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
them
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
laws
into
their
hearts
and
in
their
minds
will
i
write
them
and
their
sins
and
iniquities
will
i
remember
no
more
now
where
remission
of
these
is
there
is
no
more
offering
for
sin
having
therefore
brethren
boldness
to
enter
into
the
holiest
by
the
blood
of
jesus
by
a
new
and
living
way
which
he
hath
consecrated
for
us
through
the
veil
that
is
to
say
his
flesh
and
having
an
high
priest
over
the
house
of
god
let
us
draw
near
with
a
true
heart
in
full
assurance
of
faith
having
our
hearts
sprinkled
from
an
evil
conscience
and
our
bodies
washed
with
pure
water
let
us
hold
fast
the
profession
of
our
faith
without
wavering
for
he
is
faithful
that
promised
and
let
us
consider
one
another
to
provoke
unto
love
and
to
good
works
not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
together
as
the
manner
of
some
is
but
exhorting
one
another
and
so
much
the
more
as
ye
see
the
day
approaching
for
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
sins
but
a
certain
fearful
looking
for
of
judgment
and
fiery
indignation
which
shall
devour
the
adversaries
he
that
despised
moses
law
died
without
mercy
under
two
or
three
witnesses
of
how
much
sorer
punishment
suppose
ye
shall
he
be
thought
worthy
who
hath
trodden
under
foot
the
son
of
god
and
hath
counted
the
blood
of
the
covenant
wherewith
he
was
sanctified
an
unholy
thing
and
hath
done
despite
unto
the
spirit
of
grace
for
we
know
him
that
hath
said
vengeance
belongeth
unto
me
i
will
recompense
saith
the
lord
and
again
the
lord
shall
judge
his
people
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
but
call
to
remembrance
the
former
days
in
which
after
ye
were
illuminated
ye
endured
a
great
fight
of
afflictions
partly
whilst
ye
were
made
a
gazingstock
both
by
reproaches
and
afflictions
and
partly
whilst
ye
became
companions
of
them
that
were
so
used
for
ye
had
compassion
of
me
in
my
bonds
and
took
joyfully
the
spoiling
of
your
goods
knowing
in
yourselves
that
ye
have
in
heaven
a
better
and
an
enduring
substance
cast
not
away
therefore
your
confidence
which
hath
great
recompence
of
reward
for
ye
have
need
of
patience
that
after
ye
have
done
the
will
of
god
ye
might
receive
the
promise
for
yet
a
little
while
and
he
that
shall
come
will
come
and
will
not
tarry
now
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
but
if
any
man
draw
back
my
soul
shall
have
no
pleasure
in
him
but
we
are
not
of
them
who
draw
back
unto
perdition
but
of
them
that
believe
to
the
saving
of
the
soul
now
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
for
by
it
the
elders
obtained
a
good
report
through
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
god
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
do
appear
by
faith
abel
offered
unto
god
a
more
excellent
sacrifice
than
cain
by
which
he
obtained
witness
that
he
was
righteous
god
testifying
of
his
gifts
and
by
it
he
being
dead
yet
speaketh
by
faith
enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
death
and
was
not
found
because
god
had
translated
him
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
testimony
that
he
pleased
god
but
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
him
for
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
him
by
faith
noah
being
warned
of
god
of
things
not
seen
as
yet
moved
with
fear
prepared
an
ark
to
the
saving
of
his
house
by
the
which
he
condemned
the
world
and
became
heir
of
the
righteousness
which
is
by
faith
by
faith
abraham
when
he
was
called
to
go
out
into
a
place
which
he
should
after
receive
for
an
inheritance
obeyed
and
he
went
out
not
knowing
whither
he
went
by
faith
he
sojourned
in
the
land
of
promise
as
in
a
strange
country
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
isaac
and
jacob
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
through
faith
also
sara
herself
received
strength
to
conceive
seed
and
was
delivered
of
a
child
when
she
was
past
age
because
she
judged
him
faithful
who
had
promised
therefore
sprang
there
even
of
one
and
him
as
good
as
dead
so
many
as
the
stars
of
the
sky
in
multitude
and
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
shore
innumerable
these
all
died
in
faith
not
having
received
the
promises
but
having
seen
them
afar
off
and
were
persuaded
of
them
and
embraced
them
and
confessed
that
they
were
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth
for
they
that
say
such
things
declare
plainly
that
they
seek
a
country
and
truly
if
they
had
been
mindful
of
that
country
from
whence
they
came
out
they
might
have
had
opportunity
to
have
returned
but
now
they
desire
a
better
country
that
is
an
heavenly
wherefore
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
god
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
city
by
faith
abraham
when
he
was
tried
offered
up
isaac
and
he
that
had
received
the
promises
offered
up
his
only
begotten
son
of
whom
it
was
said
that
in
isaac
shall
thy
seed
be
called
accounting
that
god
was
able
to
raise
him
up
even
from
the
dead
from
whence
also
he
received
him
in
a
figure
by
faith
isaac
blessed
jacob
and
esau
concerning
things
to
come
by
faith
jacob
when
he
was
a
dying
blessed
both
the
sons
of
joseph
and
worshipped
leaning
upon
the
top
of
his
staff
by
faith
joseph
when
he
died
made
mention
of
the
departing
of
the
children
of
israel
and
gave
commandment
concerning
his
bones
by
faith
moses
when
he
was
born
was
hid
three
months
of
his
parents
because
they
saw
he
was
a
proper
child
and
they
were
not
afraid
of
the
king's
commandment
by
faith
moses
when
he
was
come
to
years
refused
to
be
called
the
son
of
pharaoh's
daughter
choosing
rather
to
suffer
affliction
with
the
people
of
god
than
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
sin
for
a
season
esteeming
the
reproach
of
christ
greater
riches
than
the
treasures
in
egypt
for
he
had
respect
unto
the
recompence
of
the
reward
by
faith
he
forsook
egypt
not
fearing
the
wrath
of
the
king
for
he
endured
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible
through
faith
he
kept
the
passover
and
the
sprinkling
of
blood
lest
he
that
destroyed
the
firstborn
should
touch
them
by
faith
they
passed
through
the
red
sea
as
by
dry
land
which
the
egyptians
assaying
to
do
were
drowned
by
faith
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
down
after
they
were
compassed
about
seven
days
by
faith
the
harlot
rahab
perished
not
with
them
that
believed
not
when
she
had
received
the
spies
with
peace
and
what
shall
i
more
say
for
the
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
gedeon
and
of
barak
and
of
samson
and
of
jephthae
of
david
also
and
samuel
and
of
the
prophets
who
through
faith
subdued
kingdoms
wrought
righteousness
obtained
promises
stopped
the
mouths
of
lions
quenched
the
violence
of
fire
escaped
the
edge
of
the
sword
out
of
weakness
were
made
strong
waxed
valiant
in
fight
turned
to
flight
the
armies
of
the
aliens
women
received
their
dead
raised
to
life
again
and
others
were
tortured
not
accepting
deliverance
that
they
might
obtain
a
better
resurrection
and
others
had
trial
of
cruel
mockings
and
scourgings
yea
moreover
of
bonds
and
imprisonment
they
were
stoned
they
were
sawn
asunder
were
tempted
were
slain
with
the
sword
they
wandered
about
in
sheepskins
and
goatskins
being
destitute
afflicted
tormented
of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
they
wandered
in
deserts
and
in
mountains
and
in
dens
and
caves
of
the
earth
and
these
all
having
obtained
a
good
report
through
faith
received
not
the
promise
god
having
provided
some
better
thing
for
us
that
they
without
us
should
not
be
made
perfect
wherefore
seeing
we
also
are
compassed
about
with
so
great
a
cloud
of
witnesses
let
us
lay
aside
every
weight
and
the
sin
which
doth
so
easily
beset
us
and
let
us
run
with
patience
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
looking
unto
jesus
the
author
and
finisher
of
our
faith
who
for
the
joy
that
was
set
before
him
endured
the
cross
despising
the
shame
and
is
set
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
god
for
consider
him
that
endured
such
contradiction
of
sinners
against
himself
lest
ye
be
wearied
and
faint
in
your
minds
ye
have
not
yet
resisted
unto
blood
striving
against
sin
and
ye
have
forgotten
the
exhortation
which
speaketh
unto
you
as
unto
children
my
son
despise
not
thou
the
chastening
of
the
lord
nor
faint
when
thou
art
rebuked
of
him
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
and
scourgeth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth
if
ye
endure
chastening
god
dealeth
with
you
as
with
sons
for
what
son
is
he
whom
the
father
chasteneth
not
but
if
ye
be
without
chastisement
whereof
all
are
partakers
then
are
ye
bastards
and
not
sons
furthermore
we
have
had
fathers
of
our
flesh
which
corrected
us
and
we
gave
them
reverence
shall
we
not
much
rather
be
in
subjection
unto
the
father
of
spirits
and
live
for
they
verily
for
a
few
days
chastened
us
after
their
own
pleasure
but
he
for
our
profit
that
we
might
be
partakers
of
his
holiness
now
no
chastening
for
the
present
seemeth
to
be
joyous
but
grievous
nevertheless
afterward
it
yieldeth
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
unto
them
which
are
exercised
thereby
wherefore
lift
up
the
hands
which
hang
down
and
the
feeble
knees
and
make
straight
paths
for
your
feet
lest
that
which
is
lame
be
turned
out
of
the
way
but
let
it
rather
be
healed
follow
peace
with
all
men
and
holiness
without
which
no
man
shall
see
the
lord
looking
diligently
lest
any
man
fail
of
the
grace
of
god
lest
any
root
of
bitterness
springing
up
trouble
you
and
thereby
many
be
defiled
lest
there
be
any
fornicator
or
profane
person
as
esau
who
for
one
morsel
of
meat
sold
his
birthright
for
ye
know
how
that
afterward
when
he
would
have
inherited
the
blessing
he
was
rejected
for
he
found
no
place
of
repentance
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears
for
ye
are
not
come
unto
the
mount
that
might
be
touched
and
that
burned
with
fire
nor
unto
blackness
and
darkness
and
tempest
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
the
voice
of
words
which
voice
they
that
heard
intreated
that
the
word
should
not
be
spoken
to
them
any
more
for
they
could
not
endure
that
which
was
commanded
and
if
so
much
as
a
beast
touch
the
mountain
it
shall
be
stoned
or
thrust
through
with
a
dart
and
so
terrible
was
the
sight
that
moses
said
i
exceedingly
fear
and
quake
but
ye
are
come
unto
mount
sion
and
unto
the
city
of
the
living
god
the
heavenly
jerusalem
and
to
an
innumerable
company
of
angels
to
the
general
assembly
and
church
of
the
firstborn
which
are
written
in
heaven
and
to
god
the
judge
of
all
and
to
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
and
to
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
and
to
the
blood
of
sprinkling
that
speaketh
better
things
than
that
of
abel
see
that
ye
refuse
not
him
that
speaketh
for
if
they
escaped
not
who
refused
him
that
spake
on
earth
much
more
shall
not
we
escape
if
we
turn
away
from
him
that
speaketh
from
heaven
whose
voice
then
shook
the
earth
but
now
he
hath
promised
saying
yet
once
more
i
shake
not
the
earth
only
but
also
heaven
and
this
word
yet
once
more
signifieth
the
removing
of
those
things
that
are
shaken
as
of
things
that
are
made
that
those
things
which
cannot
be
shaken
may
remain
wherefore
we
receiving
a
kingdom
which
cannot
be
moved
let
us
have
grace
whereby
we
may
serve
god
acceptably
with
reverence
and
godly
fear
for
our
god
is
a
consuming
fire
let
brotherly
love
continue
be
not
forgetful
to
entertain
strangers
for
thereby
some
have
entertained
angels
unawares
remember
them
that
are
in
bonds
as
bound
with
them
and
them
which
suffer
adversity
as
being
yourselves
also
in
the
body
marriage
is
honourable
in
all
and
the
bed
undefiled
but
whoremongers
and
adulterers
god
will
judge
let
your
conversation
be
without
covetousness
and
be
content
with
such
things
as
ye
have
for
he
hath
said
i
will
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
so
that
we
may
boldly
say
the
lord
is
my
helper
and
i
will
not
fear
what
man
shall
do
unto
me
remember
them
which
have
the
rule
over
you
who
have
spoken
unto
you
the
word
of
god
whose
faith
follow
considering
the
end
of
their
conversation
jesus
christ
the
same
yesterday
and
to
day
and
for
ever
be
not
carried
about
with
divers
and
strange
doctrines
for
it
is
a
good
thing
that
the
heart
be
established
with
grace
not
with
meats
which
have
not
profited
them
that
have
been
occupied
therein
we
have
an
altar
whereof
they
have
no
right
to
eat
which
serve
the
tabernacle
for
the
bodies
of
those
beasts
whose
blood
is
brought
into
the
sanctuary
by
the
high
priest
for
sin
are
burned
without
the
camp
wherefore
jesus
also
that
he
might
sanctify
the
people
with
his
own
blood
suffered
without
the
gate
let
us
go
forth
therefore
unto
him
without
the
camp
bearing
his
reproach
for
here
have
we
no
continuing
city
but
we
seek
one
to
come
by
him
therefore
let
us
offer
the
sacrifice
of
praise
to
god
continually
that
is
the
fruit
of
our
lips
giving
thanks
to
his
name
but
to
do
good
and
to
communicate
forget
not
for
with
such
sacrifices
god
is
well
pleased
obey
them
that
have
the
rule
over
you
and
submit
yourselves
for
they
watch
for
your
souls
as
they
that
must
give
account
that
they
may
do
it
with
joy
and
not
with
grief
for
that
is
unprofitable
for
you
pray
for
us
for
we
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
in
all
things
willing
to
live
honestly
but
i
beseech

the
general
epistle
of
james
james
a
servant
of
god
and
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
to
the
twelve
tribes
which
are
scattered
abroad
greeting
my
brethren
count
it
all
joy
when
ye
fall
into
divers
temptations
knowing
this
that
the
trying
of
your
faith
worketh
patience
but
let
patience
have
her
perfect
work
that
ye
may
be
perfect
and
entire
wanting
nothing
if
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
but
let
him
ask
in
faith
nothing
wavering
for
he
that
wavereth
is
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
driven
with
the
wind
and
tossed
for
let
not
that
man
think
that
he
shall
receive
any
thing
of
the
lord
a
double
minded
man
is
unstable
in
all
his
ways
let
the
brother
of
low
degree
rejoice
in
that
he
is
exalted
but
the
rich
in
that
he
is
made
low
because
as
the
flower
of
the
grass
he
shall
pass
away
for
the
sun
is
no
sooner
risen
with
a
burning
heat
but
it
withereth
the
grass
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
and
the
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
perisheth
so
also
shall
the
rich
man
fade
away
in
his
ways
blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
for
when
he
is
tried
he
shall
receive
the
crown
of
life
which
the
lord
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him
let
no
man
say
when
he
is
tempted
i
am
tempted
of
god
for
god
cannot
be
tempted
with
evil
neither
tempteth
he
any
man
but
every
man
is
tempted
when
he
is
drawn
away
of
his
own
lust
and
enticed
then
when
lust
hath
conceived
it
bringeth
forth
sin
and
sin
when
it
is
finished
bringeth
forth
death
do
not
err
my
beloved
brethren
every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
with
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
of
his
own
will
begat
he
us
with
the
word
of
truth
that
we
should
be
a
kind
of
firstfruits
of
his
creatures
wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
let
every
man
be
swift
to
hear
slow
to
speak
slow
to
wrath
for
the
wrath
of
man
worketh
not
the
righteousness
of
god
wherefore
lay
apart
all
filthiness
and
superfluity
of
naughtiness
and
receive
with
meekness
the
engrafted
word
which
is
able
to
save
your
souls
but
be
ye
doers
of
the
word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
your
own
selves
for
if
any
be
a
hearer
of
the
word
and
not
a
doer
he
is
like
unto
a
man
beholding
his
natural
face
in
a
glass
for
he
beholdeth
himself
and
goeth
his
way
and
straightway
forgetteth
what
manner
of
man
he
was
but
whoso
looketh
into
the
perfect
law
of
liberty
and
continueth
therein
he
being
not
a
forgetful
hearer
but
a
doer
of
the
work
this
man
shall
be
blessed
in
his
deed
if
any
man
among
you
seem
to
be
religious
and
bridleth
not
his
tongue
but
deceiveth
his
own
heart
this
man's
religion
is
vain
pure
religion
and
undefiled
before
god
and
the
father
is
this
to
visit
the
fatherless
and
widows
in
their
affliction
and
to
keep
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
my
brethren
have
not
the
faith
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
lord
of
glory
with
respect
of
persons
for
if
there
come
unto
your
assembly
a
man
with
a
gold
ring
in
goodly
apparel
and
there
come
in
also
a
poor
man
in
vile
raiment
and
ye
have
respect
to
him
that
weareth
the
gay
clothing
and
say
unto
him
sit
thou
here
in
a
good
place
and
say
to
the
poor
stand
thou
there
or
sit
here
under
my
footstool
are
ye
not
then
partial
in
yourselves
and
are
become
judges
of
evil
thoughts
hearken
my
beloved
brethren
hath
not
god
chosen
the
poor
of
this
world
rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of
the
kingdom
which
he
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him
but
ye
have
despised
the
poor
do
not
rich
men
oppress
you
and
draw
you
before
the
judgment
seats
do
not
they
blaspheme
that
worthy
name
by
the
which
ye
are
called
if
ye
fulfil
the
royal
law
according
to
the
scripture
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
ye
do
well
but
if
ye
have
respect
to
persons
ye
commit
sin
and
are
convinced
of
the
law
as
transgressors
for
whosoever
shall
keep
the
whole
law
and
yet
offend
in
one
point
he
is
guilty
of
all
for
he
that
said
do
not
commit
adultery
said
also
do
not
kill
now
if
thou
commit
no
adultery
yet
if
thou
kill
thou
art
become
a
transgressor
of
the
law
so
speak
ye
and
so
do
as
they
that
shall
be
judged
by
the
law
of
liberty
for
he
shall
have
judgment
without
mercy
that
hath
shewed
no
mercy
and
mercy
rejoiceth
against
judgment
what
doth
it
profit
my
brethren
though
a
man
say
he
hath
faith
and
have
not
works
can
faith
save
him
if
a
brother
or
sister
be
naked
and
destitute
of
daily
food
and
one
of
you
say
unto
them
depart
in
peace
be
ye
warmed
and
filled
notwithstanding
ye
give
them
not
those
things
which
are
needful
to
the
body
what
doth
it
profit
even
so
faith
if
it
hath
not
works
is
dead
being
alone
yea
a
man
may
say
thou
hast
faith
and
i
have
works
shew
me
thy
faith
without
thy
works
and
i
will
shew
thee
my
faith
by
my
works
thou
believest
that
there
is
one
god
thou
doest
well
the
devils
also
believe
and
tremble
but
wilt
thou
know
o
vain
man
that
faith
without
works
is
dead
was
not
abraham
our
father
justified
by
works
when
he
had
offered
isaac
his
son
upon
the
altar
seest
thou
how
faith
wrought
with
his
works
and
by
works
was
faith
made
perfect
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
which
saith
abraham
believed
god
and
it
was
imputed
unto
him
for
righteousness
and
he
was
called
the
friend
of
god
ye
see
then
how
that
by
works
a
man
is
justified
and
not
by
faith
only
likewise
also
was
not
rahab
the
harlot
justified
by
works
when
she
had
received
the
messengers
and
had
sent
them
out
another
way
for
as
the
body
without
the
spirit
is
dead
so
faith
without
works
is
dead
also
my
brethren
be
not
many
masters
knowing
that
we
shall
receive
the
greater
condemnation
for
in
many
things
we
offend
all
if
any
man
offend
not
in
word
the
same
is
a
perfect
man
and
able
also
to
bridle
the
whole
body
behold
we
put
bits
in
the
horses
mouths
that
they
may
obey
us
and
we
turn
about
their
whole
body
behold
also
the
ships
which
though
they
be
so
great
and
are
driven
of
fierce
winds
yet
are
they
turned
about
with
a
very
small
helm
whithersoever
the
governor
listeth
even
so
the
tongue
is
a
little
member
and
boasteth
great
things
behold
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
and
the
tongue
is
a
fire
a
world
of
iniquity
so
is
the
tongue
among
our
members
that
it
defileth
the
whole
body
and
setteth
on
fire
the
course
of
nature
and
it
is
set
on
fire
of
hell
for
every
kind
of
beasts
and
of
birds
and
of
serpents
and
of
things
in
the
sea
is
tamed
and
hath
been
tamed
of
mankind
but
the
tongue
can
no
man
tame
it
is
an
unruly
evil
full
of
deadly
poison
therewith
bless
we
god
even
the
father
and
therewith
curse
we
men
which
are
made
after
the
similitude
of
god
out
of
the
same
mouth
proceedeth
blessing
and
cursing
my
brethren
these
things
ought
not
so
to
be
doth
a
fountain
send
forth
at
the
same
place
sweet
water
and
bitter
can
the
fig
tree
my
brethren
bear
olive
berries
either
a
vine
figs
so
can
no
fountain
both
yield
salt
water
and
fresh
who
is
a
wise
man
and
endued
with
knowledge
among
you
let
him
shew
out
of
a
good
conversation
his
works
with
meekness
of
wisdom
but
if
ye
have
bitter
envying
and
strife
in
your
hearts
glory
not
and
lie
not
against
the
truth
this
wisdom
descendeth
not
from
above
but
is
earthly
sensual
devilish
for
where
envying
and
strife
is
there
is
confusion
and
every
evil
work
but
the
wisdom
that
is
from
above
is
first
pure
then
peaceable
gentle
and
easy
to
be
intreated
full
of
mercy
and
good
fruits
without
partiality
and
without
hypocrisy
and
the
fruit
of
righteousness
is
sown
in
peace
of
them
that
make
peace
from
whence
come
wars
and
fightings
among
you
come
they
not
hence
even
of
your
lusts
that
war
in
your
members
ye
lust
and
have
not
ye
kill
and
desire
to
have
and
cannot
obtain
ye
fight
and
war
yet
ye
have
not
because
ye
ask
not
ye
ask
and
receive
not
because
ye
ask
amiss
that
ye
may
consume
it
upon
your
lusts
ye
adulterers
and
adulteresses
know
ye
not
that
the
friendship
of
the
world
is
enmity
with
god
whosoever
therefore
will
be
a
friend
of
the
world
is
the
enemy
of
god
do
ye
think
that
the
scripture
saith
in
vain
the
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
us
lusteth
to
envy
but
he
giveth
more
grace
wherefore
he
saith
god
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
humble
submit
yourselves
therefore
to
god
resist
the
devil
and
he
will
flee
from
you
draw
nigh
to
god
and
he
will
draw
nigh
to
you
cleanse
your
hands
ye
sinners
and
purify
your
hearts
ye
double
minded
be
afflicted
and
mourn
and
weep
let
your
laughter
be
turned
to
mourning
and
your
joy
to
heaviness
humble
yourselves
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
lift
you
up
speak
not
evil
one
of
another
brethren
he
that
speaketh
evil
of
his
brother
and
judgeth
his
brother
speaketh
evil
of
the
law
and
judgeth
the
law
but
if
thou
judge
the
law
thou
art
not
a
doer
of
the
law
but
a
judge
there
is
one
lawgiver
who
is
able
to
save
and
to
destroy
who
art
thou
that
judgest
another
go
to
now
ye
that
say
to
day
or
to
morrow
we
will
go
into
such
a
city
and
continue
there
a
year
and
buy
and
sell
and
get
gain
whereas
ye
know
not
what
shall
be
on
the
morrow
for
what
is
your
life
it
is
even
a
vapour
that
appeareth
for
a
little
time
and
then
vanisheth
away
for
that
ye
ought
to
say
if
the
lord
will
we
shall
live
and
do
this
or
that
but
now
ye
rejoice
in
your
boastings
all
such
rejoicing
is
evil
therefore
to
him
that
knoweth
to
do
good
and
doeth
it
not
to
him
it
is
sin
go
to
now
ye
rich
men
weep
and
howl
for
your
miseries
that
shall
come
upon
you
your
riches
are
corrupted
and
your
garments
are
motheaten
your
gold
and
silver
is
cankered
and
the
rust
of
them
shall
be
a
witness
against
you
and
shall
eat
your
flesh
as
it
were
fire
ye
have
heaped
treasure
together
for
the
last
days
behold
the
hire
of
the
labourers
who
have
reaped
down
your
fields
which
is
of
you
kept
back
by
fraud
crieth
and
the
cries
of
them
which
have
reaped
are
entered
into
the
ears
of
the
lord
of
sabaoth
ye
have
lived
in
pleasure
on
the
earth
and
been
wanton
ye
have
nourished
your
hearts
as
in
a
day
of
slaughter
ye
have
condemned
and
killed
the
just

doth
not

you
be
patient
therefore
brethren
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
behold
the
husbandman
waiteth
for
the
precious
fruit
of
the
earth
and
hath
long
patience
for
it
until

your
hearts
for
the
coming
of
the
lord

against
another
brethren
lest
ye
be
condemned
behold
the
judge
standeth
before
the
door
take
my
brethren
the
prophets
who
have
spoken
in
the
name
of
the
lord
for
an
example
of
suffering
affliction
and
of
patience
behold
we
count
them
happy
which
endure
ye
have
heard
of
the
patience
of
job
and
have
seen
the
end
of
the
lord
that
the

pitiful
and
of
tender
mercy
but
above
all
things
my
brethren
swear
not
neither
by

not
rain
and
it
rained
not
on
the
earth
by
the
space
of
three
years

six
months

of
the
grace
that
should
come
unto
you
searching
what
or
what
manner
of
time
the
spirit
of
christ
which
was
in
them
did
signify
when
it
testified
beforehand
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
the
glory
that
should
follow
unto
whom
it
was
revealed
that
not
unto
themselves
but
unto
us
they
did
minister
the
things
which
are
now
reported
unto
you
by
them
that
have
preached
the
gospel
unto
you
with
the
holy
ghost
sent
down
from
heaven
which
things
the
angels
desire
to
look
into
wherefore
gird
up
the
loins
of
your
mind
be
sober
and
hope
to
the
end
for
the
grace
that
is
to
be
brought
unto
you
at
the
revelation
of
jesus
christ
as
obedient
children
not
fashioning
yourselves
according
to
the
former
lusts
in
your
ignorance
but
as
he
which
hath
called
you
is
holy
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation
because
it
is
written
be
ye
holy
for
i
am
holy
and
if
ye
call
on
the
father
who
without
respect
of
persons
judgeth
according
to
every
man's
work
pass
the
time
of
your
sojourning
here
in
fear
forasmuch
as
ye
know
that
ye
were
not
redeemed
with
corruptible
things
as
silver
and
gold
from
your
vain
conversation
received
by
tradition
from
your
fathers
but
with
the
precious
blood
of
christ
as
of
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
spot
who
verily
was
foreordained
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
was
manifest
in
these
last
times
for
you
who
by
him
do
believe
in
god
that
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
and
gave
him
glory
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
god
seeing
ye
have
purified
your
souls
in
obeying
the
truth
through
the
spirit
unto
unfeigned
love
of
the
brethren
see
that
ye
love
one
another
with
a
pure
heart
fervently
being
born
again
not
of
corruptible
seed
but
of
incorruptible
by
the
word
of
god
which
liveth
and
abideth
for
ever
for
all
flesh
is
as
grass
and
all
the
glory
of
man
as
the
flower
of
grass
the
grass
withereth
and
the
flower
thereof
falleth
away
but
the
word
of
the
lord
endureth
for
ever
and
this
is
the
word
which
by
the
gospel
is
preached
unto
you
wherefore
laying
aside
all
malice
and
all
guile
and
hypocrisies
and
envies
all
evil
speakings
as
newborn
babes
desire
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
that
ye
may
grow
thereby
if
so
be
ye
have
tasted
that
the
lord
is
gracious
to
whom
coming
as
unto
a
living
stone
disallowed
indeed
of
men
but
chosen
of
god
and
precious
ye
also
as
lively
stones
are
built
up
a
spiritual
house
an
holy
priesthood
to
offer
up
spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to
god
by
jesus
christ
wherefore
also
it
is
contained
in
the
scripture
behold
i
lay
in
sion
a
chief
corner
stone
elect
precious
and
he
that
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
confounded
unto
you
therefore
which
believe
he
is
precious
but
unto
them
which
be
disobedient
the
stone
which
the
builders
disallowed
the
same
is
made
the
head
of
the
corner
and
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
a
rock
of
offence
even
to
them
which
stumble
at
the
word
being
disobedient
whereunto
also
they
were
appointed
but
ye
are
a
chosen
generation
a
royal
priesthood
an
holy
nation
a
peculiar
people
that
ye
should
shew
forth
the
praises
of
him
who
hath
called
you
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light
which
in
time
past
were
not
a
people
but
are
now
the
people
of
god
which
had
not
obtained
mercy
but
now
have
obtained
mercy
dearly
beloved
i
beseech
you
as
strangers
and
pilgrims
abstain
from
fleshly
lusts
which
war
against
the
soul
having
your
conversation
honest
among
the
gentiles
that
whereas
they
speak
against
you
as
evildoers
they
may
by
your
good
works
which
they
shall
behold
glorify
god
in
the
day
of
visitation
submit
yourselves
to
every
ordinance
of
man
for
the
lord's
sake
whether
it
be
to
the
king
as
supreme
or
unto
governors
as
unto
them
that
are
sent
by
him
for
the
punishment
of
evildoers
and
for
the
praise
of
them
that
do
well
for
so
is
the
will
of
god
that
with
well
doing
ye
may
put
to
silence
the
ignorance
of
foolish
men
as
free
and
not
using
your
liberty
for
a
cloke
of
maliciousness
but
as
the
servants
of
god
honour
all
men
love
the
brotherhood
fear
god
honour
the
king
servants
be
subject
to
your
masters
with
all
fear
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to
the
froward
for
this
is
thankworthy
if
a
man
for
conscience
toward
god
endure
grief
suffering
wrongfully
for
what
glory
is
it
if
when
ye
be
buffeted
for
your
faults
ye
shall
take
it
patiently
but
if
when
ye
do
well
and
suffer
for
it
ye
take
it
patiently
this
is
acceptable
with
god
for
even
hereunto
were
ye
called
because
christ
also
suffered
for
us
leaving
us
an
example
that
ye
should
follow
his
steps
who
did
no
sin
neither
was
guile
found
in
his
mouth
who
when
he
was
reviled
reviled
not
again
when
he
suffered
he
threatened
not
but
committed
himself
to
him
that
judgeth
righteously
who
his
own
self
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
that
we
being
dead
to
sins
should
live
unto
righteousness
by
whose
stripes
ye
were
healed
for
ye
were
as
sheep
going
astray
but
are
now
returned
unto
the
shepherd
and
bishop
of
your
souls
likewise
ye
wives
be
in
subjection
to
your
own
husbands
that
if
any
obey
not
the
word
they
also
may
without
the
word
be
won
by
the
conversation
of
the
wives
while
they
behold
your
chaste
conversation
coupled
with
fear
whose
adorning
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
plaiting
the
hair
and
of
wearing
of
gold
or
of
putting
on
of
apparel
but
let
it
be
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
in
that
which
is
not
corruptible
even
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
in
the
sight
of
god
of
great
price
for
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time
the
holy
women
also
who
trusted
in
god
adorned
themselves
being
in
subjection
unto
their
own
husbands
even
as
sara
obeyed
abraham
calling
him
lord
whose
daughters
ye
are
as
long
as
ye
do
well
and
are
not
afraid
with
any
amazement
likewise
ye
husbands
dwell
with
them
according
to
knowledge
giving
honour
unto
the
wife
as
unto
the
weaker
vessel
and
as
being
heirs
together
of
the
grace
of
life
that
your
prayers
be
not
hindered
finally
be
ye
all
of
one
mind
having
compassion
one
of
another
love
as
brethren
be
pitiful
be
courteous
not
rendering
evil
for
evil
or
railing
for
railing
but
contrariwise
blessing
knowing
that
ye
are
thereunto
called
that
ye
should
inherit
a
blessing
for
he
that
will
love
life
and
see
good
days
let
him
refrain
his
tongue
from
evil
and
his
lips
that
they
speak
no
guile
let
him
eschew
evil
and
do
good
let
him
seek
peace
and
ensue
it
for
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
over
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
prayers
but
the
face
of
the
lord
is
against
them
that
do
evil
and
who
is
he
that
will
harm
you
if
ye
be
followers
of
that
which
is
good
but
and
if
ye
suffer
for
righteousness
sake
happy
are
ye
and
be
not
afraid
of
their
terror
neither
be
troubled
but
sanctify
the
lord
god
in
your
hearts
and
be
ready
always
to
give
an
answer
to
every
man
that
asketh
you
a
reason
of
the
hope
that
is
in
you
with
meekness
and
fear
having
a
good
conscience
that
whereas
they
speak
evil
of
you
as
of
evildoers
they
may
be
ashamed
that
falsely
accuse
your
good
conversation
in
christ
for
it
is
better
if
the
will
of
god
be
so
that
ye
suffer
for
well
doing
than
for
evil
doing
for
christ
also
hath
once
suffered
for
sins
the
just
for
the
unjust
that
he
might
bring
us
to
god
being
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
quickened
by
the
spirit
by
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
which
sometime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
longsuffering
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
while
the
ark
was
a
preparing
wherein
few
that
is
eight
souls
were
saved
by
water
the
like
figure
whereunto
even
baptism
doth
also
now
save
us
not
the
putting
away
of
the
filth
of
the
flesh
but
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
toward
god
by
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
who
is
gone
into
heaven
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
god
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
being
made
subject
unto
him
forasmuch
then
as
christ
hath
suffered
for
us
in
the
flesh
arm
yourselves
likewise
with
the
same
mind
for
he
that
hath
suffered
in
the
flesh
hath
ceased
from
sin
that
he
no
longer
should
live
the
rest
of
his
time
in
the
flesh
to
the
lusts
of
men
but
to
the
will
of
god
for
the
time
past
of
our
life
may
suffice
us
to
have
wrought
the
will
of
the
gentiles
when
we
walked
in
lasciviousness
lusts
excess
of
wine
revellings
banquetings
and
abominable
idolatries
wherein
they
think
it
strange
that
ye
run
not
with
them
to
the
same
excess
of
riot
speaking
evil
of
you
who
shall
give
account
to
him
that
is
ready
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
for
for
this
cause
was
the
gospel
preached
also
to
them
that
are
dead
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
men
in
the
flesh
but
live
according
to
god
in
the
spirit
but
the
end
of
all
things
is
at
hand
be
ye
therefore
sober
and
watch
unto
prayer
and
above
all
things
have
fervent
charity
among
yourselves
for
charity
shall
cover
the
multitude
of
sins
use
hospitality
one
to
another
without
grudging
as
every
man
hath
received
the
gift
even
so
minister
the
same
one
to
another
as
good
stewards
of
the
manifold
grace
of
god
if
any
man
speak
let
him
speak
as
the
oracles
of
god
if
any
man
minister
let
him
do
it
as
of
the
ability
which
god
giveth
that
god
in
all
things
may
be
glorified
through
jesus
christ
to
whom
be
praise
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever
amen
beloved
think
it
not
strange
concerning
the
fiery
trial
which
is
to
try
you
as
though
some
strange
thing
happened
unto
you
but
rejoice
inasmuch
as
ye
are
partakers
of
christ's
sufferings
that
when
his
glory
shall
be
revealed
ye
may
be
glad
also
with
exceeding
joy
if
ye
be
reproached
for
the
name
of
christ
happy
are
ye
for
the
spirit
of
glory
and
of
god
resteth
upon
you
on
their
part
he
is
evil
spoken
of
but
on
your
part
he
is
glorified
but
let
none
of
you
suffer
as
a
murderer
or
as
a
thief
or
as
an
evildoer
or
as
a
busybody
in
other
men's
matters
yet
if
any
man
suffer
as
a
christian
let
him
not
be
ashamed
but
let
him
glorify
god
on
this
behalf
for
the
time
is
come
that
judgment
must
begin
at
the
house
of
god
and
if
it
first
begin
at
us
what
shall
the
end
be
of
them
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
god
and
if
the
righteous
scarcely
be
saved
where
shall
the
ungodly
and
the
sinner
appear
wherefore
let
them
that
suffer
according
to
the
will
of
god
commit
the
keeping
of
their
souls
to
him
in
well
doing
as
unto
a
faithful
creator
the
elders
which
are
among
you
i
exhort
who
am
also
an
elder
and
a
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
also
a
partaker
of
the
glory
that
shall
be
revealed
feed
the
flock
of
god
which
is
among
you
taking
the
oversight
thereof
not
by
constraint
but
willingly
not
for
filthy
lucre
but
of
a
ready
mind
neither
as
being
lords
over
god's
heritage
but
being
ensamples
to
the
flock
and
when
the
chief
shepherd
shall
appear
ye
shall
receive
a
crown
of
glory
that
fadeth
not
away
likewise
ye
younger
submit
yourselves
unto
the
elder
yea
all
of
you
be
subject
one
to
another
and
be
clothed
with
humility
for
god
resisteth
the
proud
and
giveth
grace
to
the
humble
humble
yourselves
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
of
god
that
he
may
exalt
you
in
due
time
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
be
sober
be
vigilant
because
your
adversary
the
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
walketh
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
whom
resist
stedfast
in
the
faith
knowing
that
the
same
afflictions
are
accomplished
in
your
brethren
that
are
in
the
world
but
the
god
of
all
grace
who
hath
called
us
unto
his
eternal
glory
by
christ
jesus
after
that
ye
have
suffered
a
while

you
perfect

settle
you
to
him
be
glory
and
dominion
for
ever
and
ever
amen
by
silvanus
a
faithful
brother
unto
you
as
i
suppose
i
have
written
briefly
exhorting
and
testifying
that
this
is
the
true
grace
of
god
wherein
ye
stand
the
church
that
is
at
babylon
elected
together
with
you
saluteth
you
and
so
doth
marcus
my
son
greet
ye
one
another
with
a
kiss
of
charity
peace
be
with
you
all
that
are
in
christ
jesus
amen
the
second
general
epistle
of
peter
simon
peter
a
servant
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
righteousness
of
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
grace
and
peace
be
multiplied
unto
you
through
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
jesus
our
lord
according
as
his
divine
power
hath
given
unto
us
all
things
that
pertain
unto
life
and
godliness
through
the
knowledge
of
him
that
hath
called
us
to
glory
and
virtue
whereby
are
given
unto
us
exceeding
great
and
precious
promises
that
by
these
ye
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
nature
having
escaped
the
corruption
that
is
in
the
world
through
lust
and
beside
this
giving
all
diligence
add
to
your
faith
virtue
and
to
virtue
knowledge
and
to
knowledge
temperance
and
to
temperance
patience
and
to
patience
godliness
and
to
godliness
brotherly
kindness
and
to
brotherly
kindness
charity
for
if
these
things
be
in
you
and
abound
they
make
you
that
ye
shall
neither
be
barren
nor
unfruitful
in
the
knowledge
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
but
he
that
lacketh
these
things
is
blind
and
cannot
see
afar
off
and
hath
forgotten
that
he
was
purged
from
his
old
sins
wherefore
the
rather
brethren
give
diligence
to
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
for
if
ye
do
these
things
ye
shall
never
fall
for
so
an
entrance
shall
be
ministered
unto
you
abundantly
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
wherefore
i
will
not
be
negligent
to
put
you
always
in
remembrance
of
these
things
though
ye
know
them
and
be
established
in
the
present
truth
yea
i
think
it
meet
as
long
as
i
am
in
this
tabernacle
to
stir
you
up
by
putting
you
in
remembrance
knowing
that
shortly
i
must
put
off
this
my
tabernacle
even
as
our
lord
jesus
christ
hath
shewed
me
moreover
i
will
endeavour
that
ye
may
be
able
after
my
decease
to
have
these
things
always
in
remembrance
for
we
have
not
followed
cunningly
devised
fables
when
we
made
known
unto
you
the
power
and
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
but
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
majesty
for
he
received
from
god
the
father
honour
and
glory
when
there
came
such
a
voice
to
him
from
the
excellent
glory
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
and
this
voice
which
came
from
heaven
we
heard
when
we
were
with
him
in
the
holy
mount
we
have
also
a
more
sure
word
of
prophecy
whereunto
ye
do
well
that
ye
take
heed
as
unto
a
light
that
shineth
in
a
dark
place
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
day
star
arise
in
your
hearts
knowing
this
first
that
no
prophecy
of
the
scripture
is
of
any
private
interpretation
for
the
prophecy
came
not
in
old
time
by
the
will
of
man
but
holy
men
of
god
spake
as
they
were
moved
by
the
holy
ghost
but
there
were
false
prophets
also
among
the
people
even
as
there
shall
be
false
teachers
among
you
who
privily
shall
bring
in
damnable
heresies
even
denying
the
lord
that
bought
them
and
bring
upon
themselves
swift
destruction
and
many
shall
follow
their
pernicious
ways
by
reason
of
whom
the
way
of
truth
shall
be
evil
spoken
of
and
through
covetousness
shall
they
with
feigned
words
make
merchandise
of
you
whose
judgment
now
of
a
long
time
lingereth
not
and
their
damnation
slumbereth
not
for
if
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment
and
spared
not
the
old
world
but
saved
noah
the
eighth
person
a
preacher
of
righteousness
bringing
in
the
flood
upon
the
world
of
the
ungodly
and
turning
the
cities
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
into
ashes
condemned
them
with
an
overthrow
making
them
an
ensample
unto
those
that
after
should
live
ungodly
and
delivered
just
lot
vexed
with
the
filthy
conversation
of
the
wicked
for
that
righteous
man
dwelling
among
them
in
seeing
and
hearing
vexed
his
righteous
soul
from
day
to
day
with
their
unlawful
deeds
the
lord
knoweth
how
to
deliver
the
godly
out
of
temptations
and
to
reserve
the
unjust
unto
the
day
of
judgment
to
be
punished
but
chiefly
them
that
walk
after
the
flesh
in
the
lust
of
uncleanness
and
despise
government
presumptuous
are
they
selfwilled
they
are
not
afraid
to
speak
evil
of
dignities
whereas
angels
which
are
greater
in
power
and
might
bring
not
railing
accusation
against
them
before
the
lord
but
these
as
natural
brute
beasts
made
to
be
taken
and
destroyed
speak
evil
of
the
things
that
they
understand
not
and
shall
utterly
perish
in
their
own
corruption
and
shall
receive
the
reward
of
unrighteousness
as
they
that
count
it
pleasure
to
riot
in
the
day
time
spots
they
are
and
blemishes
sporting
themselves
with
their
own
deceivings
while
they
feast
with
you
having
eyes
full
of
adultery
and
that
cannot
cease
from
sin
beguiling
unstable
souls
an
heart
they
have
exercised
with
covetous
practices
cursed
children
which
have
forsaken
the
right
way
and
are
gone
astray
following
the
way
of
balaam
the
son
of
bosor
who
loved
the
wages
of
unrighteousness
but
was
rebuked
for
his
iniquity
the
dumb
ass
speaking
with
man's
voice
forbad
the
madness
of
the
prophet
these
are
wells
without
water
clouds
that
are
carried
with
a
tempest
to
whom
the
mist
of
darkness
is
reserved
for
ever
for
when
they
speak
great
swelling
words
of
vanity
they
allure
through
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
through
much
wantonness
those
that
were
clean
escaped
from
them
who
live
in
error
while
they
promise
them
liberty
they
themselves
are
the
servants
of
corruption
for
of
whom
a
man
is
overcome
of
the
same
is
he
brought
in
bondage
for
if
after
they
have
escaped
the
pollutions
of
the
world
through
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
they
are
again
entangled
therein
and
overcome
the
latter
end
is
worse
with
them
than
the
beginning
for
it
had
been
better
for
them
not
to
have
known
the
way
of
righteousness
than
after
they
have
known
it
to
turn
from
the
holy
commandment
delivered
unto
them
but
it
is
happened
unto
them
according
to
the
true
proverb
the
dog
is
turned
to
his
own
vomit
again
and
the
sow
that
was
washed
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire
this
second
epistle
beloved
i
now
write
unto
you
in
both
which
i
stir
up
your
pure
minds
by
way
of
remembrance
that
ye
may
be
mindful
of
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
by
the
holy
prophets
and
of
the
commandment
of
us
the
apostles
of
the
lord
and
saviour
knowing
this
first
that
there
shall
come
in
the
last
days
scoffers
walking
after
their
own
lusts
and
saying
where
is
the
promise
of
his
coming
for
since
the
fathers
fell
asleep
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
for
this
they
willingly
are
ignorant
of
that
by
the
word
of
god
the
heavens
were
of
old
and
the
earth
standing
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
water
whereby
the
world
that
then
was
being
overflowed
with
water
perished
but
the
heavens
and
the
earth
which
are
now
by
the
same
word
are
kept
in
store
reserved
unto
fire
against
the
day
of
judgment
and
perdition
of
ungodly
men
but
beloved
be
not
ignorant
of
this
one
thing
that
one
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
the
lord
is
not
slack
concerning
his
promise
as
some
men
count
slackness
but
is
longsuffering
to
us-ward
not
willing
that
any
should
perish
but
that
all
should
come
to
repentance
but
the
day
of
the
lord
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
night
in
the
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
noise
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
up
seeing
then
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved
what
manner
of
persons
ought
ye
to
be
in
all
holy
conversation
and
godliness
looking
for
and
hasting
unto
the
coming
of
the
day
of
god
wherein
the
heavens
being
on
fire
shall
be
dissolved
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
nevertheless
we
according
to
his
promise
look
for
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
wherefore
beloved
seeing
that
ye
look
for
such
things
be
diligent
that
ye
may
be
found
of
him
in
peace
without
spot
and
blameless
and
account
that
the
longsuffering
of
our
lord
is
salvation
even
as
our
beloved
brother
paul
also
according
to
the
wisdom
given
unto
him
hath
written
unto
you
as
also
in
all
his
epistles
speaking
in
them
of
these
things
in
which
are
some
things
hard
to
be
understood
which
they
that
are
unlearned
and
unstable
wrest
as
they
do
also
the
other
scriptures
unto
their
own
destruction
ye
therefore
beloved
seeing
ye
know
these
things
before
beware
lest
ye
also
being
led
away
with
the
error
of
the
wicked
fall
from
your
own
stedfastness
but
grow
in
grace
and
in
the
knowledge
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
to
him
be
glory
both
now
and
for
ever
amen
the
first
epistle
general
of
john
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes
which
we
have
looked
upon
and
our
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
life
for
the
life
was
manifested
and
we
have
seen
it
and
bear
witness
and
shew
unto
you
that
eternal
life
which
was
with
the
father
and
was
manifested
unto
us
that
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
declare
we
unto
you
that
ye
also
may
have
fellowship
with
us
and
truly
our
fellowship
is
with
the
father
and
with
his
son
jesus
christ
and
these
things
write
we
unto
you
that
your
joy
may
be
full
this
then
is
the
message
which
we
have
heard
of
him
and
declare
unto
you
that
god
is
light
and
in
him
is
no
darkness
at
all
if
we
say
that
we
have
fellowship
with
him
and
walk
in
darkness
we
lie
and
do
not
the
truth
but
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
one
with
another
and
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
if
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
if
we
say
that
we
have
not
sinned
we
make
him
a
liar
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
my
little
children
these
things
write
i
unto
you
that
ye
sin
not
and
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
jesus
christ
the
righteous
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
and
not
for
our's
only
but
also
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
and
hereby
we
do
know
that
we
know
him
if
we
keep
his
commandments
he
that
saith
i
know
him
and
keepeth
not
his
commandments
is
a
liar
and
the
truth
is
not
in
him
but
whoso
keepeth
his
word
in
him
verily
is
the
love
of
god
perfected
hereby
know
we
that
we
are
in
him
he
that
saith
he
abideth
in
him
ought
himself
also
so
to
walk
even
as
he
walked
brethren
i
write
no
new
commandment
unto
you
but
an
old
commandment
which
ye
had
from
the
beginning
the
old
commandment
is
the
word
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
again
a
new
commandment
i
write
unto
you
which
thing
is
true
in
him
and
in
you
because
the
darkness
is
past
and
the
true
light
now
shineth
he
that
saith
he
is
in
the
light
and
hateth
his
brother
is
in
darkness
even
until
now
he
that
loveth
his
brother
abideth
in
the
light
and
there
is
none
occasion
of
stumbling
in
him
but
he
that
hateth
his
brother
is
in
darkness
and
walketh
in
darkness
and
knoweth
not
whither
he
goeth
because
that
darkness
hath
blinded
his
eyes
i
write
unto
you
little
children
because
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
for
his
name's
sake
i
write
unto
you
fathers
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning
i
write
unto
you
young
men
because
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one
i
write
unto
you
little
children
because
ye
have
known
the
father
i
have
written
unto
you
fathers
because
ye
have
known
him
that
is
from
the
beginning
i
have
written
unto
you
young
men
because
ye
are
strong
and
the
word
of
god
abideth
in
you
and
ye
have
overcome
the
wicked
one
love
not
the
world
neither
the
things
that
are
in
the
world
if
any
man
love
the
world
the
love
of
the
father
is
not
in
him
for
all
that
is
in
the
world
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
lust
of
the
eyes
and
the
pride
of
life
is
not
of
the
father
but
is
of
the
world
and
the
world
passeth
away
and
the
lust
thereof
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
god
abideth
for
ever
little
children
it
is
the
last
time
and
as
ye
have
heard
that
antichrist
shall
come
even
now
are
there
many
antichrists
whereby
we
know
that
it
is
the
last
time
they
went
out
from
us
but
they
were
not
of
us
for
if
they
had
been
of
us
they
would
no
doubt
have
continued
with
us
but
they
went
out
that
they
might
be
made
manifest
that
they
were
not
all
of
us
but
ye
have
an
unction
from
the
holy
one
and
ye
know
all
things
i
have
not
written
unto
you
because
ye
know
not
the
truth
but
because
ye
know
it
and
that
no
lie
is
of
the
truth
who
is
a
liar
but
he
that
denieth
that
jesus
is
the
christ
he
is
antichrist
that
denieth
the
father
and
the
son
whosoever
denieth
the
son
the
same
hath
not
the
father
he
that
acknowledgeth
the
son
hath
the
father
also
let
that
therefore
abide
in
you
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
if
that
which
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
shall
remain
in
you
ye
also
shall
continue
in
the
son
and
in
the
father
and
this
is
the
promise
that
he
hath
promised
us
even
eternal
life
these
things
have
i
written
unto
you
concerning
them
that
seduce
you
but
the
anointing
which
ye
have
received
of
him
abideth
in
you
and
ye
need
not
that
any
man
teach
you
but
as
the
same
anointing
teacheth
you
of
all
things
and
is
truth
and
is
no
lie
and
even
as
it
hath
taught
you
ye
shall
abide
in
him
and
now
little
children
abide
in
him
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
may
have
confidence
and
not
be
ashamed
before
him
at
his
coming
if
ye
know
that
he
is
righteous
ye
know
that
every
one
that
doeth
righteousness
is
born
of
him
behold
what
manner
of
love
the
father
hath
bestowed
upon
us
that
we
should
be
called
the
sons
of
god
therefore
the
world
knoweth
us
not
because
it
knew
him
not
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
and
every
man
that
hath
this
hope
in
him
purifieth
himself
even
as
he
is
pure
whosoever
committeth
sin
transgresseth
also
the
law
for
sin
is
the
transgression
of
the
law
and
ye
know
that
he
was
manifested
to
take
away
our
sins
and
in
him
is
no
sin
whosoever
abideth
in
him
sinneth
not
whosoever
sinneth
hath
not
seen
him
neither
known
him
little
children
let
no
man
deceive
you
he
that
doeth
righteousness
is
righteous
even
as
he
is
righteous
he
that
committeth
sin
is
of
the
devil
for
the
devil
sinneth
from
the
beginning
for
this
purpose
the
son
of
god
was
manifested
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
whosoever
is
born
of
god
doth
not
commit
sin
for
his
seed
remaineth
in
him
and
he
cannot
sin
because
he
is
born
of
god
in
this
the
children
of
god
are
manifest
and
the
children
of
the
devil
whosoever
doeth
not
righteousness
is
not
of
god
neither
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
for
this
is
the
message
that
ye
heard
from
the
beginning
that
we
should
love
one
another
not
as
cain
who
was
of
that
wicked
one
and
slew
his
brother
and
wherefore
slew
he
him
because
his
own
works
were
evil
and
his
brother's
righteous
marvel
not
my
brethren
if
the
world
hate
you
we
know
that
we
have
passed
from
death
unto
life
because
we
love
the
brethren
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
abideth
in
death
whosoever
hateth
his
brother
is
a
murderer
and
ye
know
that
no
murderer
hath
eternal
life
abiding
in
him
hereby
perceive
we
the
love
of
god
because
he
laid
down
his
life
for
us
and
we
ought
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
brethren
but
whoso
hath
this
world's
good
and
seeth
his
brother
have
need
and
shutteth
up
his
bowels
of
compassion
from
him
how
dwelleth
the
love
of
god
in
him
my
little
children
let
us
not
love
in
word
neither
in
tongue
but
in
deed
and
in
truth
and
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth
and
shall
assure
our
hearts
before
him
for
if
our
heart
condemn
us
god
is
greater
than
our
heart
and
knoweth
all
things
beloved
if
our
heart
condemn
us
not
then
have
we
confidence
toward
god
and
whatsoever
we
ask
we
receive
of
him
because
we
keep
his
commandments
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
and
this
is
his
commandment
that
we
should
believe
on
the
name
of
his
son
jesus
christ
and
love
one
another
as
he
gave
us
commandment
and
he
that
keepeth
his
commandments
dwelleth
in
him
and
he
in
him
and
hereby
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
by
the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
us
beloved
believe
not
every
spirit
but
try
the
spirits
whether
they
are
of
god
because
many
false
prophets
are
gone
out
into
the
world
hereby
know
ye
the
spirit
of
god
every
spirit
that
confesseth
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
of
god
and
every
spirit
that
confesseth
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
not
of
god
and
this
is
that
spirit
of
antichrist
whereof
ye
have
heard
that
it
should
come
and
even
now
already
is
it
in
the
world
ye
are
of
god
little
children
and
have
overcome
them
because
greater
is
he
that
is
in
you
than
he
that
is
in
the
world
they
are
of
the
world
therefore
speak
they
of
the
world
and
the
world
heareth
them
we
are
of
god
he
that
knoweth
god
heareth
us
he
that
is
not
of
god
heareth
not
us
hereby
know
we
the
spirit
of
truth
and
the
spirit
of
error
beloved
let
us
love
one
another
for
love
is
of
god
and
every
one
that
loveth
is
born
of
god
and
knoweth
god
he
that
loveth
not
knoweth
not
god
for
god
is
love
in
this
was
manifested
the
love
of
god
toward
us
because
that
god
sent
his
only
begotten
son
into
the
world
that
we
might
live
through
him
herein
is
love
not
that
we
loved
god
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
beloved
if
god
so
loved
us
we
ought
also
to
love
one
another
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
if
we
love
one
another
god
dwelleth
in
us
and
his
love
is
perfected
in
us
hereby
know
we
that
we
dwell
in
him
and
he
in
us
because
he
hath
given
us
of
his
spirit
and
we
have
seen
and
do
testify
that
the
father
sent
the
son
to
be
the
saviour
of
the
world
whosoever
shall
confess
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
god
dwelleth
in
him
and
he
in
god
and
we
have
known
and
believed
the
love
that
god
hath
to
us
god
is
love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
god
and
god
in
him
herein
is
our
love
made
perfect
that
we
may
have
boldness
in
the
day
of
judgment
because
as
he
is
so
are
we
in
this
world
there
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
because
fear
hath
torment
he
that
feareth
is
not
made
perfect
in
love
we
love
him
because
he
first
loved
us
if
a
man
say
i
love
god
and
hateth
his
brother
he
is
a
liar
for
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
can
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
and
this
commandment
have
we
from
him
that
he
who
loveth
god
love
his
brother
also
whosoever
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
christ
is
born
of
god
and
every
one
that
loveth
him
that
begat
loveth
him
also
that
is
begotten
of
him
by
this
we
know
that
we
love
the
children
of
god
when
we
love
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
love
of
god
that
we
keep
his
commandments
and
his
commandments
are
not
grievous
for
whatsoever
is
born
of
god
overcometh
the
world
and
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
even
our
faith
who
is
he
that
overcometh
the
world
but
he
that
believeth
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
this
is
he
that
came
by
water
and
blood
even
jesus
christ
not
by
water
only
but
by
water
and
blood
and
it
is
the
spirit
that
beareth
witness
because
the
spirit
is
truth
for
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
heaven
the
father
the
word
and
the
holy
ghost
and
these
three
are
one
and
there
are
three
that
bear
witness
in
earth
the
spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
these
three
agree
in
one
if
we
receive
the
witness
of
men
the
witness
of
god
is
greater
for
this
is
the
witness
of
god
which
he
hath
testified
of
his
son
he
that
believeth
on
the
son
of
god
hath
the
witness
in
himself
he
that
believeth
not
god
hath
made
him
a
liar
because
he
believeth
not
the
record
that
god
gave
of
his
son
and
this
is
the
record
that
god
hath
given
to
us
eternal
life
and
this
life
is
in
his
son
he
that
hath
the
son
hath
life
and
he
that
hath
not
the
son
of
god
hath
not
life
these
things
have
i
written
unto
you
that
believe
on
the
name
of
the
son
of
god
that
ye
may
know
that
ye
have
eternal
life
and
that
ye
may
believe
on
the
name
of
the
son
of
god
and
this
is
the
confidence
that
we
have
in
him
that
if
we
ask
any
thing
according
to
his
will
he
heareth
us
and
if
we
know
that
he
hear
us
whatsoever
we
ask
we
know
that
we
have
the
petitions
that
we
desired
of
him
if
any
man
see
his
brother
sin
a
sin
which
is
not
unto
death
he
shall
ask
and
he
shall
give
him
life
for
them
that
sin
not
unto
death
there
is
a
sin
unto
death
i
do
not
say
that
he
shall
pray
for
it
all
unrighteousness
is
sin
and
there
is
a
sin
not
unto
death
we
know
that
whosoever
is
born
of
god
sinneth
not
but
he
that
is
begotten
of
god
keepeth
himself
and
that
wicked
one
toucheth
him
not
and
we
know
that
we
are
of
god
and
the
whole
world
lieth
in
wickedness
and
we
know
that
the
son
of
god
is
come
and
hath
given
us
an
understanding
that
we
may
know
him
that
is
true
and
we
are
in
him
that
is
true
even
in
his
son
jesus
christ
this
is
the
true
god
and
eternal
life
little
children
keep
yourselves
from
idols
amen
the
second
epistle
general
of
john
the
elder
unto
the
elect
lady
and
her
children
whom
i
love
in
the
truth
and
not
i
only
but
also
all
they
that
have
known
the
truth
for
the
truth's
sake
which
dwelleth
in
us
and
shall
be
with
us
for
ever
grace
be
with
you
mercy
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
from
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
son
of
the
father
in
truth
and
love
i
rejoiced
greatly
that
i
found
of
thy
children
walking
in
truth
as
we
have
received
a
commandment
from
the
father
and
now
i
beseech
thee
lady
not
as
though
i
wrote
a
new
commandment
unto
thee
but
that
which
we
had
from
the
beginning
that
we
love
one
another
and
this
is
love
that
we
walk
after
his
commandments
this
is
the
commandment
that
as
ye
have
heard
from
the
beginning
ye
should
walk
in
it
for
many
deceivers
are
entered
into
the
world
who
confess
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
this
is
a
deceiver
and
an
antichrist
look
to
yourselves
that
we
lose
not
those
things
which
we
have
wrought
but
that
we
receive
a
full
reward
whosoever
transgresseth
and
abideth
not
in
the
doctrine
of
christ
hath
not
god
he
that
abideth
in
the
doctrine
of
christ
he
hath
both
the
father
and
the
son
if
there
come
any
unto
you
and
bring
not
this
doctrine
receive
him
not
into
your
house
neither
bid
him
god
speed
for
he
that
biddeth
him
god
speed
is
partaker
of
his
evil
deeds
having
many
things
to
write
unto
you
i
would
not
write
with
paper
and
ink
but
i
trust
to
come
unto
you
and
speak
face
to
face
that
our
joy
may
be
full
the
children
of
thy
elect
sister
greet
thee
amen
the
third
epistle
general
of
john
the
elder
unto
the
wellbeloved
gaius
whom
i
love
in
the
truth
beloved
i
wish
above
all
things
that
thou
mayest
prosper
and
be
in
health
even
as
thy
soul
prospereth
for
i
rejoiced
greatly
when
the
brethren
came
and
testified
of
the
truth
that
is
in
thee
even
as
thou
walkest
in
the
truth
i
have
no
greater
joy
than
to
hear
that
my
children
walk
in
truth
beloved
thou
doest
faithfully
whatsoever
thou
doest
to
the
brethren
and
to
strangers
which
have
borne
witness
of
thy
charity
before
the
church
whom
if
thou
bring
forward
on
their
journey
after
a
godly
sort
thou
shalt
do
well
because
that
for
his
name's
sake
they
went
forth
taking
nothing
of
the
gentiles
we
therefore
ought
to
receive
such
that
we
might
be
fellowhelpers
to
the
truth
i
wrote
unto
the
church
but
diotrephes
who
loveth
to
have
the
preeminence
among
them
receiveth
us
not
wherefore
if
i
come
i
will
remember
his
deeds
which
he
doeth
prating
against
us
with
malicious
words
and
not
content
therewith
neither
doth
he
himself
receive
the
brethren
and
forbiddeth
them
that
would
and
casteth
them
out
of
the
church
beloved
follow
not
that
which
is
evil
but
that
which
is
good
he
that
doeth
good
is
of
god
but
he
that
doeth
evil
hath
not
seen
god
demetrius
hath
good
report
of
all
men
and
of
the
truth
itself
yea
and
we
also
bear
record
and
ye
know
that
our
record
is
true
i
had
many
things
to
write
but
i
will
not
with
ink
and
pen
write
unto
thee
but
i
trust
i
shall
shortly
see
thee
and
we
shall
speak
face
to
face
peace
be
to
thee
our
friends
salute
thee
greet
the
friends
by
name
the
general
epistle
of
jude
jude
the
servant
of
jesus
christ
and
brother
of
james
to
them
that
are
sanctified
by
god
the
father
and
preserved
in
jesus
christ
and
called
mercy
unto
you
and
peace
and
love
be
multiplied
beloved
when
i
gave
all
diligence
to
write
unto
you
of
the
common
salvation
it
was
needful
for
me
to
write
unto
you
and
exhort
you
that
ye
should
earnestly
contend
for
the
faith
which
was
once
delivered
unto
the
saints
for
there
are
certain
men
crept
in
unawares
who
were
before
of
old
ordained
to
this
condemnation
ungodly
men
turning
the
grace
of
our
god
into
lasciviousness
and
denying
the
only
lord
god
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
i
will
therefore
put
you
in
remembrance
though
ye
once
knew
this
how
that
the
lord
having
saved
the
people
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
afterward
destroyed
them
that
believed
not
and
the
angels
which
kept
not
their
first
estate
but
left
their
own
habitation
he
hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
even
as
sodom
and
gomorrha
and
the
cities
about
them
in
like
manner
giving
themselves
over
to
fornication
and
going
after
strange
flesh
are
set
forth
for
an
example
suffering
the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire
likewise
also
these
filthy
dreamers
defile
the
flesh
despise
dominion
and
speak
evil
of
dignities
yet
michael
the
archangel
when
contending
with
the
devil
he
disputed
about
the
body
of
moses
durst
not
bring
against
him
a
railing
accusation
but
said
the
lord
rebuke
thee
but
these
speak
evil
of
those
things
which
they
know
not
but
what
they
know
naturally
as
brute
beasts
in
those
things
they
corrupt
themselves
woe
unto
them
for
they
have
gone
in
the
way
of
cain
and
ran
greedily
after
the
error
of
balaam
for
reward
and
perished
in
the
gainsaying
of
core
these
are
spots
in
your
feasts
of
charity
when
they
feast
with
you
feeding
themselves
without
fear
clouds
they
are
without
water
carried
about
of
winds
trees
whose
fruit
withereth
without
fruit
twice
dead
plucked
up
by
the
roots
raging
waves
of
the
sea
foaming
out
their
own
shame
wandering
stars
to
whom
is
reserved
the
blackness
of
darkness
for
ever
and
enoch
also
the
seventh
from
adam
prophesied
of
these
saying
behold
the
lord
cometh
with
ten
thousands
of
his
saints
to
execute
judgment
upon
all
and
to
convince
all
that
are
ungodly
among
them
of
all
their
ungodly
deeds
which
they
have
ungodly
committed
and
of
all
their
hard
speeches
which
ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
him
these
are
murmurers
complainers
walking
after
their
own
lusts
and
their
mouth
speaketh
great
swelling
words
having
men's
persons
in
admiration
because
of
advantage
but
beloved
remember
ye
the
words
which
were
spoken
before
of
the
apostles
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
how
that
they
told
you
there
should
be
mockers
in
the
last
time
who
should
walk
after
their
own
ungodly
lusts
these
be
they
who
separate
themselves
sensual
having
not
the
spirit
but
ye
beloved
building
up
yourselves
on
your
most
holy
faith
praying
in
the
holy
ghost
keep
yourselves
in
the
love
of
god
looking
for
the
mercy
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
unto
eternal
life
and
of
some
have
compassion
making
a
difference
and
others
save
with
fear
pulling
them
out
of
the
fire
hating
even
the
garment
spotted
by
the
flesh
now
unto
him
that
is
able
to
keep
you
from
falling
and
to
present
you
faultless
before
the
presence
of
his
glory
with
exceeding
joy
to
the
only
wise
god
our
saviour
be
glory
and
majesty
dominion
and
power
both
now
and
ever
amen
the
revelation
of

revelation
of
jesus
christ
which
god
gave
unto
him
to
shew
unto
his
servants

must
shortly
come
to
pass
and

sent
and
signified
it
by
his
angel

was
and
which
is
to
come

who
is
the
faithful
witness
and
the
first
begotten
of
the
dead
and
the
prince
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
unto
him
that
loved
us
and
washed
us
from
our
sins
in
his
own
blood
and
hath
made
us
kings
and
priests
unto

shall
wail
because
of
him
even
so
amen
i
am
alpha

the
beginning
and
the
ending
saith
the
lord
which
is
and
which
was
and
which
is
to
come
the
almighty
i
john
who
also
am
your
brother
and
companion
in
tribulation
and
in
the
kingdom
and
patience
of
jesus
christ
was
in
the
isle
that
is
called
patmos
for
the
word
of
god
and
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
i
was
in
the
spirit
on
the
lord's
day
and
heard
behind
me
a
great
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
saying
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
first
and
the
last
and
what
thou
seest
write
in
a
book
and
send
it
unto
the
seven
churches
which
are
in
asia
unto
ephesus
and
unto
smyrna
and
unto
pergamos
and
unto
thyatira
and
unto
sardis
and
unto
philadelphia
and
unto
laodicea
and
i
turned
to
see
the
voice
that
spake
with
me
and
being
turned
i
saw
seven
golden
candlesticks
and
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
candlesticks
one
like
unto
the
son
of
man
clothed
with
a
garment
down
to
the
foot
and
girt
about
the
paps
with
a
golden
girdle
his
head
and
his
hairs
were
white
like
wool
as
white
as
snow
and
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
his
feet
like
unto
fine
brass
as
if
they
burned
in
a
furnace
and
his
voice
as
the
sound
of
many
waters
and
he
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
and
out
of
his
mouth
went
a
sharp
twoedged
sword
and
his
countenance
was
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
strength

where
satan's
seat
is
and
thou
holdest
fast
my
name
and
hast
not
denied
my
faith
even
in
those
days
wherein
antipas
was
my
faithful
martyr
who
was
slain
among
you
where
satan
dwelleth
but
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
hast
there
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
balaam
who
taught
balac
to
cast
a
stumblingblock
before
the
children
of
israel
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
and
to
commit
fornication

also
them

the
doctrine
of

nicolaitanes

thing
i
hate
repent

else
i
will
come
unto
thee

spirit
saith
unto
the

to
him
that

will
i
give
to
eat
of
the
hidden
manna
and
will
give
him
a
white
stone
and
in
the
stone
a
new
name
written
which
no
man
knoweth
saving
he
that
receiveth
it
and
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
thyatira
write
these
things
saith
the
son
of
god
who
hath
his
eyes
like
unto
a
flame
of
fire
and
his
feet
are
like
fine
brass
i
know
thy
works
and
charity
and
service
and
faith
and
thy
patience
and
thy
works
and
the
last
to
be
more
than
the
first
notwithstanding
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
sufferest
that
woman
jezebel
which
calleth
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
to
seduce
my
servants
to
commit
fornication
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
and
i
gave
her
space
to
repent
of
her
fornication
and
she
repented
not
behold
i
will
cast
her
into
a
bed
and
them
that
commit
adultery
with
her
into
great
tribulation
except
they
repent
of
their
deeds
and
i
will
kill
her
children
with
death
and
all
the
churches
shall
know
that
i
am
he
which
searcheth
the
reins
and
hearts
and
i
will
give
unto
every
one
of
you
according
to
your
works
but
unto
you
i
say
and
unto
the
rest
in
thyatira
as
many
as
have
not
this
doctrine
and
which
have
not
known
the
depths
of
satan
as
they
speak
i
will
put
upon
you
none
other
burden
but
that
which
ye
have
already
hold
fast
till
i
come
and
he
that
overcometh
and
keepeth
my
works
unto
the
end
to
him
will
i
give
power
over
the
nations
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
as
the
vessels
of
a
potter
shall
they
be
broken
to
shivers
even
as

received
of

received
and

fast
and

if
therefore
thou
shalt
not

come
on
thee
as
a

what
hour
i
will
come

father
in
his
throne
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
after
this
i
looked
and
behold
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
which
i
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me
which
said
come
up
hither
and
i
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter
and
immediately
i
was
in
the
spirit
and
behold
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven
and
one
sat
on
the
throne
and
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats
and
upon
the
seats
i
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold
and
out
of
the
throne
proceeded
lightnings
and
thunderings
and
voices
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
throne
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
and
before
the
throne
there
was
a
sea
of
glass
like
unto
crystal
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
behind
and
the
first
beast
was
like
a
lion
and
the
second
beast
like
a
calf
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
man
and
the
fourth
beast
was
like
a
flying
eagle
and
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
him
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
within
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night
saying
holy
holy
holy
lord
god
almighty
which
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
and
when
those
beasts
give
glory
and
honour
and
thanks
to
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fall
down
before
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
and
worship
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
cast
their
crowns
before
the
throne
saying
thou
art
worthy
o
lord
to
receive
glory
and
honour
and
power
for
thou
hast
created
all
things
and
for
thy
pleasure
they
are
and
were
created
and
i
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
a
book
written
within
and
on
the
backside
sealed
with
seven
seals
and
i
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
voice
who
is
worthy
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seals
thereof
and
no
man
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
neither
under
the
earth
was
able
to
open
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
and
i
wept
much
because
no
man
was
found
worthy
to
open
and
to
read
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
and
one
of
the
elders
saith
unto
me
weep
not
behold
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
juda
the
root
of
david
hath
prevailed
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
thereof
and
i
beheld
and
lo
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
beasts
and
in
the
midst
of
the
elders
stood
a
lamb
as
it
had
been
slain
having
seven
horns
and
seven
eyes
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
sent
forth
into
all
the
earth
and
he
came
and
took
the
book
out
of
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
throne
and
when
he
had
taken
the
book
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
every
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odours
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints
and
they
sung
a
new
song
saying
thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
book
and
to
open
the
seals
thereof
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
hast
made
us
unto
our
god
kings
and
priests
and
we
shall
reign
on
the
earth
and
i
beheld
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
elders
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
saying
with
a
loud
voice
worthy
is
the
lamb
that
was
slain
to
receive
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honour
and
glory
and
blessing
and
every
creature
which
is
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
such
as
are
in
the
sea
and
all
that
are
in
them
heard
i
saying
blessing
and
honour
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
beasts
said
amen
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
i
saw
when
the
lamb
opened
one
of
the
seals
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
noise
of
thunder
one
of
the
four
beasts
saying
come
and
see
and
i
saw
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
bow
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
him
and
he
went
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
and
when
he
had
opened
the
second
seal
i
heard
the
second
beast
say
come
and
see
and
there
went
out
another
horse
that
was
red
and
power
was
given
to
him
that
sat
thereon
to
take
peace
from
the
earth
and
that
they
should
kill
one
another
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
great
sword
and
when
he
had
opened
the
third
seal
i
heard
the
third
beast
say
come
and
see
and
i
beheld
and
lo
a
black
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
pair
of
balances
in
his
hand
and
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
beasts
say
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
wine
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fourth
seal
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
beast
say
come
and
see
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
pale
horse
and
his
name
that
sat
on
him
was
death
and
hell
followed
with
him
and
power
was
given
unto
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth
to
kill
with
sword
and
with
hunger
and
with
death
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fifth
seal
i
saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of
them
that
were
slain
for
the
word
of
god
and
for
the
testimony
which
they
held
and
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
how
long
o
lord
holy
and
true
dost
thou
not
judge
and
avenge
our
blood
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
them
and
it
was
said
unto
them
that
they
should
rest
yet
for
a
little
season
until
their
fellowservants
also
and
their
brethren
that
should
be
killed
as
they
were
should
be
fulfilled
and
i
beheld
when
he
had
opened
the
sixth
seal
and
lo
there
was
a
great
earthquake
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of
hair
and
the
moon
became
as
blood
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
unto
the
earth
even
as
a
fig
tree
casteth
her
untimely
figs
when
she
is
shaken
of
a
mighty
wind
and
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
when
it
is
rolled
together
and
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
places
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
the
great
men
and
the
rich
men
and
the
chief
captains
and
the
mighty
men
and
every
bondman
and
every
free
man
hid
themselves
in
the
dens
and
in
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
and
said
to
the
mountains
and
rocks
fall
on
us
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
lamb
for
the
great
day
of
his
wrath
is
come
and
who
shall
be
able
to
stand
and
after
these
things
i
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
earth
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
and
i
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
east
having
the
seal
of
the
living
god
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
sea
saying
hurt
not
the
earth
neither
the
sea
nor
the
trees
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
god
in
their
foreheads
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
sealed
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
of
all

after
this
i
beheld
and
lo
a
great
multitude
which
no
man
could
number
of
all
nations
and
kindreds
and
people
and
tongues
stood
before
the
throne
and
before
the
lamb
clothed
with
white
robes
and
palms
in
their
hands
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
salvation
to
our
god
which
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
and
all
the
angels
stood
round
about
the
throne
and
about
the
elders
and
the
four
beasts
and
fell
before
the
throne
on
their
faces
and
worshipped
god
saying
amen
blessing
and
glory
and
wisdom
and
thanksgiving
and
honour
and
power
and
might
be
unto
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
amen
and
one
of
the
elders
answered
saying
unto
me
what
are
these
which
are
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
whence
came
they
and
i
said
unto
him
sir
thou
knowest
and
he
said
to
me
these
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
therefore
are
they
before
the
throne
of
god
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
they
shall
hunger
no
more
neither
thirst
any
more
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
for
the
lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
when
he
had
opened
the
seventh
seal
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
and
i
saw
the
seven
angels
which
stood
before
god
and
to
them
were
given
seven
trumpets
and
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar
having
a
golden
censer
and
there
was
given
unto
him
much
incense
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
throne
and
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
came
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints
ascended
up
before
god
out
of
the
angel's
hand
and
the
angel
took
the
censer
and
filled
it
with
fire
of
the
altar
and
cast
it
into
the
earth
and
there
were
voices
and
thunderings
and
lightnings
and
an
earthquake
and
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
to
sound
the
first
angel
sounded
and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth
and
the
third
part
of
trees
was
burnt
up
and
all
green
grass
was
burnt
up
and
the
second
angel
sounded
and
as
it
were
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
the
third
part
of
the
sea
became
blood
and
the
third
part
of
the
creatures
which
were
in
the
sea
and
had
life
died
and
the
third
part
of
the
ships
were
destroyed
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven
burning
as
it
were
a
lamp
and
it
fell
upon
the
third
part
of
the
rivers
and
upon
the
fountains
of
waters
and
the
name
of
the
star
is
called
wormwood
and
the
third
part
of
the
waters
became
wormwood
and
many
men
died
of
the
waters
because
they
were
made
bitter
and
the
fourth
angel
sounded
and
the
third
part
of
the
sun
was
smitten
and
the
third
part
of
the
moon
and
the
third
part
of
the
stars
so
as
the
third
part
of
them
was
darkened
and
the
day
shone
not
for
a
third
part
of
it
and
the
night
likewise
and
i
beheld
and
heard
an
angel
flying
through
the
midst
of
heaven
saying
with
a
loud
voice
woe
woe
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet
of
the
three
angels
which
are
yet
to
sound
and
the
fifth
angel
sounded
and
i
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
and
to
him
was
given
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
he
opened
the
bottomless
pit
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
pit
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace
and
the
sun
and
the
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
pit
and
there
came
out
of
the
smoke
locusts
upon
the
earth
and
unto
them
was
given
power
as
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
power
and
it
was
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
hurt
the
grass
of
the
earth
neither
any
green
thing
neither
any
tree
but
only
those
men
which
have
not
the
seal
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
to
them
it
was
given
that
they
should
not
kill
them
but
that
they
should
be
tormented
five
months
and
their
torment
was
as
the
torment
of
a
scorpion
when
he
striketh
a
man
and
in
those
days
shall
men
seek
death
and
shall
not
find
it
and
shall
desire
to
die
and
death
shall
flee
from
them
and
the
shapes
of
the
locusts
were
like
unto
horses
prepared
unto
battle
and
on
their
heads
were
as
it
were
crowns
like
gold
and
their
faces
were
as
the
faces
of
men
and
they
had
hair
as
the
hair
of
women
and
their
teeth
were
as
the
teeth
of
lions
and
they
had
breastplates
as
it
were
breastplates
of
iron
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
as
the
sound
of
chariots
of
many
horses
running
to
battle
and
they
had
tails
like
unto
scorpions
and
there
were
stings
in
their
tails
and
their
power
was
to
hurt
men
five
months
and
they
had
a
king
over
them
which
is
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
pit
whose
name
in
the
hebrew
tongue
is
abaddon
but
in
the
greek
tongue
hath
his
name
apollyon
one
woe
is
past
and
behold
there
come
two
woes
more
hereafter
and
the
sixth
angel
sounded
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
four
horns
of
the
golden
altar
which
is
before
god
saying
to
the
sixth
angel
which
had
the
trumpet
loose
the
four
angels
which
are
bound
in
the
great
river
euphrates
and
the
four
angels
were
loosed
which
were
prepared
for
an
hour
and
a
day
and
a
month
and
a
year
for
to
slay
the
third
part
of
men
and
the
number
of
the
army
of
the
horsemen
were
two
hundred
thousand
thousand
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
and
thus
i
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
them
that
sat
on
them
having
breastplates
of
fire
and
of
jacinth
and
brimstone
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
as
the
heads
of
lions
and
out
of
their
mouths
issued
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
by
these
three
was
the
third
part
of
men
killed
by
the
fire
and
by
the
smoke
and
by
the
brimstone
which
issued
out
of
their
mouths
for
their
power
is
in
their
mouth
and
in
their
tails
for
their
tails
were
like
unto
serpents
and
had
heads
and
with
them
they
do
hurt
and
the
rest
of
the
men
which
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
yet
repented
not
of
the
works
of
their
hands
that
they
should
not
worship
devils
and
idols
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass
and
stone
and
of
wood
which
neither
can
see
nor
hear
nor
walk
neither
repented
they
of
their
murders
nor
of
their
sorceries
nor
of
their
fornication
nor
of
their
thefts
and
i
saw
another
mighty
angel
come
down
from
heaven
clothed
with
a
cloud
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
head
and
his
face
was
as
it
were
the
sun
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
fire
and
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
open
and
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
sea
and
his
left
foot
on
the
earth
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
as
when
a
lion
roareth
and
when
he
had
cried
seven
thunders
uttered
their
voices
and
when
the
seven
thunders
had
uttered
their
voices
i
was
about
to
write
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
seal
up
those
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered
and
write
them
not
and
the
angel
which
i
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
who
created
heaven
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
earth
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
sea
and
the
things
which
are
therein
that
there
should
be
time
no
longer
but
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound
the
mystery
of
god
should
be
finished
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
prophets
and
the
voice
which
i
heard
from
heaven
spake
unto
me
again
and
said
go
and
take
the
little
book
which
is
open
in
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
standeth
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
and
i
went
unto
the
angel
and
said
unto
him
give
me
the
little
book
and
he
said
unto
me
take
it
and
eat
it
up
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
i
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angel's
hand
and
ate
it
up
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
it
my
belly
was
bitter
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
and
there
was
given
me
a
reed
like
unto
a
rod
and
the
angel
stood
saying
rise
and
measure
the
temple
of
god
and
the
altar
and
them
that
worship
therein
but
the
court
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
out
and
measure
it
not
for
it
is
given
unto
the
gentiles
and
the
holy
city
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
months
and
i
will
give
power
unto
my
two
witnesses
and
they
shall
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
clothed
in
sackcloth
these
are
the
two
olive
trees
and
the
two
candlesticks
standing
before
the
god
of
the
earth
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
fire
proceedeth
out
of
their
mouth
and
devoureth
their
enemies
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
he
must
in
this
manner
be
killed
these
have
power
to
shut
heaven
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
prophecy
and
have
power
over
waters
to
turn
them
to
blood
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
plagues
as
often
as
they
will
and
when
they
shall
have
finished
their
testimony
the
beast
that
ascendeth
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
shall
make
war
against
them
and
shall
overcome
them
and
kill
them
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
city
which
spiritually
is
called
sodom
and
egypt
where
also
our
lord
was
crucified
and
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
half
and
shall
not
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
graves
and
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
them
and
make
merry
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
another
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
earth
and
after
three
days
and
an
half
the
spirit
of
life
from
god
entered
into
them
and
they
stood
upon
their
feet
and
great
fear
fell
upon
them
which
saw
them
and
they
heard
a
great
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
them
come
up
hither
and
they
ascended
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
and
their
enemies
beheld
them
and
the
same
hour
was
there
a
great
earthquake
and
the
tenth
part
of
the
city
fell
and
in
the
earthquake
were
slain
of
men
seven
thousand
and
the
remnant
were
affrighted
and
gave
glory
to
the
god
of
heaven
the
second
woe
is
past
and
behold
the
third
woe
cometh
quickly
and
the
seventh
angel
sounded
and
there
were
great
voices
in
heaven
saying
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
which
sat
before
god
on
their
seats
fell
upon
their
faces
and
worshipped
god
saying
we
give
thee
thanks
o
lord
god
almighty
which
art
and
wast
and
art
to
come
because
thou
hast
taken
to
thee
thy
great
power
and
hast
reigned
and
the
nations
were
angry
and
thy
wrath
is
come
and
the
time
of
the
dead
that
they
should
be
judged
and
that
thou
shouldest
give
reward
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets
and
to
the
saints
and
them
that
fear
thy
name
small
and
great
and
shouldest
destroy
them
which
destroy
the
earth
and
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
testament
and
there
were
lightnings
and
voices
and
thunderings
and
an
earthquake
and
great
hail
and
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
and
she
being
with
child
cried
travailing
in
birth
and
pained
to
be
delivered
and
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
heaven
and
behold
a
great
red
dragon
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
seven
crowns
upon
his
heads
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
which
was
ready
to
be
delivered
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
born
and
she
brought
forth
a
man
child
who
was
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
her
child
was
caught
up
unto
god
and
to
his
throne
and
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
god
that
they
should
feed
her
there
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
and
there
was
war
in
heaven
michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
fought
and
his
angels
and
prevailed
not
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more
in
heaven
and
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world
he
was
cast
out
into
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
him
and
i
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
heaven
now
is
come
salvation
and
strength
and
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
the
power
of
his
christ
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down
which
accused
them
before
our
god
day
and
night
and
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death
therefore
rejoice
ye
heavens
and
ye
that
dwell
in
them
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time
and
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
earth
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
child
and
to
the
woman
were
given
two
wings
of
a
great
eagle
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness
into
her
place
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
from
the
face
of
the
serpent
and
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
flood
after
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
flood
and
the
earth
helped
the
woman
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
up
the
flood
which
the
dragon
cast
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
woman
and
went
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
which
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
and
i
stood
upon
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
saw
a
beast
rise
up
out
of
the
sea
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
upon
his
horns
ten
crowns
and
upon
his
heads
the
name
of
blasphemy
and
the
beast
which
i
saw
was
like
unto
a
leopard
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
bear
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion
and
the
dragon
gave
him
his
power
and
his
seat
and
great
authority
and
i
saw
one
of
his
heads
as
it
were
wounded
to
death
and
his
deadly
wound
was
healed
and
all
the
world
wondered
after
the
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
dragon
which
gave
power
unto
the
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
beast
saying
who
is
like
unto
the
beast
who
is
able
to
make
war
with
him
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months
and
he
opened
his
mouth
in
blasphemy
against
god
to
blaspheme
his
name
and
his
tabernacle
and
them
that
dwell
in
heaven
and
it
was
given
unto
him
to
make
war
with
the
saints
and
to
overcome
them
and
power
was
given
him
over
all
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
and
all
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
worship
him
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
of
the
lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
if
any
man
have
an
ear
let
him
hear
he
that
leadeth
into
captivity
shall
go
into
captivity
he
that
killeth
with
the
sword
must
be
killed
with
the
sword
here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of
the
saints
and
i
beheld
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
and
he
had
two
horns
like
a
lamb
and
he
spake
as
a
dragon
and
he
exerciseth
all
the
power
of
the
first
beast
before
him
and
causeth
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
worship
the
first
beast
whose
deadly
wound
was
healed
and
he
doeth
great
wonders
so
that
he
maketh
fire
come
down
from
heaven
on
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
men
and
deceiveth
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
the
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
had
power
to
do
in
the
sight
of
the
beast
saying
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
beast
which
had
the
wound
by
a
sword
and
did
live
and
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
beast
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
speak
and
cause
that
as
many
as
would
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
should
be
killed
and
he
causeth
all
both
small
and
great
rich
and
poor
free
and
bond
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
hand
or
in
their
foreheads
and
that
no
man
might
buy
or
sell
save
he
that
had
the
mark
or
the
name
of
the
beast
or
the
number
of
his
name
here
is
wisdom
let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
and
his
number
is
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
and
i
looked
and
lo
a
lamb
stood
on
the
mount
sion
and
with
him
an
hundred
forty
and
four
thousand
having
his
father's
name
written
in
their
foreheads
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
a
great
thunder
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
and
they
sung
as
it
were
a
new
song
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
beasts
and
the
elders
and
no
man
could
learn
that
song
but
the
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
which
were
redeemed
from
the
earth
these
are
they
which
were
not
defiled
with
women
for
they
are
virgins
these
are
they
which
follow
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth
these
were
redeemed
from
among
men
being
the
firstfruits
unto
god
and
to
the
lamb
and
in
their
mouth
was
found
no
guile
for
they
are
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
god
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
and
there
followed
another
angel
saying
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
that
great
city
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
and
the
third
angel
followed
them
saying
with
a
loud
voice
if
any
man
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
receive
his
mark
in
his
forehead
or
in
his
hand
the
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
indignation
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
angels
and
in
the
presence
of
the
lamb
and
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
they
have
no
rest
day
nor
night
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
whosoever
receiveth
the
mark
of
his
name
here
is
the
patience
of
the
saints
here
are
they
that
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
faith
of
jesus
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
write
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labours
and
their
works
do
follow
them
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
white
cloud
and
upon
the
cloud
one
sat
like
unto
the
son
of
man
having
on
his
head
a
golden
crown
and
in
his
hand
a
sharp
sickle
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
crying
with
a
loud
voice
to
him
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
thy
sickle
and
reap
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
reap
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth
is
ripe
and
he
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
his
sickle
on
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
reaped
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
which
is
in
heaven
he
also
having
a
sharp
sickle
and
another
angel
came
out
from
the
altar
which
had
power
over
fire
and
cried
with
a
loud
cry
to
him
that
had
the
sharp
sickle
saying
thrust
in
thy
sharp
sickle
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
earth
for
her
grapes
are
fully
ripe
and
the
angel
thrust
in
his
sickle
into
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
earth
and
cast
it
into
the
great
winepress
of
the
wrath
of
god
and
the
winepress
was
trodden
without
the
city
and
blood
came
out
of
the
winepress
even
unto
the
horse
bridles
by
the
space
of
a
thousand
and
six
hundred
furlongs
and
i
saw
another
sign
in
heaven
great
and
marvellous
seven
angels
having
the
seven
last
plagues
for
in
them
is
filled
up
the
wrath
of
god
and
i
saw
as
it
were
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
them
that
had
gotten
the
victory
over
the
beast
and
over
his
image
and
over
his
mark
and
over
the
number
of
his
name
stand
on
the
sea
of
glass
having
the
harps
of
god
and
they
sing
the
song
of
moses
the
servant
of
god
and
the
song
of
the
lamb
saying
great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works
lord
god
almighty
just
and
true
are
thy
ways
thou
king
of
saints
who
shall
not
fear
thee
o
lord
and
glorify
thy
name
for
thou
only
art
holy
for
all
nations
shall
come
and
worship
before
thee
for
thy
judgments
are
made
manifest
and
after
that
i
looked
and
behold
the
temple
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
heaven
was
opened
and
the
seven
angels
came
out
of
the
temple
having
the
seven
plagues
clothed
in
pure
and
white
linen
and
having
their
breasts
girded
with
golden
girdles
and
one
of
the
four
beasts
gave
unto
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
vials
full
of
the
wrath
of
god
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
from
the
glory
of
god
and
from
his
power
and
no
man
was
able
to
enter
into
the
temple
till
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
fulfilled
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
saying
to
the
seven
angels
go
your
ways
and
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
earth
and
the
first
went
and
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
earth
and
there
fell
a
noisome
and
grievous
sore
upon
the
men
which
had
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
upon
them
which
worshipped
his
image
and
the
second
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sea
and
it
became
as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man
and
every
living
soul
died
in
the
sea
and
the
third
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
rivers
and
fountains
of
waters
and
they
became
blood
and
i
heard
the
angel
of
the
waters
say
thou
art
righteous
o
lord
which
art
and
wast
and
shalt
be
because
thou
hast
judged
thus
for
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
saints
and
prophets
and
thou
hast
given
them
blood
to
drink
for
they
are
worthy
and
i
heard
another
out
of
the
altar
say
even
so
lord
god
almighty
true
and
righteous
are
thy
judgments
and
the
fourth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sun
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
scorch
men
with
fire
and
men
were
scorched
with
great
heat
and
blasphemed
the
name
of
god
which
hath
power
over
these
plagues
and
they
repented
not
to
give
him
glory
and
the
fifth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
seat
of
the
beast
and
his
kingdom
was
full
of
darkness
and
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
pain
and
blasphemed
the
god
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
sores
and
repented
not
of
their
deeds
and
the
sixth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
great
river
euphrates
and
the
water
thereof
was
dried
up
that
the
way
of
the
kings
of
the
east
might
be
prepared
and
i
saw
three
unclean
spirits
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
dragon
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
beast
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
prophet
for
they
are
the
spirits
of
devils
working
miracles
which
go
forth
unto
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
of
the
whole
world
to
gather
them
to
the
battle
of
that
great
day
of
god
almighty
behold
i
come
as
a
thief
blessed
is
he
that
watcheth
and
keepeth
his
garments
lest
he
walk
naked
and
they
see
his
shame
and
he
gathered
them
together
into
a
place
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
armageddon
and
the
seventh
angel
poured
out
his
vial
into
the
air
and
there
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
of
heaven
from
the
throne
saying
it
is
done
and
there
were
voices
and
thunders
and
lightnings
and
there
was
a
great
earthquake
such
as
was
not
since
men
were
upon
the
earth
so
mighty
an
earthquake
and
so
great
and
the
great
city
was
divided
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
fell
and
great
babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
god
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
and
every
island
fled
away
and
the
mountains
were
not
found
and
there
fell
upon
men
a
great
hail
out
of
heaven
every
stone
about
the
weight
of
a
talent
and
men
blasphemed
god
because
of
the
plague
of
the
hail
for
the
plague
thereof
was
exceeding
great
and
there
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
and
talked
with
me
saying
unto
me
come
hither
i
will
shew
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
waters
with
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
fornication
so
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
and
i
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
coloured
beast
full
of
names
of
blasphemy
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
colour
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
having
a
golden
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
fornication
and
upon
her
forehead
was
a
name
written
mystery
babylon
the
great
the
mother
of
harlots
and
abominations
of
the
earth
and
i
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
jesus
and
when
i
saw
her
i
wondered
with
great
admiration
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
wherefore
didst
thou
marvel
i
will
tell
thee
the
mystery
of
the
woman
and
of
the
beast
that
carrieth
her
which
hath
the
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
the
beast
that
thou
sawest
was
and
is
not
and
shall
ascend
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
go
into
perdition
and
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
wonder
whose
names
were
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
when
they
behold
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
and
yet
is
and
here
is
the
mind
which
hath
wisdom
the
seven
heads
are
seven
mountains
on
which
the
woman
sitteth
and
there
are
seven
kings
five
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
come
and
when
he
cometh
he
must
continue
a
short
space
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
even
he
is
the
eighth
and
is
of
the
seven
and
goeth
into
perdition
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
kings
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
yet
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
hour
with
the
beast
these
have
one
mind
and
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
beast
these
shall
make
war
with
the
lamb
and
the
lamb
shall
overcome
them
for
he
is
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
called
and
chosen
and
faithful
and
he
saith
unto
me
the
waters
which
thou
sawest
where
the
whore
sitteth
are
peoples
and
multitudes
and
nations
and
tongues
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
beast
these
shall
hate
the
whore
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
naked
and
shall
eat
her
flesh
and
burn
her
with
fire
for
god
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
will
and
to
agree
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
beast
until
the
words
of
god
shall
be
fulfilled
and
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
city
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
after
these
things
i
saw
another
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
great
power
and
the
earth
was
lightened
with
his
glory
and
he
cried
mightily
with
a
strong
voice
saying
babylon
the
great
is
fallen
is
fallen
and
is
become
the
habitation
of
devils
and
the
hold
of
every
foul
spirit
and
a
cage
of
every
unclean
and
hateful
bird
for
all
nations
have
drunk
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
with
her
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
are
waxed
rich
through
the
abundance
of
her
delicacies
and
i
heard
another
voice
from
heaven
saying
come
out
of
her
my
people
that
ye
be
not
partakers
of
her
sins
and
that
ye
receive
not
of
her
plagues
for
her
sins
have
reached
unto
heaven
and
god
hath
remembered
her
iniquities
reward
her
even
as
she
rewarded
you
and
double
unto
her
double
according
to
her
works
in
the
cup
which
she
hath
filled
fill
to
her
double
how
much
she
hath
glorified
herself
and
lived
deliciously
so
much
torment
and
sorrow
give
her
for
she
saith
in
her
heart
i
sit
a
queen
and
am
no
widow
and
shall
see
no
sorrow
therefore
shall
her
plagues
come
in
one
day
death
and
mourning
and
famine
and
she
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
for
strong
is
the
lord
god
who
judgeth
her
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
who
have
committed
fornication
and
lived
deliciously
with
her
shall
bewail
her
and
lament
for
her
when
they
shall
see
the
smoke
of
her
burning
standing
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
babylon
that
mighty
city
for
in
one
hour
is
thy
judgment
come
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
shall
weep
and
mourn
over
her
for
no
man
buyeth
their
merchandise
any
more

and
all
the

and
sailors
and
as
many
as

by

stood
afar
off
and
cried
when
they
saw
the
smoke
of
her
burning
saying
what
city
is
like
unto
this
great
city
and
they
cast
dust
on
their
heads
and
cried
weeping
and
wailing
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
wherein
were
made
rich
all
that
had
ships
in
the
sea
by
reason
of
her
costliness
for
in

hour
is
she
made
desolate
rejoice
over
her
thou
heaven
and
ye
holy
apostles
and
prophets
for
god
hath
avenged
you
on
her
and
a
mighty
angel
took
up
a
stone
like
a
great
millstone
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
saying
thus
with
violence
shall
that
great
city
babylon
be
thrown
down
and
shall
be
found
no
more
at

in
thee
and
the

in
thee
and
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
of
the
bride
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
for
thy
merchants
were
the
great
men
of
the
earth
for
by
thy
sorceries
were
all
nations
deceived
and
in
her
was
found
the
blood
of
prophets
and
of
saints
and
of
all
that
were
slain
upon
the
earth
and
after
these
things
i
heard
a
great
voice
of
much
people
in
heaven
saying
alleluia
salvation
and
glory
and
honour
and
power
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
true
and
righteous
are
his
judgments
for
he
hath
judged
the
great
whore
which
did
corrupt
the
earth
with
her
fornication
and
hath
avenged
the
blood
of
his
servants
at
her
hand
and
again
they
said
alleluia
and
her
smoke
rose
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
and
the
four
beasts
fell
down
and
worshipped
god
that
sat
on
the
throne
saying
amen
alleluia
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
throne
saying
praise
our
god
all
ye
his
servants
and
ye
that
fear
him
both
small
and
great
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
voice
of
a
great
multitude
and
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
mighty
thunderings
saying
alleluia
for
the
lord
god
omnipotent
reigneth
let
us
be
glad
and
rejoice
and
give
honour
to
him
for
the
marriage
of
the
lamb
is
come
and
his
wife
hath
made
herself
ready
and
to
her
was
granted
that
she
should
be
arrayed
in
fine
linen
clean
and
white
for
the
fine
linen
is
the
righteousness
of
saints
and
he
saith
unto
me
write
blessed
are
they
which
are
called
unto
the
marriage
supper
of
the
lamb
and
he
saith
unto
me
these
are
the
true
sayings
of
god
and
i
fell
at
his
feet
to
worship
him
and
he
said
unto
me
see
thou
do
it
not
i
am
thy
fellowservant
and
of
thy
brethren
that
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
worship
god
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
i
saw
heaven
opened
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
upon
him
was
called
faithful
and
true
and
in
righteousness
he
doth
judge
and
make
war
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
on
his
head
were
many
crowns
and
he
had
a
name
written
that
no
man
knew
but
he
himself
and
he
was
clothed
with
a
vesture
dipped
in
blood
and
his
name
is
called
the
word
of
god
and
the
armies
which
were
in
heaven
followed
him
upon
white
horses
clothed
in
fine
linen
white
and
clean
and
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
sharp
sword
that
with
it
he
should
smite
the
nations
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
he
treadeth
the
winepress
of
the
fierceness
and
wrath
of
almighty
god
and
he
hath
on
his
vesture
and
on
his
thigh
a
name
written
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
and
i
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
to
all
the
fowls
that
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
come
and
gather
yourselves
together
unto
the
supper
of
the
great
god
that
ye
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
and
the
flesh
of
captains
and
the
flesh
of
mighty
men
and
the
flesh
of
horses
and
of
them
that
sit
on
them
and
the
flesh
of
all
men
both
free
and
bond
both
small
and
great
and
i
saw
the
beast
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
their
armies
gathered
together
to
make
war
against
him
that
sat
on
the
horse
and
against
his
army
and
the
beast
was
taken
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
that
wrought
miracles
before
him
with
which
he
deceived
them
that
had
received
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
them
that
worshipped
his
image
these
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone
and
the
remnant
were
slain
with
the
sword
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
horse
which
sword
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
and
all
the
fowls
were
filled
with
their
flesh
and
i
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
and
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon
that
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
and
satan
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years
and
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
and
shut
him
up
and
set
a
seal
upon
him
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled
and
after
that
he
must
be
loosed
a
little
season
and
i
saw
thrones
and
they
sat
upon
them
and
judgment
was
given
unto
them
and
i
saw
the
souls
of
them
that
were
beheaded
for
the
witness
of
jesus
and
for
the
word
of
god
and
which
had
not
worshipped
the
beast
neither
his
image
neither
had
received
his
mark
upon
their
foreheads
or
in
their
hands
and
they
lived
and
reigned
with
christ
a
thousand
years
but
the
rest
of
the
dead
lived
not
again
until
the
thousand
years
were
finished
this
is
the
first
resurrection
blessed
and
holy
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
but
they
shall
be
priests
of
god
and
of
christ
and
shall
reign
with
him
a
thousand
years
and
when
the
thousand
years
are
expired
satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison
and
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
which
are
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
gog
and
magog
to
gather
them
together
to
battle
the
number
of
whom
is
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
they
went
up
on
the
breadth
of
the
earth
and
compassed
the
camp
of
the
saints
about
and
the
beloved
city
and
fire
came
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
and
devoured
them
and
the
devil
that
deceived
them
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
the
beast
and
the
false
prophet
are
and
shall
be
tormented
day
and
night
for
ever
and
ever
and
i
saw
a
great
white
throne
and
him
that
sat
on
it
from
whose
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
fled
away
and
there
was
found
no
place
for
them
and
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
and
the
books
were
opened
and
another
book
was
opened
which
is
the
book
of
life
and
the
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books
according
to
their
works
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
their
works
and
death
and
hell
were
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
this
is
the
second
death
and
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
and
there
was
no
more
sea
and
i
john
saw
the
holy
city
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
behold
the
tabernacle
of
god
is
with
men
and
he
will
dwell
with
them
and
they
shall
be
his
people
and
god
himself
shall
be
with
them
and
be
their
god
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
and
he
that
sat
upon
the
throne
said
behold
i
make
all
things
new
and
he
said
unto
me
write
for
these
words
are
true
and
faithful
and
he
said
unto
me
it
is
done
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
i
will
give
unto
him
that
is
athirst
of
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
life
freely
he
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
and
i
will
be
his
god
and
he
shall
be
my
son
but
the
fearful
and
unbelieving
and
the
abominable
and
murderers
and
whoremongers
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
all
liars

have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone

is
the
second
death

with
me
saying

the
city
was
pure
gold
as
it
were
transparent
glass
and
i
saw
no
temple
therein
for
the
lord
god
almighty
and
the
lamb
are
the
temple
of
it
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
and
the
nations
of
them
which
are
saved
shall
walk
in
the
light
of
it
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
do
bring
their
glory
and
honour
into
it
and
the
gates
of
it
shall
not
be
shut
at
all
by
day
for
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
shall
bring
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
nations
into
it
and
there
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
it
any
thing
that
defileth
neither
whatsoever
worketh
abomination
or
maketh
a
lie
but
they
which
are
written
in
the
lamb's
book
of
life
and
he
shewed
me
a
pure
river
of
water
of
life
clear
as
crystal
proceeding
out
of
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
in
the
midst
of
the
street
of
it
and
on
either
side
of
the
river
was
there
the
tree
of
life
which
bare
twelve
manner
of
fruits
and
yielded
her
fruit
every
month
and
the
leaves
of
the
tree
were
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
and
there
shall
be
no
more
curse
but
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
shall
be
in
it
and
his
servants
shall
serve
him
and
they
shall
see
his
face
and
his
name
shall
be
in
their
foreheads
and
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
need
no
candle
neither
light
of
the
sun
for
the
lord
god
giveth
them
light
and
they
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
and
he
said
unto
me
these
sayings
are
faithful
and
true
and
the
lord
god
of
the
holy
prophets
sent
his
angel
to
shew
unto
his
servants
the
things
which
must
shortly
be
done
behold
i
come
quickly
blessed
is
he
that
keepeth
the
sayings
of
the
prophecy
of
this
book
and
i
john

these
things
and
heard
them
and
when
i
had
heard
and
seen
i
fell
down
to
worship
before
the
feet
of
the
angel
which
shewed
me
these
things
then
saith
he
unto

it
not

they
that
do
his
commandments
that
they
may
have
right
to
the
tree
of
life
and
may
enter
in
through
the
gates
into
the
city
for
without

dogs
and
sorcerers
and
whoremongers
and
murderers
and
idolaters
and
whosoever
loveth
and
maketh
a
lie

things

come
and

him
that

him
that
is
athirst

and
whosoever
will
let
him

water
of
life

things
