then
eli
called
samuel
and
said
samuel
my
son
and
he
answered
here
am
i
and
he
said
what
is
the
thing
that
the
lord
hath
said
unto
thee
i
pray
thee
hide
it
not
from
me
god
do
so
to
thee
and
more
also
if
thou
hide
any
thing
from
me
of
all
the
things
that
he
said
unto
thee
and
samuel
told
him
every
whit
and
hid
nothing
from
him
and
he
said
it
is
the
lord
let
him
do
what
seemeth
him
good
and
samuel
grew
and
the
lord
was
with
him
and
did
let
none
of
his
words
fall
to
the
ground
and
all
israel
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
knew
that
samuel
was
established
to
be
a
prophet
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
appeared
again
in
shiloh
for
the
lord
revealed
himself
to
samuel
in
shiloh
by
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
word
of
samuel
came
to
all
israel
now
israel
went
out
against
the
philistines
to
battle
and
pitched
beside
ebenezer
and
the
philistines
pitched
in
aphek
and
the
philistines
put
themselves
in
array
against
israel
and
when
they
joined
battle
israel
was
smitten
before
the
philistines
and
they
slew
of
the
army
in
the
field
about
four
thousand
men
and
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
camp
the
elders
of
israel
said
wherefore
hath
the
lord
smitten
us
to
day
before
the
philistines
let
us
fetch
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
out
of
shiloh
unto
us
that
when
it
cometh
among
us
it
may
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
so
the
people
sent
to
shiloh
that
they
might
bring
from
thence
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
of
hosts
which
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
were
there
with
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
and
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
came
into
the
camp
all
israel
shouted
with
a
great
shout
so
that
the
earth
rang
again
and
when
the
philistines
heard
the
noise
of
the
shout
they
said
what
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
great
shout
in
the
camp
of
the
hebrews
and
they
understood
that
the
ark
of
the
lord
was
come
into
the
camp
and
the
philistines
were
afraid
for
they
said
god
is
come
into
the
camp
and
they
said
woe
unto
us
for
there
hath
not
been
such
a
thing
heretofore
woe
unto
us
who
shall
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
these
mighty
gods
these
are
the
gods
that
smote
the
egyptians
with
all
the
plagues
in
the
wilderness
be
strong
and
quit
yourselves
like
men
o
ye
philistines
that
ye
be
not
servants
unto
the
hebrews
as
they
have
been
to
you
quit
yourselves
like
men
and
fight
and
the
philistines
fought
and
israel
was
smitten
and
they
fled
every
man
into
his
tent
and
there
was
a
very
great
slaughter
for
there
fell
of
israel
thirty
thousand
footmen
and
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
the
two
sons
of
eli
hophni
and
phinehas
were
slain
and
there
ran
a
man
of
benjamin
out
of
the
army
and
came
to
shiloh
the
same
day
with
his
clothes
rent
and
with
earth
upon
his
head
and
when
he
came
lo
eli
sat
upon
a
seat
by
the
wayside
watching
for
his
heart
trembled
for
the
ark
of
god
and
when
the
man
came
into
the
city
and
told
it
all
the
city
cried
out
and
when
eli
heard
the
noise
of
the
crying
he
said
what
meaneth
the
noise
of
this
tumult
and
the
man
came
in
hastily
and
told
eli
now
eli
was
ninety
and
eight
years
old
and
his
eyes
were
dim
that
he
could
not
see
and
the
man
said
unto
eli
i
am
he
that
came
out
of
the
army
and
i
fled
to
day
out
of
the
army
and
he
said
what
is
there
done
my
son
and
the
messenger
answered
and
said
israel
is
fled
before
the
philistines
and
there
hath
been
also
a
great
slaughter
among
the
people
and
thy
two
sons
also
hophni
and
phinehas
are
dead
and
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
made
mention
of
the
ark
of
god
that
he
fell
from
off
the
seat
backward
by
the
side
of
the
gate
and
his
neck
brake
and
he
died
for
he
was
an
old
man
and
heavy
and
he
had
judged
israel
forty
years
and
his
daughter
in
law
phinehas
wife
was
with
child
near
to
be
delivered
and
when
she
heard
the
tidings
that
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
that
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
were
dead
she
bowed
herself
and
travailed
for
her
pains
came
upon
her
and
about
the
time
of
her
death
the
women
that
stood
by
her
said
unto
her
fear
not
for
thou
hast
born
a
son
but
she
answered
not
neither
did
she
regard
it
and
she
named
the
child
ichabod
saying
the
glory
is
departed
from
israel
because
the
ark
of
god
was
taken
and
because
of
her
father
in
law
and
her
husband
and
she
said
the
glory
is
departed
from
israel
for
the
ark
of
god
is
taken
and
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
and
brought
it
from
ebenezer
unto
ashdod
when
the
philistines
took
the
ark
of
god
they
brought
it
into
the
house
of
dagon
and
set
it
by
dagon
and
when
they
of
ashdod
arose
early
on
the
morrow
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
they
took
dagon
and
set
him
in
his
place
again
and
when
they
arose
early
on
the
morrow
morning
behold
dagon
was
fallen
upon
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
head
of
dagon
and
both
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
cut
off
upon
the
threshold
only
the
stump
of
dagon
was
left
to
him
therefore
neither
the
priests
of
dagon
nor
any
that
come
into
dagon's
house
tread
on
the
threshold
of
dagon
in
ashdod
unto
this
day
but
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
heavy
upon
them
of
ashdod
and
he
destroyed
them
and
smote
them
with
emerods
even
ashdod
and
the
coasts
thereof
and
when
the
men
of
ashdod
saw
that
it
was
so
they
said
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
shall
not
abide
with
us
for
his
hand
is
sore
upon
us
and
upon
dagon
our
god
they
sent
therefore
and
gathered
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
unto
them
and
said
what
shall
we
do
with
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
and
they
answered
let
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
be
carried
about
unto
gath
and
they
carried
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
about
thither
and
it
was
so
that
after
they
had
carried
it
about
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
the
city
with
a
very
great
destruction
and
he
smote
the
men
of
the
city
both
small
and
great
and
they
had
emerods
in
their
secret
parts
therefore
they
sent
the
ark
of
god
to
ekron
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
ark
of
god
came
to
ekron
that
the
ekronites
cried
out
saying
they
have
brought
about
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
to
us
to
slay
us
and
our
people
so
they
sent
and
gathered
together
all
the
lords
of
the
philistines
and
said
send
away
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
and
let
it
go
again
to
his
own
place
that
it
slay
us
not
and
our
people
for
there
was
a
deadly
destruction
throughout
all
the
city
the
hand
of
god
was
very
heavy
there
and
the
men
that
died
not
were
smitten
with
the
emerods
and
the
cry
of
the
city
went
up
to
heaven
and
the
ark
of
the
lord
was
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
seven
months
and
the
philistines
called
for
the
priests
and
the
diviners
saying
what
shall
we
do
to
the
ark
of
the
lord
tell
us
wherewith
we
shall
send
it
to
his
place
and
they
said
if
ye
send
away
the
ark
of
the
god
of
israel
send
it
not
empty
but
in
any
wise
return
him
a
trespass
offering
then
ye
shall
be
healed
and
it
shall
be
known
to
you
why
his
hand
is
not
removed
from
you
then
said
they
what
shall
be
the
trespass
offering
which
we
shall
return
to
him
they
answered
five
golden
emerods
and
five
golden
mice
according
to
the
number
of
the
lords
of
the
philistines
for
one
plague
was
on
you
all
and
on
your
lords
wherefore
ye
shall
make
images
of
your
emerods
and
images
of
your
mice
that
mar
the
land
and
ye
shall
give
glory
unto
the
god
of
israel
peradventure
he
will
lighten
his
hand
from
off
you
and
from
off
your
gods
and
from
off
your
land
wherefore
then
do
ye
harden
your
hearts
as
the
egyptians
and
pharaoh
hardened
their
hearts
when
he
had
wrought
wonderfully
among
them
did
they
not
let
the
people
go
and
they
departed
now
therefore
make
a
new
cart
and
take
two
milch
kine
on
which
there
hath
come
no
yoke
and
tie
the
kine
to
the
cart
and
bring
their
calves
home
from
them
and
take
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
lay
it
upon
the
cart
and
put
the
jewels
of
gold
which
ye
return
him
for
a
trespass
offering
in
a
coffer
by
the
side
thereof
and
send
it
away
that
it
may
go
and
see
if
it
goeth
up
by
the
way
of
his
own
coast
to
bethshemesh
then
he
hath
done
us
this
great
evil
but
if
not
then
we
shall
know
that
it
is
not
his
hand
that
smote
us
it
was
a
chance
that
happened
to
us
and
the
men
did
so
and
took
two
milch
kine
and
tied
them
to
the
cart
and
shut
up
their
calves
at
home
and
they
laid
the
ark
of
the
lord
upon
the
cart
and
the
coffer
with
the
mice
of
gold
and
the
images
of
their
emerods
and
the
kine
took
the
straight
way
to
the
way
of
bethshemesh
and
went
along
the
highway
lowing
as
they
went
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
went
after
them
unto
the
border
of
bethshemesh
and
they
of
bethshemesh
were
reaping
their
wheat
harvest
in
the
valley
and
they
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
saw
the
ark
and
rejoiced
to
see
it
and
the
cart
came
into
the
field
of
joshua
a
bethshemite
and
stood
there
where
there
was
a
great
stone
and
they
clave
the
wood
of
the
cart
and
offered
the
kine
a
burnt
offering
unto
the
lord
and
the
levites
took
down
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
coffer
that
was
with
it
wherein
the
jewels
of
gold
were
and
put
them
on
the
great
stone
and
the
men
of
bethshemesh
offered
burnt
offerings
and
sacrificed
sacrifices
the
same
day
unto
the
lord
and
when
the
five
lords
of
the
philistines
had
seen
it
they
returned
to
ekron
the
same
day
and
these
are
the
golden
emerods
which
the
philistines
returned
for
a
trespass
offering
unto
the
lord
for
ashdod
one
for
gaza
one
for
askelon
one
for
gath
one
for
ekron
one
and
the
golden
mice
according
to
the
number
of
all
the
cities
of
the
philistines
belonging
to
the
five
lords
both
of
fenced
cities
and
of
country
villages
even
unto
the
great
stone
of
abel
whereon
they
set
down
the
ark
of
the
lord
which
stone
remaineth
unto
this
day
in
the
field
of
joshua
the
bethshemite
and
he
smote
the
men
of
bethshemesh
because
they
had
looked
into
the
ark
of
the
lord
even
he
smote
of
the
people
fifty
thousand
and
threescore
and
ten
men
and
the
people
lamented
because
the
lord
had
smitten
many
of
the
people
with
a
great
slaughter
and
the
men
of
bethshemesh
said
who
is
able
to
stand
before
this
holy
lord
god
and
to
whom
shall
he
go
up
from
us
and
they
sent
messengers
to
the
inhabitants
of
kirjathjearim
saying
the
philistines
have
brought
again
the
ark
of
the
lord
come
ye
down
and
fetch
it
up
to
you
and
the
men
of
kirjathjearim
came
and
fetched
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
brought
it
into
the
house
of
abinadab
in
the
hill
and
sanctified
eleazar
his
son
to
keep
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
while
the
ark
abode
in
kirjathjearim
that
the
time
was
long
for
it
was
twenty
years
and
all
the
house
of
israel
lamented
after
the
lord
and
samuel
spake
unto
all
the
house
of
israel
saying
if
ye
do
return
unto
the
lord
with
all
your
hearts
then
put
away
the
strange
gods
and
ashtaroth
from
among
you
and
prepare
your
hearts
unto
the
lord
and
serve
him
only
and
he
will
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
then
the
children
of
israel
did
put
away
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
served
the
lord
only
and
samuel
said
gather
all
israel
to
mizpeh
and
i
will
pray
for
you
unto
the
lord
and
they
gathered
together
to
mizpeh
and
drew
water
and
poured
it
out
before
the
lord
and
fasted
on
that
day
and
said
there
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
samuel
judged
the
children
of
israel
in
mizpeh
and
when
the
philistines
heard
that
the
children
of
israel
were
gathered
together
to
mizpeh
the
lords
of
the
philistines
went
up
against
israel
and
when
the
children
of
israel
heard
it
they
were
afraid
of
the
philistines
and
the
children
of
israel
said
to
samuel
cease
not
to
cry
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
us
that
he
will
save
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
samuel
took
a
sucking
lamb
and
offered
it
for
a
burnt
offering
wholly
unto
the
lord
and
samuel
cried
unto
the
lord
for
israel
and
the
lord
heard
him
and
as
samuel
was
offering
up
the
burnt
offering
the
philistines
drew
near
to
battle
against
israel
but
the
lord
thundered
with
a
great
thunder
on
that
day
upon
the
philistines
and
discomfited
them
and
they
were
smitten
before
israel
and
the
men
of
israel
went
out
of
mizpeh
and
pursued
the
philistines
and
smote
them
until
they
came
under
bethcar
then
samuel
took
a
stone
and
set
it
between
mizpeh
and
shen
and
called
the
name
of
it
ebenezer
saying
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
us
so
the
philistines
were
subdued
and
they
came
no
more
into
the
coast
of
israel
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
the
philistines
all
the
days
of
samuel
and
the
cities
which
the
philistines
had
taken
from
israel
were
restored
to
israel
from
ekron
even
unto
gath
and
the
coasts
thereof
did
israel
deliver
out
of
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
there
was
peace
between
israel
and
the
amorites
and
samuel
judged
israel
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
he
went
from
year
to
year
in
circuit
to
bethel
and
gilgal
and
mizpeh
and
judged
israel
in
all
those
places
and
his
return
was
to
ramah
for
there
was
his
house
and
there
he
judged
israel
and
there
he
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
when
samuel
was
old
that
he
made
his
sons
judges
over
israel
now
the
name
of
his
firstborn
was
joel
and
the
name
of
his
second
abiah
they
were
judges
in
beersheba
and
his
sons
walked
not
in
his
ways
but
turned
aside
after
lucre
and
took
bribes
and
perverted
judgment
then
all
the
elders
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
to
samuel
unto
ramah
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
old
and
thy
sons
walk
not
in
thy
ways
now
make
us
a
king
to
judge
us
like
all
the
nations
but
the
thing
displeased
samuel
when
they
said
give
us
a
king
to
judge
us
and
samuel
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
people
in
all
that
they
say
unto
thee
for
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
me
that
i
should
not
reign
over
them
according
to
all
the
works
which
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
wherewith
they
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
so
do
they
also
unto
thee
now
therefore
hearken
unto
their
voice
howbeit
yet
protest
solemnly
unto
them
and
shew
them
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
them
and
samuel
told
all
the
words
of
the
lord
unto
the
people
that
asked
of
him
a
king
and
he
said
this
will
be
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
you
he
will
take
your
sons
and
appoint
them
for
himself
for
his
chariots
and
to
be
his
horsemen
and
some
shall
run
before
his
chariots
and
he
will
appoint
him
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
fifties
and
will
set
them
to
ear
his
ground
and
to
reap
his
harvest
and
to
make
his
instruments
of
war
and
instruments
of
his
chariots
and
he
will
take
your
daughters
to
be
confectionaries
and
to
be
cooks
and
to
be
bakers
and
he
will
take
your
fields
and
your
vineyards
and
your
oliveyards
even
the
best
of
them
and
give
them
to
his
servants
and
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
seed
and
of
your
vineyards
and
give
to
his
officers
and
to
his
servants
and
he
will
take
your
menservants
and
your
maidservants
and
your
goodliest
young
men
and
your
asses
and
put
them
to
his
work
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
sheep
and
ye
shall
be
his
servants
and
ye
shall
cry
out
in
that
day
because
of
your
king
which
ye
shall
have
chosen
you
and
the
lord
will
not
hear
you
in
that
day
nevertheless
the
people
refused
to
obey
the
voice
of
samuel
and
they
said
nay
but
we
will
have
a
king
over
us
that
we
also
may
be
like
all
the
nations
and
that
our
king
may
judge
us
and
go
out
before
us
and
fight
our
battles
and
samuel
heard
all
the
words
of
the
people
and
he
rehearsed
them
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
to
samuel
hearken
unto
their
voice
and
make
them
a
king
and
samuel
said
unto
the
men
of
israel
go
ye
every
man
unto
his
city
now
there
was
a
man
of
benjamin
whose
name
was
kish
the
son
of
abiel
the
son
of
zeror
the
son
of
bechorath
the
son
of
aphiah
a
benjamite
a
mighty
man
of
power
and
he
had
a
son
whose
name
was
saul
a
choice
young
man
and
a
goodly
and
there
was
not
among
the
children
of
israel
a
goodlier
person
than
he
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
and
the
asses
of
kish
saul's
father
were
lost
and
kish
said
to
saul
his
son
take
now
one
of
the
servants
with
thee
and
arise
go
seek
the
asses
and
he
passed
through
mount
ephraim
and
passed
through
the
land
of
shalisha
but
they
found
them
not
then
they
passed
through
the
land
of
shalim
and
there
they
were
not
and
he
passed
through
the
land
of
the
benjamites
but
they
found
them
not
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
land
of
zuph
saul
said
to
his
servant
that
was
with
him
come
and
let
us
return
lest
my
father
leave
caring
for
the
asses
and
take
thought
for
us
and
he
said
unto
him
behold
now
there
is
in
this
city
a
man
of
god
and
he
is
an
honourable
man
all
that
he
saith
cometh
surely
to
pass
now
let
us
go
thither
peradventure
he
can
shew
us
our
way
that
we
should
go
then
said
saul
to
his
servant
but
behold
if
we
go
what
shall
we
bring
the
man
for
the
bread
is
spent
in
our
vessels
and
there
is
not
a
present
to
bring
to
the
man
of
god
what
have
we
and
the
servant
answered
saul
again
and
said
behold
i
have
here
at
hand
the
fourth
part
of
a
shekel
of
silver
that
will
i
give
to
the
man
of
god
to
tell
us
our
way
beforetime
in
israel
when
a
man
went
to
enquire
of
god
thus
he
spake
come
and
let
us
go
to
the
seer
for
he
that
is
now
called
a
prophet
was
beforetime
called
a
seer
then
said
saul
to
his
servant
well
said
come
let
us
go
so
they
went
unto
the
city
where
the
man
of
god
was
and
as
they
went
up
the
hill
to
the
city
they
found
young
maidens
going
out
to
draw
water
and
said
unto
them
is
the
seer
here
and
they
answered
them
and
said
he
is
behold
he
is
before
you
make
haste
now
for
he
came
to
day
to
the
city
for
there
is
a
sacrifice
of
the
people
to
day
in
the
high
place
as
soon
as
ye
be
come
into
the
city
ye
shall
straightway
find
him
before
he
go
up
to
the
high
place
to
eat
for
the
people
will
not
eat
until
he
come
because
he
doth
bless
the
sacrifice
and
afterwards
they
eat
that
be
bidden
now
therefore
get
you
up
for
about
this
time
ye
shall
find
him
and
they
went
up
into
the
city
and
when
they
were
come
into
the
city
behold
samuel
came
out
against
them
for
to
go
up
to
the
high
place
now
the
lord
had
told
samuel
in
his
ear
a
day
before
saul
came
saying
to
morrow
about
this
time
i
will
send
thee
a
man
out
of
the
land
of
benjamin
and
thou
shalt
anoint
him
to
be
captain
over
my
people
israel
that
he
may
save
my
people
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
for
i
have
looked
upon
my
people
because
their
cry
is
come
unto
me
and
when
samuel
saw
saul
the
lord
said
unto
him
behold
the
man
whom
i
spake
to
thee
of
this
same
shall
reign
over
my
people
then
saul
drew
near
to
samuel
in
the
gate
and
said
tell
me
i
pray
thee
where
the
seer's
house
is
and
samuel
answered
saul
and
said
i
am
the
seer
go
up
before
me
unto
the
high
place
for
ye
shall
eat
with
me
to
day
and
to
morrow
i
will
let
thee
go
and
will
tell
thee
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
and
as
for
thine
asses
that
were
lost
three
days
ago
set
not
thy
mind
on
them
for
they
are
found
and
on
whom
is
all
the
desire
of
israel
is
it
not
on
thee
and
on
all
thy
father's
house
and
saul
answered
and
said
am
not
i
a
benjamite
of
the
smallest
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
my
family
the
least
of
all
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
wherefore
then
speakest
thou
so
to
me
and
samuel
took
saul
and
his
servant
and
brought
them
into
the
parlour
and
made
them
sit
in
the
chiefest
place
among
them
that
were
bidden
which
were
about
thirty
persons
and
samuel
said
unto
the
cook
bring
the
portion
which
i
gave
thee
of
which
i
said
unto
thee
set
it
by
thee
and
the
cook
took
up
the
shoulder
and
that
which
was
upon
it
and
set
it
before
saul
and
samuel
said
behold
that
which
is
left
set
it
before
thee
and
eat
for
unto
this
time
hath
it
been
kept
for
thee
since
i
said
i
have
invited
the
people
so
saul
did
eat
with
samuel
that
day
and
when
they
were
come
down
from
the
high
place
into
the
city
samuel
communed
with
saul
upon
the
top
of
the
house
and
they
arose
early
and
it
came
to
pass
about
the
spring
of
the
day
that
samuel
called
saul
to
the
top
of
the
house
saying
up
that
i
may
send
thee
away
and
saul
arose
and
they
went
out
both
of
them
he
and
samuel
abroad
and
as
they
were
going
down
to
the
end
of
the
city
samuel
said
to
saul
bid
the
servant
pass
on
before
us
and
he
passed
on
but
stand
thou
still
a
while
that
i
may
shew
thee
the
word
of
god
then
samuel
took
a
vial
of
oil
and
poured
it
upon
his
head
and
kissed
him
and
said
is
it
not
because
the
lord
hath
anointed
thee
to
be
captain
over
his
inheritance
when
thou
art
departed
from
me
to
day
then
thou
shalt
find
two
men
by
rachel's
sepulchre
in
the
border
of
benjamin
at
zelzah
and
they
will
say
unto
thee
the
asses
which
thou
wentest
to
seek
are
found
and
lo
thy
father
hath
left
the
care
of
the
asses
and
sorroweth
for
you
saying
what
shall
i
do
for
my
son
then
shalt
thou
go
on
forward
from
thence
and
thou
shalt
come
to
the
plain
of
tabor
and
there
shall
meet
thee
three
men
going
up
to
god
to
bethel
one
carrying
three
kids
and
another
carrying
three
loaves
of
bread
and
another
carrying
a
bottle
of
wine
and
they
will
salute
thee
and
give
thee
two
loaves
of
bread
which
thou
shalt
receive
of
their
hands
after
that
thou
shalt
come
to
the
hill
of
god
where
is
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
thou
art
come
thither
to
the
city
that
thou
shalt
meet
a
company
of
prophets
coming
down
from
the
high
place
with
a
psaltery
and
a
tabret
and
a
pipe
and
a
harp
before
them
and
they
shall
prophesy
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
come
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
with
them
and
shalt
be
turned
into
another
man
and
let
it
be
when
these
signs
are
come
unto
thee
that
thou
do
as
occasion
serve
thee
for
god
is
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
go
down
before
me
to
gilgal
and
behold
i
will
come
down
unto
thee
to
offer
burnt
offerings
and
to
sacrifice
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
seven
days
shalt
thou
tarry
till
i
come
to
thee
and
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
and
it
was
so
that
when
he
had
turned
his
back
to
go
from
samuel
god
gave
him
another
heart
and
all
those
signs
came
to
pass
that
day
and
when
they
came
thither
to
the
hill
behold
a
company
of
prophets
met
him
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
him
and
he
prophesied
among
them
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
that
knew
him
beforetime
saw
that
behold
he
prophesied
among
the
prophets
then
the
people
said
one
to
another
what
is
this
that
is
come
unto
the
son
of
kish
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
and
one
of
the
same
place
answered
and
said
but
who
is
their
father
therefore
it
became
a
proverb
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
he
came
to
the
high
place
and
saul's
uncle
said
unto
him
and
to
his
servant
whither
went
ye
and
he
said
to
seek
the
asses
and
when
we
saw
that
they
were
no
where
we
came
to
samuel
and
saul's
uncle
said
tell
me
i
pray
thee
what
samuel
said
unto
you
and
saul
said
unto
his
uncle
he
told
us
plainly
that
the
asses
were
found
but
of
the
matter
of
the
kingdom
whereof
samuel
spake
he
told
him
not
and
samuel
called
the
people
together
unto
the
lord
to
mizpeh
and
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
brought
up
israel
out
of
egypt
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
egyptians
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
kingdoms
and
of
them
that
oppressed
you
and
ye
have
this
day
rejected
your
god
who
himself
saved
you
out
of
all
your
adversities
and
your
tribulations
and
ye
have
said
unto
him
nay
but
set
a
king
over
us
now
therefore
present
yourselves
before
the
lord
by
your
tribes
and
by
your
thousands
and
when
samuel
had
caused
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
come
near
the
tribe
of
benjamin
was
taken
when
he
had
caused
the
tribe
of
benjamin
to
come
near
by
their
families
the
family
of
matri
was
taken
and
saul
the
son
of
kish
was
taken
and
when
they
sought
him
he
could
not
be
found
therefore
they
enquired
of
the
lord
further
if
the
man
should
yet
come
thither
and
the
lord
answered
behold
he
hath
hid
himself
among
the
stuff
and
they
ran
and
fetched
him
thence
and
when
he
stood
among
the
people
he
was
higher
than
any
of
the
people
from
his
shoulders
and
upward
and
samuel
said
to
all
the
people
see
ye
him
whom
the
lord
hath
chosen
that
there
is
none
like
him
among
all
the
people
and
all
the
people
shouted
and
said
god
save
the
king
then
samuel
told
the
people
the
manner
of
the
kingdom
and
wrote
it
in
a
book
and
laid
it
up
before
the
lord
and
samuel
sent
all
the
people
away
every
man
to
his
house
and
saul
also
went
home
to
gibeah
and
there
went
with
him
a
band
of
men
whose
hearts
god
had
touched
but
the
children
of
belial
said
how
shall
this
man
save
us
and
they
despised
him
and
brought
no
presents
but
he
held
his
peace
then
nahash
the
ammonite
came
up
and
encamped
against
jabeshgilead
and
all
the
men
of
jabesh
said
unto
nahash
make
a
covenant
with
us
and
we
will
serve
thee
and
nahash
the
ammonite
answered
them
on
this
condition
will
i
make
a
covenant
with
you
that
i
may
thrust
out
all
your
right
eyes
and
lay
it
for
a
reproach
upon
all
israel
and
the
elders
of
jabesh
said
unto
him
give
us
seven
days
respite
that
we
may
send
messengers
unto
all
the
coasts
of
israel
and
then
if
there
be
no
man
to
save
us
we
will
come
out
to
thee
then
came
the
messengers
to
gibeah
of
saul
and
told
the
tidings
in
the
ears
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
and
behold
saul
came
after
the
herd
out
of
the
field
and
saul
said
what
aileth
the
people
that
they
weep
and
they
told
him
the
tidings
of
the
men
of
jabesh
and
the
spirit
of
god
came
upon
saul
when
he
heard
those
tidings
and
his
anger
was
kindled
greatly
and
he
took
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
hewed
them
in
pieces
and
sent
them
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
by
the
hands
of
messengers
saying
whosoever
cometh
not
forth
after
saul
and
after
samuel
so
shall
it
be
done
unto
his
oxen
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
fell
on
the
people
and
they
came
out
with
one
consent
and
when
he
numbered
them
in
bezek
the
children
of
israel
were
three
hundred
thousand
and
the
men
of
judah
thirty
thousand
and
they
said
unto
the
messengers
that
came
thus
shall
ye
say
unto
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
to
morrow
by
that
time
the
sun
be
hot
ye
shall
have
help
and
the
messengers
came
and
shewed
it
to
the
men
of
jabesh
and
they
were
glad
therefore
the
men
of
jabesh
said
to
morrow
we
will
come
out
unto
you
and
ye
shall
do
with
us
all
that
seemeth
good
unto
you
and
it
was
so
on
the
morrow
that
saul
put
the
people
in
three
companies
and
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
host
in
the
morning
watch
and
slew
the
ammonites
until
the
heat
of
the
day
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
which
remained
were
scattered
so
that
two
of
them
were
not
left
together
and
the
people
said
unto
samuel
who
is
he
that
said
shall
saul
reign
over
us
bring
the
men
that
we
may
put
them
to
death
and
saul
said
there
shall
not
a
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
for
to
day
the
lord
hath
wrought
salvation
in
israel
then
said
samuel
to
the
people
come
and
let
us
go
to
gilgal
and
renew
the
kingdom
there
and
all
the
people
went
to
gilgal
and
there
they
made
saul
king
before
the
lord
in
gilgal
and
there
they
sacrificed
sacrifices
of
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
and
there
saul
and
all
the
men
of
israel
rejoiced
greatly
and
samuel
said
unto
all
israel
behold
i
have
hearkened
unto
your
voice
in
all
that
ye
said
unto
me
and
have
made
a
king
over
you
and
now
behold
the
king
walketh
before
you
and
i
am
old
and
grayheaded
and
behold
my
sons
are
with
you
and
i
have
walked
before
you
from
my
childhood
unto
this
day
behold
here
i
am
witness
against
me
before
the
lord
and
before
his
anointed
whose
ox
have
i
taken
or
whose
ass
have
i
taken
or
whom
have
i
defrauded
whom
have
i
oppressed
or
of
whose
hand
have
i
received
any
bribe
to
blind
mine
eyes
therewith
and
i
will
restore
it
you
and
they
said
thou
hast
not
defrauded
us
nor
oppressed
us
neither
hast
thou
taken
ought
of
any
man's
hand
and
he
said
unto
them
the
lord
is
witness
against
you
and
his
anointed
is
witness
this
day
that
ye
have
not
found
ought
in
my
hand
and
they
answered
he
is
witness
and
samuel
said
unto
the
people
it
is
the
lord
that
advanced
moses
and
aaron
and
that
brought
your
fathers
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
now
therefore
stand
still
that
i
may
reason
with
you
before
the
lord
of
all
the
righteous
acts
of
the
lord
which
he
did
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
when
jacob
was
come
into
egypt
and
your
fathers
cried
unto
the
lord
then
the
lord
sent
moses
and
aaron
which
brought
forth
your
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
made
them
dwell
in
this
place
and
when
they
forgat
the
lord
their
god
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
sisera
captain
of
the
host
of
hazor
and
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
moab
and
they
fought
against
them
and
they
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
we
have
sinned
because
we
have
forsaken
the
lord
and
have
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
but
now
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
and
we
will
serve
thee
and
the
lord
sent
jerubbaal
and
bedan
and
jephthah
and
samuel
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
your
enemies
on
every
side
and
ye
dwelled
safe
and
when
ye
saw
that
nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
came
against
you
ye
said
unto
me
nay
but
a
king
shall
reign
over
us
when
the
lord
your
god
was
your
king
now
therefore
behold
the
king
whom
ye
have
chosen
and
whom
ye
have
desired
and
behold
the
lord
hath
set
a
king
over
you
if
ye
will
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
and
obey
his
voice
and
not
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
then
shall
both
ye
and
also
the
king
that
reigneth
over
you
continue
following
the
lord
your
god
but
if
ye
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
but
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
the
lord
then
shall
the
hand
of
the
lord
be
against
you
as
it
was
against
your
fathers
now
therefore
stand
and
see
this
great
thing
which
the
lord
will
do
before
your
eyes
is
it
not
wheat
harvest
to
day
i
will
call
unto
the
lord
and
he
shall
send
thunder
and
rain
that
ye
may
perceive
and
see
that
your
wickedness
is
great
which
ye
have
done
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
asking
you
a
king
so
samuel
called
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
sent
thunder
and
rain
that
day
and
all
the
people
greatly
feared
the
lord
and
samuel
and
all
the
people
said
unto
samuel
pray
for
thy
servants
unto
the
lord
thy
god
that
we
die
not
for
we
have
added
unto
all
our
sins
this
evil
to
ask
us
a
king
and
samuel
said
unto
the
people
fear
not
ye
have
done
all
this
wickedness
yet
turn
not
aside
from
following
the
lord
but
serve
the
lord
with
all
your
heart
and
turn
ye
not
aside
for
then
should
ye
go
after
vain
things
which
cannot
profit
nor
deliver
for
they
are
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
forsake
his
people
for
his
great
name's
sake
because
it
hath
pleased
the
lord
to
make
you
his
people
moreover
as
for
me
god
forbid
that
i
should
sin
against
the
lord
in
ceasing
to
pray
for
you
but
i
will
teach
you
the
good
and
the
right
way
only
fear
the
lord
and
serve
him
in
truth
with
all
your
heart
for
consider
how
great
things
he
hath
done
for
you
but
if
ye
shall
still
do
wickedly
ye
shall
be
consumed
both
ye
and
your
king
saul
reigned
one
year
and
when
he
had
reigned
two
years
over
israel
saul
chose
him
three
thousand
men
of
israel
whereof
two
thousand
were
with
saul
in
michmash
and
in
mount
bethel
and
a
thousand
were
with
jonathan
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
sent
every
man
to
his
tent
and
jonathan
smote
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
that
was
in
geba
and
the
philistines
heard
of
it
and
saul
blew
the
trumpet
throughout
all
the
land
saying
let
the
hebrews
hear
and
all
israel
heard
say
that
saul
had
smitten
a
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
that
israel
also
was
had
in
abomination
with
the
philistines
and
the
people
were
called
together
after
saul
to
gilgal
and
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
to
fight
with
israel
thirty
thousand
chariots
and
six
thousand
horsemen
and
people
as
the
sand
which
is
on
the
sea
shore
in
multitude
and
they
came
up
and
pitched
in
michmash
eastward
from
bethaven
when
the
men
of
israel
saw
that
they
were
in
a
strait
for
the
people
were
distressed
then
the
people
did
hide
themselves
in
caves
and
in
thickets
and
in
rocks
and
in
high
places
and
in
pits
and
some
of
the
hebrews
went
over
jordan
to
the
land
of
gad
and
gilead
as
for
saul
he
was
yet
in
gilgal
and
all
the
people
followed
him
trembling
and
he
tarried
seven
days
according
to
the
set
time
that
samuel
had
appointed
but
samuel
came
not
to
gilgal
and
the
people
were
scattered
from
him
and
saul
said
bring
hither
a
burnt
offering
to
me
and
peace
offerings
and
he
offered
the
burnt
offering
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering
behold
samuel
came
and
saul
went
out
to
meet
him
that
he
might
salute
him
and
samuel
said
what
hast
thou
done
and
saul
said
because
i
saw
that
the
people
were
scattered
from
me
and
that
thou
camest
not
within
the
days
appointed
and
that
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
at
michmash
therefore
said
i
the
philistines
will
come
down
now
upon
me
to
gilgal
and
i
have
not
made
supplication
unto
the
lord
i
forced
myself
therefore
and
offered
a
burnt
offering
and
samuel
said
to
saul
thou
hast
done
foolishly
thou
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
of
the
lord
thy
god
which
he
commanded
thee
for
now
would
the
lord
have
established
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
but
now
thy
kingdom
shall
not
continue
the
lord
hath
sought
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
the
lord
hath
commanded
him
to
be
captain
over
his
people
because
thou
hast
not
kept
that
which
the
lord
commanded
thee
and
samuel
arose
and
gat
him
up
from
gilgal
unto
gibeah
of
benjamin
and
saul
numbered
the
people
that
were
present
with
him
about
six
hundred
men
and
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
and
the
people
that
were
present
with
them
abode
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
but
the
philistines
encamped
in
michmash
and
the
spoilers
came
out
of
the
camp
of
the
philistines
in
three
companies
one
company
turned
unto
the
way
that
leadeth
to
ophrah
unto
the
land
of
shual
and
another
company
turned
the
way
to
bethhoron
and
another
company
turned
to
the
way
of
the
border
that
looketh
to
the
valley
of
zeboim
toward
the
wilderness
now
there
was
no
smith
found
throughout
all
the
land
of
israel
for
the
philistines
said
lest
the
hebrews
make
them
swords
or
spears
but
all
the
israelites
went
down
to
the
philistines
to
sharpen
every
man
his
share
and
his
coulter
and
his
axe
and
his
mattock
yet
they
had
a
file
for
the
mattocks
and
for
the
coulters
and
for
the
forks
and
for
the
axes
and
to
sharpen
the
goads
so
it
came
to
pass
in
the
day
of
battle
that
there
was
neither
sword
nor
spear
found
in
the
hand
of
any
of
the
people
that
were
with
saul
and
jonathan
but
with
saul
and
with
jonathan
his
son
was
there
found
and
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
went
out
to
the
passage
of
michmash
now
it
came
to
pass
upon
a
day
that
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
said
unto
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour
come
and
let
us
go
over
to
the
philistines
garrison
that
is
on
the
other
side
but
he
told
not
his
father
and
saul
tarried
in
the
uttermost
part
of
gibeah
under
a
pomegranate
tree
which
is
in
migron
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
were
about
six
hundred
men
and
ahiah
the
son
of
ahitub
ichabod's
brother
the
son
of
phinehas
the
son
of
eli
the
lord's
priest
in
shiloh
wearing
an
ephod
and
the
people
knew
not
that
jonathan
was
gone
and
between
the
passages
by
which
jonathan
sought
to
go
over
unto
the
philistines
garrison
there
was
a
sharp
rock
on
the
one
side
and
a
sharp
rock
on
the
other
side
and
the
name
of
the
one
was
bozez
and
the
name
of
the
other
seneh
the
forefront
of
the
one
was
situate
northward
over
against
michmash
and
the
other
southward
over
against
gibeah
and
jonathan
said
to
the
young
man
that
bare
his
armour
come
and
let
us
go
over
unto
the
garrison
of
these
uncircumcised
it
may
be
that
the
lord
will
work
for
us
for
there
is
no
restraint
to
the
lord
to
save
by
many
or
by
few
and
his
armourbearer
said
unto
him
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
turn
thee
behold
i
am
with
thee
according
to
thy
heart
then
said
jonathan
behold
we
will
pass
over
unto
these
men
and
we
will
discover
ourselves
unto
them
if
they
say
thus
unto
us
tarry
until
we
come
to
you
then
we
will
stand
still
in
our
place
and
will
not
go
up
unto
them
but
if
they
say
thus
come
up
unto
us
then
we
will
go
up
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hand
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
us
and
both
of
them
discovered
themselves
unto
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
said
behold
the
hebrews
come
forth
out
of
the
holes
where
they
had
hid
themselves
and
the
men
of
the
garrison
answered
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
and
said
come
up
to
us
and
we
will
shew
you
a
thing
and
jonathan
said
unto
his
armourbearer
come
up
after
me
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
and
jonathan
climbed
up
upon
his
hands
and
upon
his
feet
and
his
armourbearer
after
him
and
they
fell
before
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
slew
after
him
and
that
first
slaughter
which
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
made
was
about
twenty
men
within
as
it
were
an
half
acre
of
land
which
a
yoke
of
oxen
might
plow
and
there
was
trembling
in
the
host
in
the
field
and
among
all
the
people
the
garrison
and
the
spoilers
they
also
trembled
and
the
earth
quaked
so
it
was
a
very
great
trembling
and
the
watchmen
of
saul
in
gibeah
of
benjamin
looked
and
behold
the
multitude
melted
away
and
they
went
on
beating
down
one
another
then
said
saul
unto
the
people
that
were
with
him
number
now
and
see
who
is
gone
from
us
and
when
they
had
numbered
behold
jonathan
and
his
armourbearer
were
not
there
and
saul
said
unto
ahiah
bring
hither
the
ark
of
god
for
the
ark
of
god
was
at
that
time
with
the
children
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
while
saul
talked
unto
the
priest
that
the
noise
that
was
in
the
host
of
the
philistines
went
on
and
increased
and
saul
said
unto
the
priest
withdraw
thine
hand
and
saul
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
assembled
themselves
and
they
came
to
the
battle
and
behold
every
man's
sword
was
against
his
fellow
and
there
was
a
very
great
discomfiture
moreover
the
hebrews
that
were
with
the
philistines
before
that
time
which
went
up
with
them
into
the
camp
from
the
country
round
about
even
they
also
turned
to
be
with
the
israelites
that
were
with
saul
and
jonathan
likewise
all
the
men
of
israel
which
had
hid
themselves
in
mount
ephraim
when
they
heard
that
the
philistines
fled
even
they
also
followed
hard
after
them
in
the
battle
so
the
lord
saved
israel
that
day
and
the
battle
passed
over
unto
bethaven
and
the
men
of
israel
were
distressed
that
day
for
saul
had
adjured
the
people
saying
cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
until
evening
that
i
may
be
avenged
on
mine
enemies
so
none
of
the
people
tasted
any
food
and
all
they
of
the
land
came
to
a
wood
and
there
was
honey
upon
the
ground
and
when
the
people
were
come
into
the
wood
behold
the
honey
dropped
but
no
man
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
for
the
people
feared
the
oath
but
jonathan
heard
not
when
his
father
charged
the
people
with
the
oath
wherefore
he
put
forth
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
his
hand
and
dipped
it
in
an
honeycomb
and
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
were
enlightened
then
answered
one
of
the
people
and
said
thy
father
straitly
charged
the
people
with
an
oath
saying
cursed
be
the
man
that
eateth
any
food
this
day
and
the
people
were
faint
then
said
jonathan
my
father
hath
troubled
the
land
see
i
pray
you
how
mine
eyes
have
been
enlightened
because
i
tasted
a
little
of
this
honey
how
much
more
if
haply
the
people
had
eaten
freely
to
day
of
the
spoil
of
their
enemies
which
they
found
for
had
there
not
been
now
a
much
greater
slaughter
among
the
philistines
and
they
smote
the
philistines
that
day
from
michmash
to
aijalon
and
the
people
were
very
faint
and
the
people
flew
upon
the
spoil
and
took
sheep
and
oxen
and
calves
and
slew
them
on
the
ground
and
the
people
did
eat
them
with
the
blood
then
they
told
saul
saying
behold
the
people
sin
against
the
lord
in
that
they
eat
with
the
blood
and
he
said
ye
have
transgressed
roll
a
great
stone
unto
me
this
day
and
saul
said
disperse
yourselves
among
the
people
and
say
unto
them
bring
me
hither
every
man
his
ox
and
every
man
his
sheep
and
slay
them
here
and
eat
and
sin
not
against
the
lord
in
eating
with
the
blood
and
all
the
people
brought
every
man
his
ox
with
him
that
night
and
slew
them
there
and
saul
built
an
altar
unto
the
lord
the
same
was
the
first
altar
that
he
built
unto
the
lord
and
saul
said
let
us
go
down
after
the
philistines
by
night
and
spoil
them
until
the
morning
light
and
let
us
not
leave
a
man
of
them
and
they
said
do
whatsoever
seemeth
good
unto
thee
then
said
the
priest
let
us
draw
near
hither
unto
god
and
saul
asked
counsel
of
god
shall
i
go
down
after
the
philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
israel
but
he
answered
him
not
that
day
and
saul
said
draw
ye
near
hither
all
the
chief
of
the
people
and
know
and
see
wherein
this
sin
hath
been
this
day
for
as
the
lord
liveth
which
saveth
israel
though
it
be
in
jonathan
my
son
he
shall
surely
die
but
there
was
not
a
man
among
all
the
people
that
answered
him
then
said
he
unto
all
israel
be
ye
on
one
side
and
i
and
jonathan
my
son
will
be
on
the
other
side
and
the
people
said
unto
saul
do
what
seemeth
good
unto
thee
therefore
saul
said
unto
the
lord
god
of
israel
give
a
perfect
lot
and
saul
and
jonathan
were
taken
but
the
people
escaped
and
saul
said
cast
lots
between
me
and
jonathan
my
son
and
jonathan
was
taken
then
saul
said
to
jonathan
tell
me
what
thou
hast
done
and
jonathan
told
him
and
said
i
did
but
taste
a
little
honey
with
the
end
of
the
rod
that
was
in
mine
hand
and
lo
i
must
die
and
saul
answered
god
do
so
and
more
also
for
thou
shalt
surely
die
jonathan
and
the
people
said
unto
saul
shall
jonathan
die
who
hath
wrought
this
great
salvation
in
israel
god
forbid
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
his
head
fall
to
the
ground
for
he
hath
wrought
with
god
this
day
so
the
people
rescued
jonathan
that
he
died
not
then
saul
went
up
from
following
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
went
to
their
own
place
so
saul
took
the
kingdom
over
israel
and
fought
against
all
his
enemies
on
every
side
against
moab
and
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
against
edom
and
against
the
kings
of
zobah
and
against
the
philistines
and
whithersoever
he
turned
himself
he
vexed
them
and
he
gathered
an
host
and
smote
the
amalekites
and
delivered
israel
out
of
the
hands
of
them
that
spoiled
them
now
the
sons
of
saul
were
jonathan
and
ishui
and
melchishua
and
the
names
of
his
two
daughters
were
these
the
name
of
the
firstborn
merab
and
the
name
of
the
younger
michal
and
the
name
of
saul's
wife
was
ahinoam
the
daughter
of
ahimaaz
and
the
name
of
the
captain
of
his
host
was
abner
the
son
of
ner
saul's
uncle
and
kish
was
the
father
of
saul
and
ner
the
father
of
abner
was
the
son
of
abiel
and
there
was
sore
war
against
the
philistines
all
the
days
of
saul
and
when
saul
saw
any
strong
man
or
any
valiant
man
he
took
him
unto
him
samuel
also
said
unto
saul
the
lord
sent
me
to
anoint
thee
to
be
king
over
his
people
over
israel
now
therefore
hearken
thou
unto
the
voice
of
the
words
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
remember
that
which
amalek
did
to
israel
how
he
laid
wait
for
him
in
the
way
when
he
came
up
from
egypt
now
go
and
smite
amalek
and
utterly
destroy
all
that
they
have
and
spare
them
not
but
slay
both
man
and
woman
infant
and
suckling
ox
and
sheep
camel
and
ass
and
saul
gathered
the
people
together
and
numbered
them
in
telaim
two
hundred
thousand
footmen
and
ten
thousand
men
of
judah
and
saul
came
to
a
city
of
amalek
and
laid
wait
in
the
valley
and
saul
said
unto
the
kenites
go
depart
get
you
down
from
among
the
amalekites
lest
i
destroy
you
with
them
for
ye
shewed
kindness
to
all
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
up
out
of
egypt
so
the
kenites
departed
from
among
the
amalekites
and
saul
smote
the
amalekites
from
havilah
until
thou
comest
to
shur
that
is
over
against
egypt
and
he
took
agag
the
king
of
the
amalekites
alive
and
utterly
destroyed
all
the
people
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
saul
and
the
people
spared
agag
and
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
oxen
and
of
the
fatlings
and
the
lambs
and
all
that
was
good
and
would
not
utterly
destroy
them
but
every
thing
that
was
vile
and
refuse
that
they
destroyed
utterly
then
came
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
samuel
saying
it
repenteth
me
that
i
have
set
up
saul
to
be
king
for
he
is
turned
back
from
following
me
and
hath
not
performed
my
commandments
and
it
grieved
samuel
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
all
night
and
when
samuel
rose
early
to
meet
saul
in
the
morning
it
was
told
samuel
saying
saul
came
to
carmel
and
behold
he
set
him
up
a
place
and
is
gone
about
and
passed
on
and
gone
down
to
gilgal
and
samuel
came
to
saul
and
saul
said
unto
him
blessed
be
thou
of
the
lord
i
have
performed
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
samuel
said
what
meaneth
then
this
bleating
of
the
sheep
in
mine
ears
and
the
lowing
of
the
oxen
which
i
hear
and
saul
said
they
have
brought
them
from
the
amalekites
for
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
sheep
and
of
the
oxen
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
rest
we
have
utterly
destroyed
then
samuel
said
unto
saul
stay
and
i
will
tell
thee
what
the
lord
hath
said
to
me
this
night
and
he
said
unto
him
say
on
and
samuel
said
when
thou
wast
little
in
thine
own
sight
wast
thou
not
made
the
head
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
the
lord
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
and
the
lord
sent
thee
on
a
journey
and
said
go
and
utterly
destroy
the
sinners
the
amalekites
and
fight
against
them
until
they
be
consumed
wherefore
then
didst
thou
not
obey
the
voice
of
the
lord
but
didst
fly
upon
the
spoil
and
didst
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
saul
said
unto
samuel
yea
i
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
have
gone
the
way
which
the
lord
sent
me
and
have
brought
agag
the
king
of
amalek
and
have
utterly
destroyed
the
amalekites
but
the
people
took
of
the
spoil
sheep
and
oxen
the
chief
of
the
things
which
should
have
been
utterly
destroyed
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
thy
god
in
gilgal
and
samuel
said
hath
the
lord
as
great
delight
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
the
lord
behold
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
rams
for
rebellion
is
as
the
sin
of
witchcraft
and
stubbornness
is
as
iniquity
and
idolatry
because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
he
hath
also
rejected
thee
from
being
king
and
saul
said
unto
samuel
i
have
sinned
for
i
have
transgressed
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
thy
words
because
i
feared
the
people
and
obeyed
their
voice
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
pardon
my
sin
and
turn
again
with
me
that
i
may
worship
the
lord
and
samuel
said
unto
saul
i
will
not
return
with
thee
for
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
hath
rejected
thee
from
being
king
over
israel
and
as
samuel
turned
about
to
go
away
he
laid
hold
upon
the
skirt
of
his
mantle
and
it
rent
and
samuel
said
unto
him
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
of
israel
from
thee
this
day
and
hath
given
it
to
a
neighbour
of
thine
that
is
better
than
thou
and
also
the
strength
of
israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent
for
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
repent
then
he
said
i
have
sinned
yet
honour
me
now
i
pray
thee
before
the
elders
of
my
people
and
before
israel
and
turn
again
with
me
that
i
may
worship
the
lord
thy
god
so
samuel
turned
again
after
saul
and
saul
worshipped
the
lord
then
said
samuel
bring
ye
hither
to
me
agag
the
king
of
the
amalekites
and
agag
came
unto
him
delicately
and
agag
said
surely
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past
and
samuel
said
as
the
sword
hath
made
women
childless
so
shall
thy
mother
be
childless
among
women
and
samuel
hewed
agag
in
pieces
before
the
lord
in
gilgal
then
samuel
went
to
ramah
and
saul
went
up
to
his
house
to
gibeah
of
saul
and
samuel
came
no
more
to
see
saul
until
the
day
of
his
death
nevertheless
samuel
mourned
for
saul
and
the
lord
repented
that
he
had
made
saul
king
over
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
how
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
saul
seeing
i
have
rejected
him
from
reigning
over
israel
fill
thine
horn
with
oil
and
go
i
will
send
thee
to
jesse
the
bethlehemite
for
i
have
provided
me
a
king
among
his
sons
and
samuel
said
how
can
i
go
if
saul
hear
it
he
will
kill
me
and
the
lord
said
take
an
heifer
with
thee
and
say
i
am
come
to
sacrifice
to
the
lord
and
call
jesse
to
the
sacrifice
and
i
will
shew
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
and
thou
shalt
anoint
unto
me
him
whom
i
name
unto
thee
and
samuel
did
that
which
the
lord
spake
and
came
to
bethlehem
and
the
elders
of
the
town
trembled
at
his
coming
and
said
comest
thou
peaceably
and
he
said
peaceably
i
am
come
to
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
sanctify
yourselves
and
come
with
me
to
the
sacrifice
and
he
sanctified
jesse
and
his
sons
and
called
them
to
the
sacrifice
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
that
he
looked
on
eliab
and
said
surely
the
lord's
anointed
is
before
him
but
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
look
not
on
his
countenance
or
on
the
height
of
his
stature
because
i
have
refused
him
for
the
lord
seeth
not
as
man
seeth
for
man
looketh
on
the
outward
appearance
but
the
lord
looketh
on
the
heart
then
jesse
called
abinadab
and
made
him
pass
before
samuel
and
he
said
neither
hath
the
lord
chosen
this
then
jesse
made
shammah
to
pass
by
and
he
said
neither
hath
the
lord
chosen
this
again
jesse
made
seven
of
his
sons
to
pass
before
samuel
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
the
lord
hath
not
chosen
these
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
are
here
all
thy
children
and
he
said
there
remaineth
yet
the
youngest
and
behold
he
keepeth
the
sheep
and
samuel
said
unto
jesse
send
and
fetch
him
for
we
will
not
sit
down
till
he
come
hither
and
he
sent
and
brought
him
in
now
he
was
ruddy
and
withal
of
a
beautiful
countenance
and
goodly
to
look
to
and
the
lord
said
arise
anoint
him
for
this
is
he
then
samuel
took
the
horn
of
oil
and
anointed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
brethren
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
david
from
that
day
forward
so
samuel
rose
up
and
went
to
ramah
but
the
spirit
of
the
lord
departed
from
saul
and
an
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
troubled
him
and
saul's
servants
said
unto
him
behold
now
an
evil
spirit
from
god
troubleth
thee
let
our
lord
now
command
thy
servants
which
are
before
thee
to
seek
out
a
man
who
is
a
cunning
player
on
an
harp
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
god
is
upon
thee
that
he
shall
play
with
his
hand
and
thou
shalt
be
well
and
saul
said
unto
his
servants
provide
me
now
a
man
that
can
play
well
and
bring
him
to
me
then
answered
one
of
the
servants
and
said
behold
i
have
seen
a
son
of
jesse
the
bethlehemite
that
is
cunning
in
playing
and
a
mighty
valiant
man
and
a
man
of
war
and
prudent
in
matters
and
a
comely
person
and
the
lord
is
with
him
wherefore
saul
sent
messengers
unto
jesse
and
said
send
me
david
thy
son
which
is
with
the
sheep
and
jesse
took
an
ass
laden
with
bread
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
kid
and
sent
them
by
david
his
son
unto
saul
and
david
came
to
saul
and
stood
before
him
and
he
loved
him
greatly
and
he
became
his
armourbearer
and
saul
sent
to
jesse
saying
let
david
i
pray
thee
stand
before
me
for
he
hath
found
favour
in
my
sight
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
evil
spirit
from
god
was
upon
saul
that
david
took
an
harp
and
played
with
his
hand
so
saul
was
refreshed
and
was
well
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
him
now
the
philistines
gathered
together
their
armies
to
battle
and
were
gathered
together
at
shochoh
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
pitched
between
shochoh
and
azekah
in
ephesdammim
and
saul
and
the
men
of
israel
were
gathered
together
and
pitched
by
the
valley
of
elah
and
set
the
battle
in
array
against
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
one
side
and
israel
stood
on
a
mountain
on
the
other
side
and
there
was
a
valley
between
them
and
there
went
out
a
champion
out
of
the
camp
of
the
philistines
named
goliath
of
gath
whose
height
was
six
cubits
and
a
span
and
he
had
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head
and
he
was
armed
with
a
coat
of
mail
and
the
weight
of
the
coat
was
five
thousand
shekels
of
brass
and
he
had
greaves
of
brass
upon
his
legs
and
a
target
of
brass
between
his
shoulders
and
the
staff
of
his
spear
was
like
a
weaver's
beam
and
his
spear's
head
weighed
six
hundred
shekels
of
iron
and
one
bearing
a
shield
went
before
him
and
he
stood
and
cried
unto
the
armies
of
israel
and
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
come
out
to
set
your
battle
in
array
am
not
i
a
philistine
and
ye
servants
to
saul
choose
you
a
man
for
you
and
let
him
come
down
to
me
if
he
be
able
to
fight
with
me
and
to
kill
me
then
will
we
be
your
servants
but
if
i
prevail
against
him
and
kill
him
then
shall
ye
be
our
servants
and
serve
us
and
the
philistine
said
i
defy
the
armies
of
israel
this
day
give
me
a
man
that
we
may
fight
together
when
saul
and
all
israel
heard
those
words
of
the
philistine
they
were
dismayed
and
greatly
afraid
now
david
was
the
son
of
that
ephrathite
of
bethlehemjudah
whose
name
was
jesse
and
he
had
eight
sons
and
the
man
went
among
men
for
an
old
man
in
the
days
of
saul
and
the
three
eldest
sons
of
jesse
went
and
followed
saul
to
the
battle
and
the
names
of
his
three
sons
that
went
to
the
battle
were
eliab
the
firstborn
and
next
unto
him
abinadab
and
the
third
shammah
and
david
was
the
youngest
and
the
three
eldest
followed
saul
but
david
went
and
returned
from
saul
to
feed
his
father's
sheep
at
bethlehem
and
the
philistine
drew
near
morning
and
evening
and
presented
himself
forty
days
and
jesse
said
unto
david
his
son
take
now
for
thy
brethren
an
ephah
of
this
parched
corn
and
these
ten
loaves
and
run
to
the
camp
of
thy
brethren
and
carry
these
ten
cheeses
unto
the
captain
of
their
thousand
and
look
how
thy
brethren
fare
and
take
their
pledge
now
saul
and
they
and
all
the
men
of
israel
were
in
the
valley
of
elah
fighting
with
the
philistines
and
david
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
left
the
sheep
with
a
keeper
and
took
and
went
as
jesse
had
commanded
him
and
he
came
to
the
trench
as
the
host
was
going
forth
to
the
fight
and
shouted
for
the
battle
for
israel
and
the
philistines
had
put
the
battle
in
array
army
against
army
and
david
left
his
carriage
in
the
hand
of
the
keeper
of
the
carriage
and
ran
into
the
army
and
came
and
saluted
his
brethren
and
as
he
talked
with
them
behold
there
came
up
the
champion
the
philistine
of
gath
goliath
by
name
out
of
the
armies
of
the
philistines
and
spake
according
to
the
same
words
and
david
heard
them
and
all
the
men
of
israel
when
they
saw
the
man
fled
from
him
and
were
sore
afraid
and
the
men
of
israel
said
have
ye
seen
this
man
that
is
come
up
surely
to
defy
israel
is
he
come
up
and
it
shall
be
that
the
man
who
killeth
him
the
king
will
enrich
him
with
great
riches
and
will
give
him
his
daughter
and
make
his
father's
house
free
in
israel
and
david
spake
to
the
men
that
stood
by
him
saying
what
shall
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
this
philistine
and
taketh
away
the
reproach
from
israel
for
who
is
this
uncircumcised
philistine
that
he
should
defy
the
armies
of
the
living
god
and
the
people
answered
him
after
this
manner
saying
so
shall
it
be
done
to
the
man
that
killeth
him
and
eliab
his
eldest
brother
heard
when
he
spake
unto
the
men
and
eliab's
anger
was
kindled
against
david
and
he
said
why
camest
thou
down
hither
and
with
whom
hast
thou
left
those
few
sheep
in
the
wilderness
i
know
thy
pride
and
the
naughtiness
of
thine
heart
for
thou
art
come
down
that
thou
mightest
see
the
battle
and
david
said
what
have
i
now
done
is
there
not
a
cause
and
he
turned
from
him
toward
another
and
spake
after
the
same
manner
and
the
people
answered
him
again
after
the
former
manner
and
when
the
words
were
heard
which
david
spake
they
rehearsed
them
before
saul
and
he
sent
for
him
and
david
said
to
saul
let
no
man's
heart
fail
because
of
him
thy
servant
will
go
and
fight
with
this
philistine
and
saul
said
to
david
thou
art
not
able
to
go
against
this
philistine
to
fight
with
him
for
thou
art
but
a
youth
and
he
a
man
of
war
from
his
youth
and
david
said
unto
saul
thy
servant
kept
his
father's
sheep
and
there
came
a
lion
and
a
bear
and
took
a
lamb
out
of
the
flock
and
i
went
out
after
him
and
smote
him
and
delivered
it
out
of
his
mouth
and
when
he
arose
against
me
i
caught
him
by
his
beard
and
smote
him
and
slew
him
thy
servant
slew
both
the
lion
and
the
bear
and
this
uncircumcised
philistine
shall
be
as
one
of
them
seeing
he
hath
defied
the
armies
of
the
living
god
david
said
moreover
the
lord
that
delivered
me
out
of
the
paw
of
the
lion
and
out
of
the
paw
of
the
bear
he
will
deliver
me
out
of
the
hand
of
this
philistine
and
saul
said
unto
david
go
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
and
saul
armed
david
with
his
armour
and
he
put
an
helmet
of
brass
upon
his
head
also
he
armed
him
with
a
coat
of
mail
and
david
girded
his
sword
upon
his
armour
and
he
assayed
to
go
for
he
had
not
proved
it
and
david
said
unto
saul
i
cannot
go
with
these
for
i
have
not
proved
them
and
david
put
them
off
him
and
he
took
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
chose
him
five
smooth
stones
out
of
the
brook
and
put
them
in
a
shepherd's
bag
which
he
had
even
in
a
scrip
and
his
sling
was
in
his
hand
and
he
drew
near
to
the
philistine
and
the
philistine
came
on
and
drew
near
unto
david
and
the
man
that
bare
the
shield
went
before
him
and
when
the
philistine
looked
about
and
saw
david
he
disdained
him
for
he
was
but
a
youth
and
ruddy
and
of
a
fair
countenance
and
the
philistine
said
unto
david
am
i
a
dog
that
thou
comest
to
me
with
staves
and
the
philistine
cursed
david
by
his
gods
and
the
philistine
said
to
david
come
to
me
and
i
will
give
thy
flesh
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
then
said
david
to
the
philistine
thou
comest
to
me
with
a
sword
and
with
a
spear
and
with
a
shield
but
i
come
to
thee
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
the
god
of
the
armies
of
israel
whom
thou
hast
defied
this
day
will
the
lord
deliver
thee
into
mine
hand
and
i
will
smite
thee
and
take
thine
head
from
thee
and
i
will
give
the
carcases
of
the
host
of
the
philistines
this
day
unto
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
that
all
the
earth
may
know
that
there
is
a
god
in
israel
and
all
this
assembly
shall
know
that
the
lord
saveth
not
with
sword
and
spear
for
the
battle
is
the
lord's
and
he
will
give
you
into
our
hands
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
philistine
arose
and
came
and
drew
nigh
to
meet
david
that
david
hastened
and
ran
toward
the
army
to
meet
the
philistine
and
david
put
his
hand
in
his
bag
and
took
thence
a
stone
and
slang
it
and
smote
the
philistine
in
his
forehead
that
the
stone
sunk
into
his
forehead
and
he
fell
upon
his
face
to
the
earth
so
david
prevailed
over
the
philistine
with
a
sling
and
with
a
stone
and
smote
the
philistine
and
slew
him
but
there
was
no
sword
in
the
hand
of
david
therefore
david
ran
and
stood
upon
the
philistine
and
took
his
sword
and
drew
it
out
of
the
sheath
thereof
and
slew
him
and
cut
off
his
head
therewith
and
when
the
philistines
saw
their
champion
was
dead
they
fled
and
the
men
of
israel
and
of
judah
arose
and
shouted
and
pursued
the
philistines
until
thou
come
to
the
valley
and
to
the
gates
of
ekron
and
the
wounded
of
the
philistines
fell
down
by
the
way
to
shaaraim
even
unto
gath
and
unto
ekron
and
the
children
of
israel
returned
from
chasing
after
the
philistines
and
they
spoiled
their
tents
and
david
took
the
head
of
the
philistine
and
brought
it
to
jerusalem
but
he
put
his
armour
in
his
tent
and
when
saul
saw
david
go
forth
against
the
philistine
he
said
unto
abner
the
captain
of
the
host
abner
whose
son
is
this
youth
and
abner
said
as
thy
soul
liveth
o
king
i
cannot
tell
and
the
king
said
enquire
thou
whose
son
the
stripling
is
and
as
david
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
philistine
abner
took
him
and
brought
him
before
saul
with
the
head
of
the
philistine
in
his
hand
and
saul
said
to
him
whose
son
art
thou
thou
young
man
and
david
answered
i
am
the
son
of
thy
servant
jesse
the
bethlehemite
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
saul
that
the
soul
of
jonathan
was
knit
with
the
soul
of
david
and
jonathan
loved
him
as
his
own
soul
and
saul
took
him
that
day
and
would
let
him
go
no
more
home
to
his
father's
house
then
jonathan
and
david
made
a
covenant
because
he
loved
him
as
his
own
soul
and
jonathan
stripped
himself
of
the
robe
that
was
upon
him
and
gave
it
to
david
and
his
garments
even
to
his
sword
and
to
his
bow
and
to
his
girdle
and
david
went
out
whithersoever
saul
sent
him
and
behaved
himself
wisely
and
saul
set
him
over
the
men
of
war
and
he
was
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
and
also
in
the
sight
of
saul's
servants
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
came
when
david
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
philistine
that
the
women
came
out
of
all
cities
of
israel
singing
and
dancing
to
meet
king
saul
with
tabrets
with
joy
and
with
instruments
of
musick
and
the
women
answered
one
another
as
they
played
and
said
saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
and
saul
was
very
wroth
and
the
saying
displeased
him
and
he
said
they
have
ascribed
unto
david
ten
thousands
and
to
me
they
have
ascribed
but
thousands
and
what
can
he
have
more
but
the
kingdom
and
saul
eyed
david
from
that
day
and
forward
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
evil
spirit
from
god
came
upon
saul
and
he
prophesied
in
the
midst
of
the
house
and
david
played
with
his
hand
as
at
other
times
and
there
was
a
javelin
in
saul's
hand
and
saul
cast
the
javelin
for
he
said
i
will
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
with
it
and
david
avoided
out
of
his
presence
twice
and
saul
was
afraid
of
david
because
the
lord
was
with
him
and
was
departed
from
saul
therefore
saul
removed
him
from
him
and
made
him
his
captain
over
a
thousand
and
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
the
people
and
david
behaved
himself
wisely
in
all
his
ways
and
the
lord
was
with
him
wherefore
when
saul
saw
that
he
behaved
himself
very
wisely
he
was
afraid
of
him
but
all
israel
and
judah
loved
david
because
he
went
out
and
came
in
before
them
and
saul
said
to
david
behold
my
elder
daughter
merab
her
will
i
give
thee
to
wife
only
be
thou
valiant
for
me
and
fight
the
lord's
battles
for
saul
said
let
not
mine
hand
be
upon
him
but
let
the
hand
of
the
philistines
be
upon
him
and
david
said
unto
saul
who
am
i
and
what
is
my
life
or
my
father's
family
in
israel
that
i
should
be
son
in
law
to
the
king
but
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
when
merab
saul's
daughter
should
have
been
given
to
david
that
she
was
given
unto
adriel
the
meholathite
to
wife
and
michal
saul's
daughter
loved
david
and
they
told
saul
and
the
thing
pleased
him
and
saul
said
i
will
give
him
her
that
she
may
be
a
snare
to
him
and
that
the
hand
of
the
philistines
may
be
against
him
wherefore
saul
said
to
david
thou
shalt
this
day
be
my
son
in
law
in
the
one
of
the
twain
and
saul
commanded
his
servants
saying
commune
with
david
secretly
and
say
behold
the
king
hath
delight
in
thee
and
all
his
servants
love
thee
now
therefore
be
the
king's
son
in
law
and
saul's
servants
spake
those
words
in
the
ears
of
david
and
david
said
seemeth
it
to
you
a
light
thing
to
be
a
king's
son
in
law
seeing
that
i
am
a
poor
man
and
lightly
esteemed
and
the
servants
of
saul
told
him
saying
on
this
manner
spake
david
and
saul
said
thus
shall
ye
say
to
david
the
king
desireth
not
any
dowry
but
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
philistines
to
be
avenged
of
the
king's
enemies
but
saul
thought
to
make
david
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
when
his
servants
told
david
these
words
it
pleased
david
well
to
be
the
king's
son
in
law
and
the
days
were
not
expired
wherefore
david
arose
and
went
he
and
his
men
and
slew
of
the
philistines
two
hundred
men
and
david
brought
their
foreskins
and
they
gave
them
in
full
tale
to
the
king
that
he
might
be
the
king's
son
in
law
and
saul
gave
him
michal
his
daughter
to
wife
and
saul
saw
and
knew
that
the
lord
was
with
david
and
that
michal
saul's
daughter
loved
him
and
saul
was
yet
the
more
afraid
of
david
and
saul
became
david's
enemy
continually
then
the
princes
of
the
philistines
went
forth
and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
went
forth
that
david
behaved
himself
more
wisely
than
all
the
servants
of
saul
so
that
his
name
was
much
set
by
and
saul
spake
to
jonathan
his
son
and
to
all
his
servants
that
they
should
kill
david
but
jonathan
saul's
son
delighted
much
in
david
and
jonathan
told
david
saying
saul
my
father
seeketh
to
kill
thee
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
take
heed
to
thyself
until
the
morning
and
abide
in
a
secret
place
and
hide
thyself
and
i
will
go
out
and
stand
beside
my
father
in
the
field
where
thou
art
and
i
will
commune
with
my
father
of
thee
and
what
i
see
that
i
will
tell
thee
and
jonathan
spake
good
of
david
unto
saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
let
not
the
king
sin
against
his
servant
against
david
because
he
hath
not
sinned
against
thee
and
because
his
works
have
been
to
thee-ward
very
good
for
he
did
put
his
life
in
his
hand
and
slew
the
philistine
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
salvation
for
all
israel
thou
sawest
it
and
didst
rejoice
wherefore
then
wilt
thou
sin
against
innocent
blood
to
slay
david
without
a
cause
and
saul
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
jonathan
and
saul
sware
as
the
lord
liveth
he
shall
not
be
slain
and
jonathan
called
david
and
jonathan
shewed
him
all
those
things
and
jonathan
brought
david
to
saul
and
he
was
in
his
presence
as
in
times
past
and
there
was
war
again
and
david
went
out
and
fought
with
the
philistines
and
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
and
they
fled
from
him
and
the
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
was
upon
saul
as
he
sat
in
his
house
with
his
javelin
in
his
hand
and
david
played
with
his
hand
and
saul
sought
to
smite
david
even
to
the
wall
with
the
javelin
but
he
slipped
away
out
of
saul's
presence
and
he
smote
the
javelin
into
the
wall
and
david
fled
and
escaped
that
night
saul
also
sent
messengers
unto
david's
house
to
watch
him
and
to
slay
him
in
the
morning
and
michal
david's
wife
told
him
saying
if
thou
save
not
thy
life
to
night
to
morrow
thou
shalt
be
slain
so
michal
let
david
down
through
a
window
and
he
went
and
fled
and
escaped
and
michal
took
an
image
and
laid
it
in
the
bed
and
put
a
pillow
of
goats
hair
for
his
bolster
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth
and
when
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
david
she
said
he
is
sick
and
saul
sent
the
messengers
again
to
see
david
saying
bring
him
up
to
me
in
the
bed
that
i
may
slay
him
and
when
the
messengers
were
come
in
behold
there
was
an
image
in
the
bed
with
a
pillow
of
goats
hair
for
his
bolster
and
saul
said
unto
michal
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
so
and
sent
away
mine
enemy
that
he
is
escaped
and
michal
answered
saul
he
said
unto
me
let
me
go
why
should
i
kill
thee
so
david
fled
and
escaped
and
came
to
samuel
to
ramah
and
told
him
all
that
saul
had
done
to
him
and
he
and
samuel
went
and
dwelt
in
naioth
and
it
was
told
saul
saying
behold
david
is
at
naioth
in
ramah
and
saul
sent
messengers
to
take
david
and
when
they
saw
the
company
of
the
prophets
prophesying
and
samuel
standing
as
appointed
over
them
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
the
messengers
of
saul
and
they
also
prophesied
and
when
it
was
told
saul
he
sent
other
messengers
and
they
prophesied
likewise
and
saul
sent
messengers
again
the
third
time
and
they
prophesied
also
then
went
he
also
to
ramah
and
came
to
a
great
well
that
is
in
sechu
and
he
asked
and
said
where
are
samuel
and
david
and
one
said
behold
they
be
at
naioth
in
ramah
and
he
went
thither
to
naioth
in
ramah
and
the
spirit
of
god
was
upon
him
also
and
he
went
on
and
prophesied
until
he
came
to
naioth
in
ramah
and
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
also
and
prophesied
before
samuel
in
like
manner
and
lay
down
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
wherefore
they
say
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
and
david
fled
from
naioth
in
ramah
and
came
and
said
before
jonathan
what
have
i
done
what
is
mine
iniquity
and
what
is
my
sin
before
thy
father
that
he
seeketh
my
life
and
he
said
unto
him
god
forbid
thou
shalt
not
die
behold
my
father
will
do
nothing
either
great
or
small
but
that
he
will
shew
it
me
and
why
should
my
father
hide
this
thing
from
me
it
is
not
so
and
david
sware
moreover
and
said
thy
father
certainly
knoweth
that
i
have
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
and
he
saith
let
not
jonathan
know
this
lest
he
be
grieved
but
truly
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
there
is
but
a
step
between
me
and
death
then
said
jonathan
unto
david
whatsoever
thy
soul
desireth
i
will
even
do
it
for
thee
and
david
said
unto
jonathan
behold
to
morrow
is
the
new
moon
and
i
should
not
fail
to
sit
with
the
king
at
meat
but
let
me
go
that
i
may
hide
myself
in
the
field
unto
the
third
day
at
even
if
thy
father
at
all
miss
me
then
say
david
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
that
he
might
run
to
bethlehem
his
city
for
there
is
a
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
family
if
he
say
thus
it
is
well
thy
servant
shall
have
peace
but
if
he
be
very
wroth
then
be
sure
that
evil
is
determined
by
him
therefore
thou
shalt
deal
kindly
with
thy
servant
for
thou
hast
brought
thy
servant
into
a
covenant
of
the
lord
with
thee
notwithstanding
if
there
be
in
me
iniquity
slay
me
thyself
for
why
shouldest
thou
bring
me
to
thy
father
and
jonathan
said
far
be
it
from
thee
for
if
i
knew
certainly
that
evil
were
determined
by
my
father
to
come
upon
thee
then
would
not
i
tell
it
thee
then
said
david
to
jonathan
who
shall
tell
me
or
what
if
thy
father
answer
thee
roughly
and
jonathan
said
unto
david
come
and
let
us
go
out
into
the
field
and
they
went
out
both
of
them
into
the
field
and
jonathan
said
unto
david
o
lord
god
of
israel
when
i
have
sounded
my
father
about
to
morrow
any
time
or
the
third
day
and
behold
if
there
be
good
toward
david
and
i
then
send
not
unto
thee
and
shew
it
thee
the
lord
do
so
and
much
more
to
jonathan
but
if
it
please
my
father
to
do
thee
evil
then
i
will
shew
it
thee
and
send
thee
away
that
thou
mayest
go
in
peace
and
the
lord
be
with
thee
as
he
hath
been
with
my
father
and
thou
shalt
not
only
while
yet
i
live
shew
me
the
kindness
of
the
lord
that
i
die
not
but
also
thou
shalt
not
cut
off
thy
kindness
from
my
house
for
ever
no
not
when
the
lord
hath
cut
off
the
enemies
of
david
every
one
from
the
face
of
the
earth
so
jonathan
made
a
covenant
with
the
house
of
david
saying
let
the
lord
even
require
it
at
the
hand
of
david's
enemies
and
jonathan
caused
david
to
swear
again
because
he
loved
him
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
his
own
soul
then
jonathan
said
to
david
to
morrow
is
the
new
moon
and
thou
shalt
be
missed
because
thy
seat
will
be
empty
and
when
thou
hast
stayed
three
days
then
thou
shalt
go
down
quickly
and
come
to
the
place
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
when
the
business
was
in
hand
and
shalt
remain
by
the
stone
ezel
and
i
will
shoot
three
arrows
on
the
side
thereof
as
though
i
shot
at
a
mark
and
behold
i
will
send
a
lad
saying
go
find
out
the
arrows
if
i
expressly
say
unto
the
lad
behold
the
arrows
are
on
this
side
of
thee
take
them
then
come
thou
for
there
is
peace
to
thee
and
no
hurt
as
the
lord
liveth
but
if
i
say
thus
unto
the
young
man
behold
the
arrows
are
beyond
thee
go
thy
way
for
the
lord
hath
sent
thee
away
and
as
touching
the
matter
which
thou
and
i
have
spoken
of
behold
the
lord
be
between
thee
and
me
for
ever
so
david
hid
himself
in
the
field
and
when
the
new
moon
was
come
the
king
sat
him
down
to
eat
meat
and
the
king
sat
upon
his
seat
as
at
other
times
even
upon
a
seat
by
the
wall
and
jonathan
arose
and
abner
sat
by
saul's
side
and
david's
place
was
empty
nevertheless
saul
spake
not
any
thing
that
day
for
he
thought
something
hath
befallen
him
he
is
not
clean
surely
he
is
not
clean
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
which
was
the
second
day
of
the
month
that
david's
place
was
empty
and
saul
said
unto
jonathan
his
son
wherefore
cometh
not
the
son
of
jesse
to
meat
neither
yesterday
nor
to
day
and
jonathan
answered
saul
david
earnestly
asked
leave
of
me
to
go
to
bethlehem
and
he
said
let
me
go
i
pray
thee
for
our
family
hath
a
sacrifice
in
the
city
and
my
brother
he
hath
commanded
me
to
be
there
and
now
if
i
have
found
favour
in
thine
eyes
let
me
get
away
i
pray
thee
and
see
my
brethren
therefore
he
cometh
not
unto
the
king's
table
then
saul's
anger
was
kindled
against
jonathan
and
he
said
unto
him
thou
son
of
the
perverse
rebellious
woman
do
not
i
know
that
thou
hast
chosen
the
son
of
jesse
to
thine
own
confusion
and
unto
the
confusion
of
thy
mother's
nakedness
for
as
long
as
the
son
of
jesse
liveth
upon
the
ground
thou
shalt
not
be
established
nor
thy
kingdom
wherefore
now
send
and
fetch
him
unto
me
for
he
shall
surely
die
and
jonathan
answered
saul
his
father
and
said
unto
him
wherefore
shall
he
be
slain
what
hath
he
done
and
saul
cast
a
javelin
at
him
to
smite
him
whereby
jonathan
knew
that
it
was
determined
of
his
father
to
slay
david
so
jonathan
arose
from
the
table
in
fierce
anger
and
did
eat
no
meat
the
second
day
of
the
month
for
he
was
grieved
for
david
because
his
father
had
done
him
shame
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
jonathan
went
out
into
the
field
at
the
time
appointed
with
david
and
a
little
lad
with
him
and
he
said
unto
his
lad
run
find
out
now
the
arrows
which
i
shoot
and
as
the
lad
ran
he
shot
an
arrow
beyond
him
and
when
the
lad
was
come
to
the
place
of
the
arrow
which
jonathan
had
shot
jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
and
said
is
not
the
arrow
beyond
thee
and
jonathan
cried
after
the
lad
make
speed
haste
stay
not
and
jonathan's
lad
gathered
up
the
arrows
and
came
to
his
master
but
the
lad
knew
not
any
thing
only
jonathan
and
david
knew
the
matter
and
jonathan
gave
his
artillery
unto
his
lad
and
said
unto
him
go
carry
them
to
the
city
and
as
soon
as
the
lad
was
gone
david
arose
out
of
a
place
toward
the
south
and
fell
on
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
three
times
and
they
kissed
one
another
and
wept
one
with
another
until
david
exceeded
and
jonathan
said
to
david
go
in
peace
forasmuch
as
we
have
sworn
both
of
us
in
the
name
of
the
lord
saying
the
lord
be
between
me
and
thee
and
between
my
seed
and
thy
seed
for
ever
and
he
arose
and
departed
and
jonathan
went
into
the
city
then
came
david
to
nob
to
ahimelech
the
priest
and
ahimelech
was
afraid
at
the
meeting
of
david
and
said
unto
him
why
art
thou
alone
and
no
man
with
thee
and
david
said
unto
ahimelech
the
priest
the
king
hath
commanded
me
a
business
and
hath
said
unto
me
let
no
man
know
any
thing
of
the
business
whereabout
i
send
thee
and
what
i
have
commanded
thee
and
i
have
appointed
my
servants
to
such
and
such
a
place
now
therefore
what
is
under
thine
hand
give
me
five
loaves
of
bread
in
mine
hand
or
what
there
is
present
and
the
priest
answered
david
and
said
there
is
no
common
bread
under
mine
hand
but
there
is
hallowed
bread
if
the
young
men
have
kept
themselves
at
least
from
women
and
david
answered
the
priest
and
said
unto
him
of
a
truth
women
have
been
kept
from
us
about
these
three
days
since
i
came
out
and
the
vessels
of
the
young
men
are
holy
and
the
bread
is
in
a
manner
common
yea
though
it
were
sanctified
this
day
in
the
vessel
so
the
priest
gave
him
hallowed
bread
for
there
was
no
bread
there
but
the
shewbread
that
was
taken
from
before
the
lord
to
put
hot
bread
in
the
day
when
it
was
taken
away
now
a
certain
man
of
the
servants
of
saul
was
there
that
day
detained
before
the
lord
and
his
name
was
doeg
an
edomite
the
chiefest
of
the
herdmen
that
belonged
to
saul
and
david
said
unto
ahimelech
and
is
there
not
here
under
thine
hand
spear
or
sword
for
i
have
neither
brought
my
sword
nor
my
weapons
with
me
because
the
king's
business
required
haste
and
the
priest
said
the
sword
of
goliath
the
philistine
whom
thou
slewest
in
the
valley
of
elah
behold
it
is
here
wrapped
in
a
cloth
behind
the
ephod
if
thou
wilt
take
that
take
it
for
there
is
no
other
save
that
here
and
david
said
there
is
none
like
that
give
it
me
and
david
arose
and
fled
that
day
for
fear
of
saul
and
went
to
achish
the
king
of
gath
and
the
servants
of
achish
said
unto
him
is
not
this
david
the
king
of
the
land
did
they
not
sing
one
to
another
of
him
in
dances
saying
saul
hath
slain
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
and
david
laid
up
these
words
in
his
heart
and
was
sore
afraid
of
achish
the
king
of
gath
and
he
changed
his
behaviour
before
them
and
feigned
himself
mad
in
their
hands
and
scrabbled
on
the
doors
of
the
gate
and
let
his
spittle
fall
down
upon
his
beard
then
said
achish
unto
his
servants
lo
ye
see
the
man
is
mad
wherefore
then
have
ye
brought
him
to
me
have
i
need
of
mad
men
that
ye
have
brought
this
fellow
to
play
the
mad
man
in
my
presence
shall
this
fellow
come
into
my
house
david
therefore
departed
thence
and
escaped
to
the
cave
adullam
and
when
his
brethren
and
all
his
father's
house
heard
it
they
went
down
thither
to
him
and
every
one
that
was
in
distress
and
every
one
that
was
in
debt
and
every
one
that
was
discontented
gathered
themselves
unto
him
and
he
became
a
captain
over
them
and
there
were
with
him
about
four
hundred
men
and
david
went
thence
to
mizpeh
of
moab
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
moab
let
my
father
and
my
mother
i
pray
thee
come
forth
and
be
with
you
till
i
know
what
god
will
do
for
me
and
he
brought
them
before
the
king
of
moab
and
they
dwelt
with
him
all
the
while
that
david
was
in
the
hold
and
the
prophet
gad
said
unto
david
abide
not
in
the
hold
depart
and
get
thee
into
the
land
of
judah
then
david
departed
and
came
into
the
forest
of
hareth
when
saul
heard
that
david
was
discovered
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
now
saul
abode
in
gibeah
under
a
tree
in
ramah
having
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
about
him
then
saul
said
unto
his
servants
that
stood
about
him
hear
now
ye
benjamites
will
the
son
of
jesse
give
every
one
of
you
fields
and
vineyards
and
make
you
all
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
that
all
of
you
have
conspired
against
me
and
there
is
none
that
sheweth
me
that
my
son
hath
made
a
league
with
the
son
of
jesse
and
there
is
none
of
you
that
is
sorry
for
me
or
sheweth
unto
me
that
my
son
hath
stirred
up
my
servant
against
me
to
lie
in
wait
as
at
this
day
then
answered
doeg
the
edomite
which
was
set
over
the
servants
of
saul
and
said
i
saw
the
son
of
jesse
coming
to
nob
to
ahimelech
the
son
of
ahitub
and
he
enquired
of
the
lord
for
him
and
gave
him
victuals
and
gave
him
the
sword
of
goliath
the
philistine
then
the
king
sent
to
call
ahimelech
the
priest
the
son
of
ahitub
and
all
his
father's
house
the
priests
that
were
in
nob
and
they
came
all
of
them
to
the
king
and
saul
said
hear
now
thou
son
of
ahitub
and
he
answered
here
i
am
my
lord
and
saul
said
unto
him
why
have
ye
conspired
against
me
thou
and
the
son
of
jesse
in
that
thou
hast
given
him
bread
and
a
sword
and
hast
enquired
of
god
for
him
that
he
should
rise
against
me
to
lie
in
wait
as
at
this
day
then
ahimelech
answered
the
king
and
said
and
who
is
so
faithful
among
all
thy
servants
as
david
which
is
the
king's
son
in
law
and
goeth
at
thy
bidding
and
is
honourable
in
thine
house
did
i
then
begin
to
enquire
of
god
for
him
be
it
far
from
me
let
not
the
king
impute
any
thing
unto
his
servant
nor
to
all
the
house
of
my
father
for
thy
servant
knew
nothing
of
all
this
less
or
more
and
the
king
said
thou
shalt
surely
die
ahimelech
thou
and
all
thy
father's
house
and
the
king
said
unto
the
footmen
that
stood
about
him
turn
and
slay
the
priests
of
the
lord
because
their
hand
also
is
with
david
and
because
they
knew
when
he
fled
and
did
not
shew
it
to
me
but
the
servants
of
the
king
would
not
put
forth
their
hand
to
fall
upon
the
priests
of
the
lord
and
the
king
said
to
doeg
turn
thou
and
fall
upon
the
priests
and
doeg
the
edomite
turned
and
he
fell
upon
the
priests
and
slew
on
that
day
fourscore
and
five
persons
that
did
wear
a
linen
ephod
and
nob
the
city
of
the
priests
smote
he
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
both
men
and
women
children
and
sucklings
and
oxen
and
asses
and
sheep
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
one
of
the
sons
of
ahimelech
the
son
of
ahitub
named
abiathar
escaped
and
fled
after
david
and
abiathar
shewed
david
that
saul
had
slain
the
lord's
priests
and
david
said
unto
abiathar
i
knew
it
that
day
when
doeg
the
edomite
was
there
that
he
would
surely
tell
saul
i
have
occasioned
the
death
of
all
the
persons
of
thy
father's
house
abide
thou
with
me
fear
not
for
he
that
seeketh
my
life
seeketh
thy
life
but
with
me
thou
shalt
be
in
safeguard
then
they
told
david
saying
behold
the
philistines
fight
against
keilah
and
they
rob
the
threshingfloors
therefore
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
and
smite
these
philistines
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
go
and
smite
the
philistines
and
save
keilah
and
david's
men
said
unto
him
behold
we
be
afraid
here
in
judah
how
much
more
then
if
we
come
to
keilah
against
the
armies
of
the
philistines
then
david
enquired
of
the
lord
yet
again
and
the
lord
answered
him
and
said
arise
go
down
to
keilah
for
i
will
deliver
the
philistines
into
thine
hand
so
david
and
his
men
went
to
keilah
and
fought
with
the
philistines
and
brought
away
their
cattle
and
smote
them
with
a
great
slaughter
so
david
saved
the
inhabitants
of
keilah
and
it
came
to
pass
when
abiathar
the
son
of
ahimelech
fled
to
david
to
keilah
that
he
came
down
with
an
ephod
in
his
hand
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
come
to
keilah
and
saul
said
god
hath
delivered
him
into
mine
hand
for
he
is
shut
in
by
entering
into
a
town
that
hath
gates
and
bars
and
saul
called
all
the
people
together
to
war
to
go
down
to
keilah
to
besiege
david
and
his
men
and
david
knew
that
saul
secretly
practised
mischief
against
him
and
he
said
to
abiathar
the
priest
bring
hither
the
ephod
then
said
david
o
lord
god
of
israel
thy
servant
hath
certainly
heard
that
saul
seeketh
to
come
to
keilah
to
destroy
the
city
for
my
sake
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
up
into
his
hand
will
saul
come
down
as
thy
servant
hath
heard
o
lord
god
of
israel
i
beseech
thee
tell
thy
servant
and
the
lord
said
he
will
come
down
then
said
david
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
and
my
men
into
the
hand
of
saul
and
the
lord
said
they
will
deliver
thee
up
then
david
and
his
men
which
were
about
six
hundred
arose
and
departed
out
of
keilah
and
went
whithersoever
they
could
go
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
escaped
from
keilah
and
he
forbare
to
go
forth
and
david
abode
in
the
wilderness
in
strong
holds
and
remained
in
a
mountain
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
and
saul
sought
him
every
day
but
god
delivered
him
not
into
his
hand
and
david
saw
that
saul
was
come
out
to
seek
his
life
and
david
was
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
in
a
wood
and
jonathan
saul's
son
arose
and
went
to
david
into
the
wood
and
strengthened
his
hand
in
god
and
he
said
unto
him
fear
not
for
the
hand
of
saul
my
father
shall
not
find
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
king
over
israel
and
i
shall
be
next
unto
thee
and
that
also
saul
my
father
knoweth
and
they
two
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
and
david
abode
in
the
wood
and
jonathan
went
to
his
house
then
came
up
the
ziphites
to
saul
to
gibeah
saying
doth
not
david
hide
himself
with
us
in
strong
holds
in
the
wood
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
on
the
south
of
jeshimon
now
therefore
o
king
come
down
according
to
all
the
desire
of
thy
soul
to
come
down
and
our
part
shall
be
to
deliver
him
into
the
king's
hand
and
saul
said
blessed
be
ye
of
the
lord
for
ye
have
compassion
on
me
go
i
pray
you
prepare
yet
and
know
and
see
his
place
where
his
haunt
is
and
who
hath
seen
him
there
for
it
is
told
me
that
he
dealeth
very
subtilly
see
therefore
and
take
knowledge
of
all
the
lurking
places
where
he
hideth
himself
and
come
ye
again
to
me
with
the
certainty
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
he
be
in
the
land
that
i
will
search
him
out
throughout
all
the
thousands
of
judah
and
they
arose
and
went
to
ziph
before
saul
but
david
and
his
men
were
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
in
the
plain
on
the
south
of
jeshimon
saul
also
and
his
men
went
to
seek
him
and
they
told
david
wherefore
he
came
down
into
a
rock
and
abode
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
and
when
saul
heard
that
he
pursued
after
david
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
and
saul
went
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
and
david
and
his
men
on
that
side
of
the
mountain
and
david
made
haste
to
get
away
for
fear
of
saul
for
saul
and
his
men
compassed
david
and
his
men
round
about
to
take
them
but
there
came
a
messenger
unto
saul
saying
haste
thee
and
come
for
the
philistines
have
invaded
the
land
wherefore
saul
returned
from
pursuing
after
david
and
went
against
the
philistines
therefore
they
called
that
place
selahammahlekoth
and
david
went
up
from
thence
and
dwelt
in
strong
holds
at
engedi
and
it
came
to
pass
when
saul
was
returned
from
following
the
philistines
that
it
was
told
him
saying
behold
david
is
in
the
wilderness
of
engedi
then
saul
took
three
thousand
chosen
men
out
of
all
israel
and
went
to
seek
david
and
his
men
upon
the
rocks
of
the
wild
goats
and
he
came
to
the
sheepcotes
by
the
way
where
was
a
cave
and
saul
went
in
to
cover
his
feet
and
david
and
his
men
remained
in
the
sides
of
the
cave
and
the
men
of
david
said
unto
him
behold
the
day
of
which
the
lord
said
unto
thee
behold
i
will
deliver
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
that
thou
mayest
do
to
him
as
it
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
then
david
arose
and
cut
off
the
skirt
of
saul's
robe
privily
and
it
came
to
pass
afterward
that
david's
heart
smote
him
because
he
had
cut
off
saul's
skirt
and
he
said
unto
his
men
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
do
this
thing
unto
my
master
the
lord's
anointed
to
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
him
seeing
he
is
the
anointed
of
the
lord
so
david
stayed
his
servants
with
these
words
and
suffered
them
not
to
rise
against
saul
but
saul
rose
up
out
of
the
cave
and
went
on
his
way
david
also
arose
afterward
and
went
out
of
the
cave
and
cried
after
saul
saying
my
lord
the
king
and
when
saul
looked
behind
him
david
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
earth
and
bowed
himself
and
david
said
to
saul
wherefore
hearest
thou
men's
words
saying
behold
david
seeketh
thy
hurt
behold
this
day
thine
eyes
have
seen
how
that
the
lord
had
delivered
thee
to
day
into
mine
hand
in
the
cave
and
some
bade
me
kill
thee
but
mine
eye
spared
thee
and
i
said
i
will
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
my
lord
for
he
is
the
lord's
anointed
moreover
my
father
see
yea
see
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
in
my
hand
for
in
that
i
cut
off
the
skirt
of
thy
robe
and
killed
thee
not
know
thou
and
see
that
there
is
neither
evil
nor
transgression
in
mine
hand
and
i
have
not
sinned
against
thee
yet
thou
huntest
my
soul
to
take
it
the
lord
judge
between
me
and
thee
and
the
lord
avenge
me
of
thee
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee
as
saith
the
proverb
of
the
ancients
wickedness
proceedeth
from
the
wicked
but
mine
hand
shall
not
be
upon
thee
after
whom
is
the
king
of
israel
come
out
after
whom
dost
thou
pursue
after
a
dead
dog
after
a
flea
the
lord
therefore
be
judge
and
judge
between
me
and
thee
and
see
and
plead
my
cause
and
deliver
me
out
of
thine
hand
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
unto
saul
that
saul
said
is
this
thy
voice
my
son
david
and
saul
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
and
he
said
to
david
thou
art
more
righteous
than
i
for
thou
hast
rewarded
me
good
whereas
i
have
rewarded
thee
evil
and
thou
hast
shewed
this
day
how
that
thou
hast
dealt
well
with
me
forasmuch
as
when
the
lord
had
delivered
me
into
thine
hand
thou
killedst
me
not
for
if
a
man
find
his
enemy
will
he
let
him
go
well
away
wherefore
the
lord
reward
thee
good
for
that
thou
hast
done
unto
me
this
day
and
now
behold
i
know
well
that
thou
shalt
surely
be
king
and
that
the
kingdom
of
israel
shall
be
established
in
thine
hand
swear
now
therefore
unto
me
by
the
lord
that
thou
wilt
not
cut
off
my
seed
after
me
and
that
thou
wilt
not
destroy
my
name
out
of
my
father's
house
and
david
sware
unto
saul
and
saul
went
home
but
david
and
his
men
gat
them
up
unto
the
hold
and
samuel
died
and
all
the
israelites
were
gathered
together
and
lamented
him
and
buried
him
in
his
house
at
ramah
and
david
arose
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
paran
and
there
was
a
man
in
maon
whose
possessions
were
in
carmel
and
the
man
was
very
great
and
he
had
three
thousand
sheep
and
a
thousand
goats
and
he
was
shearing
his
sheep
in
carmel
now
the
name
of
the
man
was
nabal
and
the
name
of
his
wife
abigail
and
she
was
a
woman
of
good
understanding
and
of
a
beautiful
countenance
but
the
man
was
churlish
and
evil
in
his
doings
and
he
was
of
the
house
of
caleb
and
david
heard
in
the
wilderness
that
nabal
did
shear
his
sheep
and
david
sent
out
ten
young
men
and
david
said
unto
the
young
men
get
you
up
to
carmel
and
go
to
nabal
and
greet
him
in
my
name
and
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him
that
liveth
in
prosperity
peace
be
both
to
thee
and
peace
be
to
thine
house
and
peace
be
unto
all
that
thou
hast
and
now
i
have
heard
that
thou
hast
shearers
now
thy
shepherds
which
were
with
us
we
hurt
them
not
neither
was
there
ought
missing
unto
them
all
the
while
they
were
in
carmel
ask
thy
young
men
and
they
will
shew
thee
wherefore
let
the
young
men
find
favour
in
thine
eyes
for
we
come
in
a
good
day
give
i
pray
thee
whatsoever
cometh
to
thine
hand
unto
thy
servants
and
to
thy
son
david
and
when
david's
young
men
came
they
spake
to
nabal
according
to
all
those
words
in
the
name
of
david
and
ceased
and
nabal
answered
david's
servants
and
said
who
is
david
and
who
is
the
son
of
jesse
there
be
many
servants
now
a
days
that
break
away
every
man
from
his
master
shall
i
then
take
my
bread
and
my
water
and
my
flesh
that
i
have
killed
for
my
shearers
and
give
it
unto
men
whom
i
know
not
whence
they
be
so
david's
young
men
turned
their
way
and
went
again
and
came
and
told
him
all
those
sayings
and
david
said
unto
his
men
gird
ye
on
every
man
his
sword
and
they
girded
on
every
man
his
sword
and
david
also
girded
on
his
sword
and
there
went
up
after
david
about
four
hundred
men
and
two
hundred
abode
by
the
stuff
but
one
of
the
young
men
told
abigail
nabal's
wife
saying
behold
david
sent
messengers
out
of
the
wilderness
to
salute
our
master
and
he
railed
on
them
but
the
men
were
very
good
unto
us
and
we
were
not
hurt
neither
missed
we
any
thing
as
long
as
we
were
conversant
with
them
when
we
were
in
the
fields
they
were
a
wall
unto
us
both
by
night
and
day
all
the
while
we
were
with
them
keeping
the
sheep
now
therefore
know
and
consider
what
thou
wilt
do
for
evil
is
determined
against
our
master
and
against
all
his
household
for
he
is
such
a
son
of
belial
that
a
man
cannot
speak
to
him
then
abigail
made
haste
and
took
two
hundred
loaves
and
two
bottles
of
wine
and
five
sheep
ready
dressed
and
five
measures
of
parched
corn
and
an
hundred
clusters
of
raisins
and
two
hundred
cakes
of
figs
and
laid
them
on
asses
and
she
said
unto
her
servants
go
on
before
me
behold
i
come
after
you
but
she
told
not
her
husband
nabal
and
it
was
so
as
she
rode
on
the
ass
that
she
came
down
by
the
covert
on
the
hill
and
behold
david
and
his
men
came
down
against
her
and
she
met
them
now
david
had
said
surely
in
vain
have
i
kept
all
that
this
fellow
hath
in
the
wilderness
so
that
nothing
was
missed
of
all
that
pertained
unto
him
and
he
hath
requited
me
evil
for
good
so
and
more
also
do
god
unto
the
enemies
of
david
if
i
leave
of
all
that
pertain
to
him
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
when
abigail
saw
david
she
hasted
and
lighted
off
the
ass
and
fell
before
david
on
her
face
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
and
fell
at
his
feet
and
said
upon
me
my
lord
upon
me
let
this
iniquity
be
and
let
thine
handmaid
i
pray
thee
speak
in
thine
audience
and
hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid
let
not
my
lord
i
pray
thee
regard
this
man
of
belial
even
nabal
for
as
his
name
is
so
is
he
nabal
is
his
name
and
folly
is
with
him
but
i
thine
handmaid
saw
not
the
young
men
of
my
lord
whom
thou
didst
send
now
therefore
my
lord
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
seeing
the
lord
hath
withholden
thee
from
coming
to
shed
blood
and
from
avenging
thyself
with
thine
own
hand
now
let
thine
enemies
and
they
that
seek
evil
to
my
lord
be
as
nabal
and
now
this
blessing
which
thine
handmaid
hath
brought
unto
my
lord
let
it
even
be
given
unto
the
young
men
that
follow
my
lord
i
pray
thee
forgive
the
trespass
of
thine
handmaid
for
the
lord
will
certainly
make
my
lord
a
sure
house
because
my
lord
fighteth
the
battles
of
the
lord
and
evil
hath
not
been
found
in
thee
all
thy
days
yet
a
man
is
risen
to
pursue
thee
and
to
seek
thy
soul
but
the
soul
of
my
lord
shall
be
bound
in
the
bundle
of
life
with
the
lord
thy
god
and
the
souls
of
thine
enemies
them
shall
he
sling
out
as
out
of
the
middle
of
a
sling
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
shall
have
done
to
my
lord
according
to
all
the
good
that
he
hath
spoken
concerning
thee
and
shall
have
appointed
thee
ruler
over
israel
that
this
shall
be
no
grief
unto
thee
nor
offence
of
heart
unto
my
lord
either
that
thou
hast
shed
blood
causeless
or
that
my
lord
hath
avenged
himself
but
when
the
lord
shall
have
dealt
well
with
my
lord
then
remember
thine
handmaid
and
david
said
to
abigail
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
sent
thee
this
day
to
meet
me
and
blessed
be
thy
advice
and
blessed
be
thou
which
hast
kept
me
this
day
from
coming
to
shed
blood
and
from
avenging
myself
with
mine
own
hand
for
in
very
deed
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
liveth
which
hath
kept
me
back
from
hurting
thee
except
thou
hadst
hasted
and
come
to
meet
me
surely
there
had
not
been
left
unto
nabal
by
the
morning
light
any
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
so
david
received
of
her
hand
that
which
she
had
brought
him
and
said
unto
her
go
up
in
peace
to
thine
house
see
i
have
hearkened
to
thy
voice
and
have
accepted
thy
person
and
abigail
came
to
nabal
and
behold
he
held
a
feast
in
his
house
like
the
feast
of
a
king
and
nabal's
heart
was
merry
within
him
for
he
was
very
drunken
wherefore
she
told
him
nothing
less
or
more
until
the
morning
light
but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
when
the
wine
was
gone
out
of
nabal
and
his
wife
had
told
him
these
things
that
his
heart
died
within
him
and
he
became
as
a
stone
and
it
came
to
pass
about
ten
days
after
that
the
lord
smote
nabal
that
he
died
and
when
david
heard
that
nabal
was
dead
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
that
hath
pleaded
the
cause
of
my
reproach
from
the
hand
of
nabal
and
hath
kept
his
servant
from
evil
for
the
lord
hath
returned
the
wickedness
of
nabal
upon
his
own
head
and
david
sent
and
communed
with
abigail
to
take
her
to
him
to
wife
and
when
the
servants
of
david
were
come
to
abigail
to
carmel
they
spake
unto
her
saying
david
sent
us
unto
thee
to
take
thee
to
him
to
wife
and
she
arose
and
bowed
herself
on
her
face
to
the
earth
and
said
behold
let
thine
handmaid
be
a
servant
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
servants
of
my
lord
and
abigail
hasted
and
arose
and
rode
upon
an
ass
with
five
damsels
of
hers
that
went
after
her
and
she
went
after
the
messengers
of
david
and
became
his
wife
david
also
took
ahinoam
of
jezreel
and
they
were
also
both
of
them
his
wives
but
saul
had
given
michal
his
daughter
david's
wife
to
phalti
the
son
of
laish
which
was
of
gallim
and
the
ziphites
came
unto
saul
to
gibeah
saying
doth
not
david
hide
himself
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
before
jeshimon
then
saul
arose
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
ziph
having
three
thousand
chosen
men
of
israel
with
him
to
seek
david
in
the
wilderness
of
ziph
and
saul
pitched
in
the
hill
of
hachilah
which
is
before
jeshimon
by
the
way
but
david
abode
in
the
wilderness
and
he
saw
that
saul
came
after
him
into
the
wilderness
david
therefore
sent
out
spies
and
understood
that
saul
was
come
in
very
deed
and
david
arose
and
came
to
the
place
where
saul
had
pitched
and
david
beheld
the
place
where
saul
lay
and
abner
the
son
of
ner
the
captain
of
his
host
and
saul
lay
in
the
trench
and
the
people
pitched
round
about
him
then
answered
david
and
said
to
ahimelech
the
hittite
and
to
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
brother
to
joab
saying
who
will
go
down
with
me
to
saul
to
the
camp
and
abishai
said
i
will
go
down
with
thee
so
david
and
abishai
came
to
the
people
by
night
and
behold
saul
lay
sleeping
within
the
trench
and
his
spear
stuck
in
the
ground
at
his
bolster
but
abner
and
the
people
lay
round
about
him
then
said
abishai
to
david
god
hath
delivered
thine
enemy
into
thine
hand
this
day
now
therefore
let
me
smite
him
i
pray
thee
with
the
spear
even
to
the
earth
at
once
and
i
will
not
smite
him
the
second
time
and
david
said
to
abishai
destroy
him
not
for
who
can
stretch
forth
his
hand
against
the
lord's
anointed
and
be
guiltless
david
said
furthermore
as
the
lord
liveth
the
lord
shall
smite
him
or
his
day
shall
come
to
die
or
he
shall
descend
into
battle
and
perish
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
lord's
anointed
but
i
pray
thee
take
thou
now
the
spear
that
is
at
his
bolster
and
the
cruse
of
water
and
let
us
go
so
david
took
the
spear
and
the
cruse
of
water
from
saul's
bolster
and
they
gat
them
away
and
no
man
saw
it
nor
knew
it
neither
awaked
for
they
were
all
asleep
because
a
deep
sleep
from
the
lord
was
fallen
upon
them
then
david
went
over
to
the
other
side
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
afar
off
a
great
space
being
between
them
and
david
cried
to
the
people
and
to
abner
the
son
of
ner
saying
answerest
thou
not
abner
then
abner
answered
and
said
who
art
thou
that
criest
to
the
king
and
david
said
to
abner
art
not
thou
a
valiant
man
and
who
is
like
to
thee
in
israel
wherefore
then
hast
thou
not
kept
thy
lord
the
king
for
there
came
one
of
the
people
in
to
destroy
the
king
thy
lord
this
thing
is
not
good
that
thou
hast
done
as
the
lord
liveth
ye
are
worthy
to
die
because
ye
have
not
kept
your
master
the
lord's
anointed
and
now
see
where
the
king's
spear
is
and
the
cruse
of
water
that
was
at
his
bolster
and
saul
knew
david's
voice
and
said
is
this
thy
voice
my
son
david
and
david
said
it
is
my
voice
my
lord
o
king
and
he
said
wherefore
doth
my
lord
thus
pursue
after
his
servant
for
what
have
i
done
or
what
evil
is
in
mine
hand
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
let
my
lord
the
king
hear
the
words
of
his
servant
if
the
lord
have
stirred
thee
up
against
me
let
him
accept
an
offering
but
if
they
be
the
children
of
men
cursed
be
they
before
the
lord
for
they
have
driven
me
out
this
day
from
abiding
in
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
saying
go
serve
other
gods
now
therefore
let
not
my
blood
fall
to
the
earth
before
the
face
of
the
lord
for
the
king
of
israel
is
come
out
to
seek
a
flea
as
when
one
doth
hunt
a
partridge
in
the
mountains
then
said
saul
i
have
sinned
return
my
son
david
for
i
will
no
more
do
thee
harm
because
my
soul
was
precious
in
thine
eyes
this
day
behold
i
have
played
the
fool
and
have
erred
exceedingly
and
david
answered
and
said
behold
the
king's
spear
and
let
one
of
the
young
men
come
over
and
fetch
it
the
lord
render
to
every
man
his
righteousness
and
his
faithfulness
for
the
lord
delivered
thee
into
my
hand
to
day
but
i
would
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
against
the
lord's
anointed
and
behold
as
thy
life
was
much
set
by
this
day
in
mine
eyes
so
let
my
life
be
much
set
by
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
let
him
deliver
me
out
of
all
tribulation
then
saul
said
to
david
blessed
be
thou
my
son
david
thou
shalt
both
do
great
things
and
also
shalt
still
prevail
so
david
went
on
his
way
and
saul
returned
to
his
place
and
david
said
in
his
heart
i
shall
now
perish
one
day
by
the
hand
of
saul
there
is
nothing
better
for
me
than
that
i
should
speedily
escape
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
saul
shall
despair
of
me
to
seek
me
any
more
in
any
coast
of
israel
so
shall
i
escape
out
of
his
hand
and
david
arose
and
he
passed
over
with
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
unto
achish
the
son
of
maoch
king
of
gath
and
david
dwelt
with
achish
at
gath
he
and
his
men
every
man
with
his
household
even
david
with
his
two
wives
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
the
carmelitess
nabal's
wife
and
it
was
told
saul
that
david
was
fled
to
gath
and
he
sought
no
more
again
for
him
and
david
said
unto
achish
if
i
have
now
found
grace
in
thine
eyes
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
some
town
in
the
country
that
i
may
dwell
there
for
why
should
thy
servant
dwell
in
the
royal
city
with
thee
then
achish
gave
him
ziklag
that
day
wherefore
ziklag
pertaineth
unto
the
kings
of
judah
unto
this
day
and
the
time
that
david
dwelt
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
was
a
full
year
and
four
months
and
david
and
his
men
went
up
and
invaded
the
geshurites
and
the
gezrites
and
the
amalekites
for
those
nations
were
of
old
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
as
thou
goest
to
shur
even
unto
the
land
of
egypt
and
david
smote
the
land
and
left
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
and
took
away
the
sheep
and
the
oxen
and
the
asses
and
the
camels
and
the
apparel
and
returned
and
came
to
achish
and
achish
said
whither
have
ye
made
a
road
to
day
and
david
said
against
the
south
of
judah
and
against
the
south
of
the
jerahmeelites
and
against
the
south
of
the
kenites
and
david
saved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
to
bring
tidings
to
gath
saying
lest
they
should
tell
on
us
saying
so
did
david
and
so
will
be
his
manner
all
the
while
he
dwelleth
in
the
country
of
the
philistines
and
achish
believed
david
saying
he
hath
made
his
people
israel
utterly
to
abhor
him
therefore
he
shall
be
my
servant
for
ever
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
the
philistines
gathered
their
armies
together
for
warfare
to
fight
with
israel
and
achish
said
unto
david
know
thou
assuredly
that
thou
shalt
go
out
with
me
to
battle
thou
and
thy
men
and
david
said
to
achish
surely
thou
shalt
know
what
thy
servant
can
do
and
achish
said
to
david
therefore
will
i
make
thee
keeper
of
mine
head
for
ever
now
samuel
was
dead
and
all
israel
had
lamented
him
and
buried
him
in
ramah
even
in
his
own
city
and
saul
had
put
away
those
that
had
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
of
the
land
and
the
philistines
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
and
pitched
in
shunem
and
saul
gathered
all
israel
together
and
they
pitched
in
gilboa
and
when
saul
saw
the
host
of
the
philistines
he
was
afraid
and
his
heart
greatly
trembled
and
when
saul
enquired
of
the
lord
the
lord
answered
him
not
neither
by
dreams
nor
by
urim
nor
by
prophets
then
said
saul
unto
his
servants
seek
me
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
that
i
may
go
to
her
and
enquire
of
her
and
his
servants
said
to
him
behold
there
is
a
woman
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
at
endor
and
saul
disguised
himself
and
put
on
other
raiment
and
he
went
and
two
men
with
him
and
they
came
to
the
woman
by
night
and
he
said
i
pray
thee
divine
unto
me
by
the
familiar
spirit
and
bring
me
him
up
whom
i
shall
name
unto
thee
and
the
woman
said
unto
him
behold
thou
knowest
what
saul
hath
done
how
he
hath
cut
off
those
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
out
of
the
land
wherefore
then
layest
thou
a
snare
for
my
life
to
cause
me
to
die
and
saul
sware
to
her
by
the
lord
saying
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
no
punishment
happen
to
thee
for
this
thing
then
said
the
woman
whom
shall
i
bring
up
unto
thee
and
he
said
bring
me
up
samuel
and
when
the
woman
saw
samuel
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
the
woman
spake
to
saul
saying
why
hast
thou
deceived
me
for
thou
art
saul
and
the
king
said
unto
her
be
not
afraid
for
what
sawest
thou
and
the
woman
said
unto
saul
i
saw
gods
ascending
out
of
the
earth
and
he
said
unto
her
what
form
is
he
of
and
she
said
an
old
man
cometh
up
and
he
is
covered
with
a
mantle
and
saul
perceived
that
it
was
samuel
and
he
stooped
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
himself
and
samuel
said
to
saul
why
hast
thou
disquieted
me
to
bring
me
up
and
saul
answered
i
am
sore
distressed
for
the
philistines
make
war
against
me
and
god
is
departed
from
me
and
answereth
me
no
more
neither
by
prophets
nor
by
dreams
therefore
i
have
called
thee
that
thou
mayest
make
known
unto
me
what
i
shall
do
then
said
samuel
wherefore
then
dost
thou
ask
of
me
seeing
the
lord
is
departed
from
thee
and
is
become
thine
enemy
and
the
lord
hath
done
to
him
as
he
spake
by
me
for
the
lord
hath
rent
the
kingdom
out
of
thine
hand
and
given
it
to
thy
neighbour
even
to
david
because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
nor
executedst
his
fierce
wrath
upon
amalek
therefore
hath
the
lord
done
this
thing
unto
thee
this
day
moreover
the
lord
will
also
deliver
israel
with
thee
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
to
morrow
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
be
with
me
the
lord
also
shall
deliver
the
host
of
israel
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
then
saul
fell
straightway
all
along
on
the
earth
and
was
sore
afraid
because
of
the
words
of
samuel
and
there
was
no
strength
in
him
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
all
the
day
nor
all
the
night
and
the
woman
came
unto
saul
and
saw
that
he
was
sore
troubled
and
said
unto
him
behold
thine
handmaid
hath
obeyed
thy
voice
and
i
have
put
my
life
in
my
hand
and
have
hearkened
unto
thy
words
which
thou
spakest
unto
me
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
hearken
thou
also
unto
the
voice
of
thine
handmaid
and
let
me
set
a
morsel
of
bread
before
thee
and
eat
that
thou
mayest
have
strength
when
thou
goest
on
thy
way
but
he
refused
and
said
i
will
not
eat
but
his
servants
together
with
the
woman
compelled
him
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
voice
so
he
arose
from
the
earth
and
sat
upon
the
bed
and
the
woman
had
a
fat
calf
in
the
house
and
she
hasted
and
killed
it
and
took
flour
and
kneaded
it
and
did
bake
unleavened
bread
thereof
and
she
brought
it
before
saul
and
before
his
servants
and
they
did
eat
then
they
rose
up
and
went
away
that
night
now
the
philistines
gathered
together
all
their
armies
to
aphek
and
the
israelites
pitched
by
a
fountain
which
is
in
jezreel
and
the
lords
of
the
philistines
passed
on
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
but
david
and
his
men
passed
on
in
the
rereward
with
achish
then
said
the
princes
of
the
philistines
what
do
these
hebrews
here
and
achish
said
unto
the
princes
of
the
philistines
is
not
this
david
the
servant
of
saul
the
king
of
israel
which
hath
been
with
me
these
days
or
these
years
and
i
have
found
no
fault
in
him
since
he
fell
unto
me
unto
this
day
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
were
wroth
with
him
and
the
princes
of
the
philistines
said
unto
him
make
this
fellow
return
that
he
may
go
again
to
his
place
which
thou
hast
appointed
him
and
let
him
not
go
down
with
us
to
battle
lest
in
the
battle
he
be
an
adversary
to
us
for
wherewith
should
he
reconcile
himself
unto
his
master
should
it
not
be
with
the
heads
of
these
men
is
not
this
david
of
whom
they
sang
one
to
another
in
dances
saying
saul
slew
his
thousands
and
david
his
ten
thousands
then
achish
called
david
and
said
unto
him
surely
as
the
lord
liveth
thou
hast
been
upright
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
with
me
in
the
host
is
good
in
my
sight
for
i
have
not
found
evil
in
thee
since
the
day
of
thy
coming
unto
me
unto
this
day
nevertheless
the
lords
favour
thee
not
wherefore
now
return
and
go
in
peace
that
thou
displease
not
the
lords
of
the
philistines
and
david
said
unto
achish
but
what
have
i
done
and
what
hast
thou
found
in
thy
servant
so
long
as
i
have
been
with
thee
unto
this
day
that
i
may
not
go
fight
against
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
and
achish
answered
and
said
to
david
i
know
that
thou
art
good
in
my
sight
as
an
angel
of
god
notwithstanding
the
princes
of
the
philistines
have
said
he
shall
not
go
up
with
us
to
the
battle
wherefore
now
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
with
thy
master's
servants
that
are
come
with
thee
and
as
soon
as
ye
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
have
light
depart
so
david
and
his
men
rose
up
early
to
depart
in
the
morning
to
return
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
the
philistines
went
up
to
jezreel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
and
his
men
were
come
to
ziklag
on
the
third
day
that
the
amalekites
had
invaded
the
south
and
ziklag
and
smitten
ziklag
and
burned
it
with
fire
and
had
taken
the
women
captives
that
were
therein
they
slew
not
any
either
great
or
small
but
carried
them
away
and
went
on
their
way
so
david
and
his
men
came
to
the
city
and
behold
it
was
burned
with
fire
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
were
taken
captives
then
david
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
until
they
had
no
more
power
to
weep
and
david's
two
wives
were
taken
captives
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
the
wife
of
nabal
the
carmelite
and
david
was
greatly
distressed
for
the
people
spake
of
stoning
him
because
the
soul
of
all
the
people
was
grieved
every
man
for
his
sons
and
for
his
daughters
but
david
encouraged
himself
in
the
lord
his
god
and
david
said
to
abiathar
the
priest
ahimelech's
son
i
pray
thee
bring
me
hither
the
ephod
and
abiathar
brought
thither
the
ephod
to
david
and
david
enquired
at
the
lord
saying
shall
i
pursue
after
this
troop
shall
i
overtake
them
and
he
answered
him
pursue
for
thou
shalt
surely
overtake
them
and
without
fail
recover
all
so
david
went
he
and
the
six
hundred
men
that
were
with
him
and
came
to
the
brook
besor
where
those
that
were
left
behind
stayed
but
david
pursued
he
and
four
hundred
men
for
two
hundred
abode
behind
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
go
over
the
brook
besor
and
they
found
an
egyptian
in
the
field
and
brought
him
to
david
and
gave
him
bread
and
he
did
eat
and
they
made
him
drink
water
and
they
gave
him
a
piece
of
a
cake
of
figs
and
two
clusters
of
raisins
and
when
he
had
eaten
his
spirit
came
again
to
him
for
he
had
eaten
no
bread
nor
drunk
any
water
three
days
and
three
nights
and
david
said
unto
him
to
whom
belongest
thou
and
whence
art
thou
and
he
said
i
am
a
young
man
of
egypt
servant
to
an
amalekite
and
my
master
left
me
because
three
days
agone
i
fell
sick
we
made
an
invasion
upon
the
south
of
the
cherethites
and
upon
the
coast
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
upon
the
south
of
caleb
and
we
burned
ziklag
with
fire
and
david
said
to
him
canst
thou
bring
me
down
to
this
company
and
he
said
swear
unto
me
by
god
that
thou
wilt
neither
kill
me
nor
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
my
master
and
i
will
bring
thee
down
to
this
company
and
when
he
had
brought
him
down
behold
they
were
spread
abroad
upon
all
the
earth
eating
and
drinking
and
dancing
because
of
all
the
great
spoil
that
they
had
taken
out
of
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
out
of
the
land
of
judah
and
david
smote
them
from
the
twilight
even
unto
the
evening
of
the
next
day
and
there
escaped
not
a
man
of
them
save
four
hundred
young
men
which
rode
upon
camels
and
fled
and
david
recovered
all
that
the
amalekites
had
carried
away
and
david
rescued
his
two
wives
and
there
was
nothing
lacking
to
them
neither
small
nor
great
neither
sons
nor
daughters
neither
spoil
nor
any
thing
that
they
had
taken
to
them
david
recovered
all
and
david
took
all
the
flocks
and
the
herds
which
they
drave
before
those
other
cattle
and
said
this
is
david's
spoil
and
david
came
to
the
two
hundred
men
which
were
so
faint
that
they
could
not
follow
david
whom
they
had
made
also
to
abide
at
the
brook
besor
and
they
went
forth
to
meet
david
and
to
meet
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
when
david
came
near
to
the
people
he
saluted
them
then
answered
all
the
wicked
men
and
men
of
belial
of
those
that
went
with
david
and
said
because
they
went
not
with
us
we
will
not
give
them
ought
of
the
spoil
that
we
have
recovered
save
to
every
man
his
wife
and
his
children
that
they
may
lead
them
away
and
depart
then
said
david
ye
shall
not
do
so
my
brethren
with
that
which
the
lord
hath
given
us
who
hath
preserved
us
and
delivered
the
company
that
came
against
us
into
our
hand
for
who
will
hearken
unto
you
in
this
matter
but
as
his
part
is
that
goeth
down
to
the
battle
so
shall
his
part
be
that
tarrieth
by
the
stuff
they
shall
part
alike
and
it
was
so
from
that
day
forward
that
he
made
it
a
statute
and
an
ordinance
for
israel
unto
this
day
and
when
david
came
to
ziklag
he
sent
of
the
spoil
unto
the
elders
of
judah
even
to
his
friends
saying
behold
a
present
for
you
of
the
spoil
of
the
enemies
of
the
lord
to
them
which
were
in
bethel
and
to
them
which
were
in
south
ramoth
and
to
them
which
were
in
jattir
and
to
them
which
were
in
aroer
and
to
them
which
were
in
siphmoth
and
to
them
which
were
in
eshtemoa
and
to
them
which
were
in
rachal
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
jerahmeelites
and
to
them
which
were
in
the
cities
of
the
kenites
and
to
them
which
were
in
hormah
and
to
them
which
were
in
chorashan
and
to
them
which
were
in
athach
and
to
them
which
were
in
hebron
and
to
all
the
places
where
david
himself
and
his
men
were
wont
to
haunt
now
the
philistines
fought
against
israel
and
the
men
of
israel
fled
from
before
the
philistines
and
fell
down
slain
in
mount
gilboa
and
the
philistines
followed
hard
upon
saul
and
upon
his
sons
and
the
philistines
slew
jonathan
and
abinadab
and
melchishua
saul's
sons
and
the
battle
went
sore
against
saul
and
the
archers
hit
him
and
he
was
sore
wounded
of
the
archers
then
said
saul
unto
his
armourbearer
draw
thy
sword
and
thrust
me
through
therewith
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
thrust
me
through
and
abuse
me
but
his
armourbearer
would
not
for
he
was
sore
afraid
therefore
saul
took
a
sword
and
fell
upon
it
and
when
his
armourbearer
saw
that
saul
was
dead
he
fell
likewise
upon
his
sword
and
died
with
him
so
saul
died
and
his
three
sons
and
his
armourbearer
and
all
his
men
that
same
day
together
and
when
the
men
of
israel
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
and
they
that
were
on
the
other
side
jordan
saw
that
the
men
of
israel
fled
and
that
saul
and
his
sons
were
dead
they
forsook
the
cities
and
fled
and
the
philistines
came
and
dwelt
in
them
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
when
the
philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain
that
they
found
saul
and
his
three
sons
fallen
in
mount
gilboa
and
they
cut
off
his
head
and
stripped
off
his
armour
and
sent
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
round
about
to
publish
it
in
the
house
of
their
idols
and
among
the
people
and
they
put
his
armour
in
the
house
of
ashtaroth
and
they
fastened
his
body
to
the
wall
of
bethshan
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
jabeshgilead
heard
of
that
which
the
philistines
had
done
to
saul
all
the
valiant
men
arose
and
went
all
night
and
took
the
body
of
saul
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons
from
the
wall
of
bethshan
and
came
to
jabesh
and
burnt
them
there
and
they
took
their
bones
and
buried
them
under
a
tree
at
jabesh
and
fasted
seven
days
the
second
book
of
samuel
otherwise
called
the
second
book
of
the
kings
now
it
came
to
pass
after
the
death
of
saul
when
david
was
returned
from
the
slaughter
of
the
amalekites
and
david
had
abode
two
days
in
ziklag
it
came
even
to
pass
on
the
third
day
that
behold
a
man
came
out
of
the
camp
from
saul
with
his
clothes
rent
and
earth
upon
his
head
and
so
it
was
when
he
came
to
david
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
did
obeisance
and
david
said
unto
him
from
whence
comest
thou
and
he
said
unto
him
out
of
the
camp
of
israel
am
i
escaped
and
david
said
unto
him
how
went
the
matter
i
pray
thee
tell
me
and
he
answered
that
the
people
are
fled
from
the
battle
and
many
of
the
people
also
are
fallen
and
dead
and
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
are
dead
also
and
david
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
how
knowest
thou
that
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
be
dead
and
the
young
man
that
told
him
said
as
i
happened
by
chance
upon
mount
gilboa
behold
saul
leaned
upon
his
spear
and
lo
the
chariots
and
horsemen
followed
hard
after
him
and
when
he
looked
behind
him
he
saw
me
and
called
unto
me
and
i
answered
here
am
i
and
he
said
unto
me
who
art
thou
and
i
answered
him
i
am
an
amalekite
he
said
unto
me
again
stand
i
pray
thee
upon
me
and
slay
me
for
anguish
is
come
upon
me
because
my
life
is
yet
whole
in
me
so
i
stood
upon
him
and
slew
him
because
i
was
sure
that
he
could
not
live
after
that
he
was
fallen
and
i
took
the
crown
that
was
upon
his
head
and
the
bracelet
that
was
on
his
arm
and
have
brought
them
hither
unto
my
lord
then
david
took
hold
on
his
clothes
and
rent
them
and
likewise
all
the
men
that
were
with
him
and
they
mourned
and
wept
and
fasted
until
even
for
saul
and
for
jonathan
his
son
and
for
the
people
of
the
lord
and
for
the
house
of
israel
because
they
were
fallen
by
the
sword
and
david
said
unto
the
young
man
that
told
him
whence
art
thou
and
he
answered
i
am
the
son
of
a
stranger
an
amalekite
and
david
said
unto
him
how
wast
thou
not
afraid
to
stretch
forth
thine
hand
to
destroy
the
lord's
anointed
and
david
called
one
of
the
young
men
and
said
go
near
and
fall
upon
him
and
he
smote
him
that
he
died
and
david
said
unto
him
thy
blood
be
upon
thy
head
for
thy
mouth
hath
testified
against
thee
saying
i
have
slain
the
lord's
anointed
and
david
lamented
with
this
lamentation
over
saul
and
over
jonathan
his
son
also
he
bade
them
teach
the
children
of
judah
the
use
of
the
bow
behold
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
jasher
the
beauty
of
israel
is
slain
upon
thy
high
places
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
tell
it
not
in
gath
publish
it
not
in
the
streets
of
askelon
lest
the
daughters
of
the
philistines
rejoice
lest
the
daughters
of
the
uncircumcised
triumph
ye
mountains
of
gilboa
let
there
be
no
dew
neither
let
there
be
rain
upon
you
nor
fields
of
offerings
for
there
the
shield
of
the
mighty
is
vilely
cast
away
the
shield
of
saul
as
though
he
had
not
been
anointed
with
oil
from
the
blood
of
the
slain
from
the
fat
of
the
mighty
the
bow
of
jonathan
turned
not
back
and
the
sword
of
saul
returned
not
empty
saul
and
jonathan
were
lovely
and
pleasant
in
their
lives
and
in
their
death
they
were
not
divided
they
were
swifter
than
eagles
they
were
stronger
than
lions
ye
daughters
of
israel
weep
over
saul
who
clothed
you
in
scarlet
with
other
delights
who
put
on
ornaments
of
gold
upon
your
apparel
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
o
jonathan
thou
wast
slain
in
thine
high
places
i
am
distressed
for
thee
my
brother
jonathan
very
pleasant
hast
thou
been
unto
me
thy
love
to
me
was
wonderful
passing
the
love
of
women
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
and
the
weapons
of
war
perished
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
up
into
any
of
the
cities
of
judah
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
up
and
david
said
whither
shall
i
go
up
and
he
said
unto
hebron
so
david
went
up
thither
and
his
two
wives
also
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
abigail
nabal's
wife
the
carmelite
and
his
men
that
were
with
him
did
david
bring
up
every
man
with
his
household
and
they
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
hebron
and
the
men
of
judah
came
and
there
they
anointed
david
king
over
the
house
of
judah
and
they
told
david
saying
that
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
were
they
that
buried
saul
and
david
sent
messengers
unto
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
and
said
unto
them
blessed
be
ye
of
the
lord
that
ye
have
shewed
this
kindness
unto
your
lord
even
unto
saul
and
have
buried
him
and
now
the
lord
shew
kindness
and
truth
unto
you
and
i
also
will
requite
you
this
kindness
because
ye
have
done
this
thing
therefore
now
let
your
hands
be
strengthened
and
be
ye
valiant
for
your
master
saul
is
dead
and
also
the
house
of
judah
have
anointed
me
king
over
them
but
abner
the
son
of
ner
captain
of
saul's
host
took
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
and
brought
him
over
to
mahanaim
and
made
him
king
over
gilead
and
over
the
ashurites
and
over
jezreel
and
over
ephraim
and
over
benjamin
and
over
all
israel
ishbosheth
saul's
son
was
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
over
israel
and
reigned
two
years
but
the
house
of
judah
followed
david
and
the
time
that
david
was
king
in
hebron
over
the
house
of
judah
was
seven
years
and
six
months
and
abner
the
son
of
ner
and
the
servants
of
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
went
out
from
mahanaim
to
gibeon
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
and
the
servants
of
david
went
out
and
met
together
by
the
pool
of
gibeon
and
they
sat
down
the
one
on
the
one
side
of
the
pool
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
and
abner
said
to
joab
let
the
young
men
now
arise
and
play
before
us
and
joab
said
let
them
arise
then
there
arose
and
went
over
by
number
twelve
of
benjamin
which
pertained
to
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
and
twelve
of
the
servants
of
david
and
they
caught
every
one
his
fellow
by
the
head
and
thrust
his
sword
in
his
fellow's
side
so
they
fell
down
together
wherefore
that
place
was
called
helkathhazzurim
which
is
in
gibeon
and
there
was
a
very
sore
battle
that
day
and
abner
was
beaten
and
the
men
of
israel
before
the
servants
of
david
and
there
were
three
sons
of
zeruiah
there
joab
and
abishai
and
asahel
and
asahel
was
as
light
of
foot
as
a
wild
roe
and
asahel
pursued
after
abner
and
in
going
he
turned
not
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
from
following
abner
then
abner
looked
behind
him
and
said
art
thou
asahel
and
he
answered
i
am
and
abner
said
to
him
turn
thee
aside
to
thy
right
hand
or
to
thy
left
and
lay
thee
hold
on
one
of
the
young
men
and
take
thee
his
armour
but
asahel
would
not
turn
aside
from
following
of
him
and
abner
said
again
to
asahel
turn
thee
aside
from
following
me
wherefore
should
i
smite
thee
to
the
ground
how
then
should
i
hold
up
my
face
to
joab
thy
brother
howbeit
he
refused
to
turn
aside
wherefore
abner
with
the
hinder
end
of
the
spear
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib
that
the
spear
came
out
behind
him
and
he
fell
down
there
and
died
in
the
same
place
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
came
to
the
place
where
asahel
fell
down
and
died
stood
still
joab
also
and
abishai
pursued
after
abner
and
the
sun
went
down
when
they
were
come
to
the
hill
of
ammah
that
lieth
before
giah
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
gibeon
and
the
children
of
benjamin
gathered
themselves
together
after
abner
and
became
one
troop
and
stood
on
the
top
of
an
hill
then
abner
called
to
joab
and
said
shall
the
sword
devour
for
ever
knowest
thou
not
that
it
will
be
bitterness
in
the
latter
end
how
long
shall
it
be
then
ere
thou
bid
the
people
return
from
following
their
brethren
and
joab
said
as
god
liveth
unless
thou
hadst
spoken
surely
then
in
the
morning
the
people
had
gone
up
every
one
from
following
his
brother
so
joab
blew
a
trumpet
and
all
the
people
stood
still
and
pursued
after
israel
no
more
neither
fought
they
any
more
and
abner
and
his
men
walked
all
that
night
through
the
plain
and
passed
over
jordan
and
went
through
all
bithron
and
they
came
to
mahanaim
and
joab
returned
from
following
abner
and
when
he
had
gathered
all
the
people
together
there
lacked
of
david's
servants
nineteen
men
and
asahel
but
the
servants
of
david
had
smitten
of
benjamin
and
of
abner's
men
so
that
three
hundred
and
threescore
men
died
and
they
took
up
asahel
and
buried
him
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father
which
was
in
bethlehem
and
joab
and
his
men
went
all
night
and
they
came
to
hebron
at
break
of
day
now
there
was
long
war
between
the
house
of
saul
and
the
house
of
david
but
david
waxed
stronger
and
stronger
and
the
house
of
saul
waxed
weaker
and
weaker
and
unto
david
were
sons
born
in
hebron
and
his
firstborn
was
amnon
of
ahinoam
the
jezreelitess
and
his
second
chileab
of
abigail
the
wife
of
nabal
the
carmelite
and
the
third
absalom
the
son
of
maacah
the
daughter
of
talmai
king
of
geshur
and
the
fourth
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
and
the
fifth
shephatiah
the
son
of
abital
and
the
sixth
ithream
by
eglah
david's
wife
these
were
born
to
david
in
hebron
and
it
came
to
pass
while
there
was
war
between
the
house
of
saul
and
the
house
of
david
that
abner
made
himself
strong
for
the
house
of
saul
and
saul
had
a
concubine
whose
name
was
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
and
ishbosheth
said
to
abner
wherefore
hast
thou
gone
in
unto
my
father's
concubine
then
was
abner
very
wroth
for
the
words
of
ishbosheth
and
said
am
i
a
dog's
head
which
against
judah
do
shew
kindness
this
day
unto
the
house
of
saul
thy
father
to
his
brethren
and
to
his
friends
and
have
not
delivered
thee
into
the
hand
of
david
that
thou
chargest
me
to
day
with
a
fault
concerning
this
woman
so
do
god
to
abner
and
more
also
except
as
the
lord
hath
sworn
to
david
even
so
i
do
to
him
to
translate
the
kingdom
from
the
house
of
saul
and
to
set
up
the
throne
of
david
over
israel
and
over
judah
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
and
he
could
not
answer
abner
a
word
again
because
he
feared
him
and
abner
sent
messengers
to
david
on
his
behalf
saying
whose
is
the
land
saying
also
make
thy
league
with
me
and
behold
my
hand
shall
be
with
thee
to
bring
about
all
israel
unto
thee
and
he
said
well
i
will
make
a
league
with
thee
but
one
thing
i
require
of
thee
that
is
thou
shalt
not
see
my
face
except
thou
first
bring
michal
saul's
daughter
when
thou
comest
to
see
my
face
and
david
sent
messengers
to
ishbosheth
saul's
son
saying
deliver
me
my
wife
michal
which
i
espoused
to
me
for
an
hundred
foreskins
of
the
philistines
and
ishbosheth
sent
and
took
her
from
her
husband
even
from
phaltiel
the
son
of
laish
and
her
husband
went
with
her
along
weeping
behind
her
to
bahurim
then
said
abner
unto
him
go
return
and
he
returned
and
abner
had
communication
with
the
elders
of
israel
saying
ye
sought
for
david
in
times
past
to
be
king
over
you
now
then
do
it
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
of
david
saying
by
the
hand
of
my
servant
david
i
will
save
my
people
israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
out
of
the
hand
of
all
their
enemies
and
abner
also
spake
in
the
ears
of
benjamin
and
abner
went
also
to
speak
in
the
ears
of
david
in
hebron
all
that
seemed
good
to
israel
and
that
seemed
good
to
the
whole
house
of
benjamin
so
abner
came
to
david
to
hebron
and
twenty
men
with
him
and
david
made
abner
and
the
men
that
were
with
him
a
feast
and
abner
said
unto
david
i
will
arise
and
go
and
will
gather
all
israel
unto
my
lord
the
king
that
they
may
make
a
league
with
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
reign
over
all
that
thine
heart
desireth
and
david
sent
abner
away
and
he
went
in
peace
and
behold
the
servants
of
david
and
joab
came
from
pursuing
a
troop
and
brought
in
a
great
spoil
with
them
but
abner
was
not
with
david
in
hebron
for
he
had
sent
him
away
and
he
was
gone
in
peace
when
joab
and
all
the
host
that
was
with
him
were
come
they
told
joab
saying
abner
the
son
of
ner
came
to
the
king
and
he
hath
sent
him
away
and
he
is
gone
in
peace
then
joab
came
to
the
king
and
said
what
hast
thou
done
behold
abner
came
unto
thee
why
is
it
that
thou
hast
sent
him
away
and
he
is
quite
gone
thou
knowest
abner
the
son
of
ner
that
he
came
to
deceive
thee
and
to
know
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
to
know
all
that
thou
doest
and
when
joab
was
come
out
from
david
he
sent
messengers
after
abner
which
brought
him
again
from
the
well
of
sirah
but
david
knew
it
not
and
when
abner
was
returned
to
hebron
joab
took
him
aside
in
the
gate
to
speak
with
him
quietly
and
smote
him
there
under
the
fifth
rib
that
he
died
for
the
blood
of
asahel
his
brother
and
afterward
when
david
heard
it
he
said
i
and
my
kingdom
are
guiltless
before
the
lord
for
ever
from
the
blood
of
abner
the
son
of
ner
let
it
rest
on
the
head
of
joab
and
on
all
his
father's
house
and
let
there
not
fail
from
the
house
of
joab
one
that
hath
an
issue
or
that
is
a
leper
or
that
leaneth
on
a
staff
or
that
falleth
on
the
sword
or
that
lacketh
bread
so
joab
and
abishai
his
brother
slew
abner
because
he
had
slain
their
brother
asahel
at
gibeon
in
the
battle
and
david
said
to
joab
and
to
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
rend
your
clothes
and
gird
you
with
sackcloth
and
mourn
before
abner
and
king
david
himself
followed
the
bier
and
they
buried
abner
in
hebron
and
the
king
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
at
the
grave
of
abner
and
all
the
people
wept
and
the
king
lamented
over
abner
and
said
died
abner
as
a
fool
dieth
thy
hands
were
not
bound
nor
thy
feet
put
into
fetters
as
a
man
falleth
before
wicked
men
so
fellest
thou
and
all
the
people
wept
again
over
him
and
when
all
the
people
came
to
cause
david
to
eat
meat
while
it
was
yet
day
david
sware
saying
so
do
god
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
taste
bread
or
ought
else
till
the
sun
be
down
and
all
the
people
took
notice
of
it
and
it
pleased
them
as
whatsoever
the
king
did
pleased
all
the
people
for
all
the
people
and
all
israel
understood
that
day
that
it
was
not
of
the
king
to
slay
abner
the
son
of
ner
and
the
king
said
unto
his
servants
know
ye
not
that
there
is
a
prince
and
a
great
man
fallen
this
day
in
israel
and
i
am
this
day
weak
though
anointed
king
and
these
men
the
sons
of
zeruiah
be
too
hard
for
me
the
lord
shall
reward
the
doer
of
evil
according
to
his
wickedness
and
when
saul's
son
heard
that
abner
was
dead
in
hebron
his
hands
were
feeble
and
all
the
israelites
were
troubled
and
saul's
son
had
two
men
that
were
captains
of
bands
the
name
of
the
one
was
baanah
and
the
name
of
the
other
rechab
the
sons
of
rimmon
a
beerothite
of
the
children
of
benjamin
for
beeroth
also
was
reckoned
to
benjamin
and
the
beerothites
fled
to
gittaim
and
were
sojourners
there
until
this
day
and
jonathan
saul's
son
had
a
son
that
was
lame
of
his
feet
he
was
five
years
old
when
the
tidings
came
of
saul
and
jonathan
out
of
jezreel
and
his
nurse
took
him
up
and
fled
and
it
came
to
pass
as
she
made
haste
to
flee
that
he
fell
and
became
lame
and
his
name
was
mephibosheth
and
the
sons
of
rimmon
the
beerothite
rechab
and
baanah
went
and
came
about
the
heat
of
the
day
to
the
house
of
ishbosheth
who
lay
on
a
bed
at
noon
and
they
came
thither
into
the
midst
of
the
house
as
though
they
would
have
fetched
wheat
and
they
smote
him
under
the
fifth
rib
and
rechab
and
baanah
his
brother
escaped
for
when
they
came
into
the
house
he
lay
on
his
bed
in
his
bedchamber
and
they
smote
him
and
slew
him
and
beheaded
him
and
took
his
head
and
gat
them
away
through
the
plain
all
night
and
they
brought
the
head
of
ishbosheth
unto
david
to
hebron
and
said
to
the
king
behold
the
head
of
ishbosheth
the
son
of
saul
thine
enemy
which
sought
thy
life
and
the
lord
hath
avenged
my
lord
the
king
this
day
of
saul
and
of
his
seed
and
david
answered
rechab
and
baanah
his
brother
the
sons
of
rimmon
the
beerothite
and
said
unto
them
as
the
lord
liveth
who
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
adversity
when
one
told
me
saying
behold
saul
is
dead
thinking
to
have
brought
good
tidings
i
took
hold
of
him
and
slew
him
in
ziklag
who
thought
that
i
would
have
given
him
a
reward
for
his
tidings
how
much
more
when
wicked
men
have
slain
a
righteous
person
in
his
own
house
upon
his
bed
shall
i
not
therefore
now
require
his
blood
of
your
hand
and
take
you
away
from
the
earth
and
david
commanded
his
young
men
and
they
slew
them
and
cut
off
their
hands
and
their
feet
and
hanged
them
up
over
the
pool
in
hebron
but
they
took
the
head
of
ishbosheth
and
buried
it
in
the
sepulchre
of
abner
in
hebron
then
came
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
david
unto
hebron
and
spake
saying
behold
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh
also
in
time
past
when
saul
was
king
over
us
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
israel
and
the
lord
said
to
thee
thou
shalt
feed
my
people
israel
and
thou
shalt
be
a
captain
over
israel
so
all
the
elders
of
israel
came
to
the
king
to
hebron
and
king
david
made
a
league
with
them
in
hebron
before
the
lord
and
they
anointed
david
king
over
israel
david
was
thirty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
forty
years
in
hebron
he
reigned
over
judah
seven
years
and
six
months
and
in
jerusalem
he
reigned
thirty
and
three
years
over
all
israel
and
judah
and
the
king
and
his
men
went
to
jerusalem
unto
the
jebusites
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
which
spake
unto
david
saying
except
thou
take
away
the
blind
and
the
lame
thou
shalt
not
come
in
hither
thinking
david
cannot
come
in
hither
nevertheless
david
took
the
strong
hold
of
zion
the
same
is
the
city
of
david
and
david
said
on
that
day
whosoever
getteth
up
to
the
gutter
and
smiteth
the
jebusites
and
the
lame
and
the
blind
that
are
hated
of
david's
soul
he
shall
be
chief
and
captain
wherefore
they
said
the
blind
and
the
lame
shall
not
come
into
the
house
so
david
dwelt
in
the
fort
and
called
it
the
city
of
david
and
david
built
round
about
from
millo
and
inward
and
david
went
on
and
grew
great
and
the
lord
god
of
hosts
was
with
him
and
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
messengers
to
david
and
cedar
trees
and
carpenters
and
masons
and
they
built
david
an
house
and
david
perceived
that
the
lord
had
established
him
king
over
israel
and
that
he
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
his
people
israel's
sake
and
david
took
him
more
concubines
and
wives
out
of
jerusalem
after
he
was
come
from
hebron
and
there
were
yet
sons
and
daughters
born
to
david
and
these
be
the
names
of
those
that
were
born
unto
him
in
jerusalem
shammuah
and
shobab
and
nathan
and
solomon
ibhar
also
and
elishua
and
nepheg
and
japhia
and
elishama
and
eliada
and
eliphalet
but
when
the
philistines
heard
that
they
had
anointed
david
king
over
israel
all
the
philistines
came
up
to
seek
david
and
david
heard
of
it
and
went
down
to
the
hold
the
philistines
also
came
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
and
david
enquired
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
go
up
to
the
philistines
wilt
thou
deliver
them
into
mine
hand
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
go
up
for
i
will
doubtless
deliver
the
philistines
into
thine
hand
and
david
came
to
baalperazim
and
david
smote
them
there
and
said
the
lord
hath
broken
forth
upon
mine
enemies
before
me
as
the
breach
of
waters
therefore
he
called
the
name
of
that
place
baalperazim
and
there
they
left
their
images
and
david
and
his
men
burned
them
and
the
philistines
came
up
yet
again
and
spread
themselves
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
and
when
david
enquired
of
the
lord
he
said
thou
shalt
not
go
up
but
fetch
a
compass
behind
them
and
come
upon
them
over
against
the
mulberry
trees
and
let
it
be
when
thou
hearest
the
sound
of
a
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
that
then
thou
shalt
bestir
thyself
for
then
shall
the
lord
go
out
before
thee
to
smite
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
david
did
so
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
smote
the
philistines
from
geba
until
thou
come
to
gazer
again
david
gathered
together
all
the
chosen
men
of
israel
thirty
thousand
and
david
arose
and
went
with
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
from
baale
of
judah
to
bring
up
from
thence
the
ark
of
god
whose
name
is
called
by
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
that
dwelleth
between
the
cherubims
and
they
set
the
ark
of
god
upon
a
new
cart
and
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
that
was
in
gibeah
and
uzzah
and
ahio
the
sons
of
abinadab
drave
the
new
cart
and
they
brought
it
out
of
the
house
of
abinadab
which
was
at
gibeah
accompanying
the
ark
of
god
and
ahio
went
before
the
ark
and
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
played
before
the
lord
on
all
manner
of
instruments
made
of
fir
wood
even
on
harps
and
on
psalteries
and
on
timbrels
and
on
cornets
and
on
cymbals
and
when
they
came
to
nachon's
threshingfloor
uzzah
put
forth
his
hand
to
the
ark
of
god
and
took
hold
of
it
for
the
oxen
shook
it
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
uzzah
and
god
smote
him
there
for
his
error
and
there
he
died
by
the
ark
of
god
and
david
was
displeased
because
the
lord
had
made
a
breach
upon
uzzah
and
he
called
the
name
of
the
place
perezuzzah
to
this
day
and
david
was
afraid
of
the
lord
that
day
and
said
how
shall
the
ark
of
the
lord
come
to
me
so
david
would
not
remove
the
ark
of
the
lord
unto
him
into
the
city
of
david
but
david
carried
it
aside
into
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
and
the
ark
of
the
lord
continued
in
the
house
of
obededom
the
gittite
three
months
and
the
lord
blessed
obededom
and
all
his
household
and
it
was
told
king
david
saying
the
lord
hath
blessed
the
house
of
obededom
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
him
because
of
the
ark
of
god
so
david
went
and
brought
up
the
ark
of
god
from
the
house
of
obededom
into
the
city
of
david
with
gladness
and
it
was
so
that
when
they
that
bare
the
ark
of
the
lord
had
gone
six
paces
he
sacrificed
oxen
and
fatlings
and
david
danced
before
the
lord
with
all
his
might
and
david
was
girded
with
a
linen
ephod
so
david
and
all
the
house
of
israel
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
with
shouting
and
with
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
as
the
ark
of
the
lord
came
into
the
city
of
david
michal
saul's
daughter
looked
through
a
window
and
saw
king
david
leaping
and
dancing
before
the
lord
and
she
despised
him
in
her
heart
and
they
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
set
it
in
his
place
in
the
midst
of
the
tabernacle
that
david
had
pitched
for
it
and
david
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
before
the
lord
and
as
soon
as
david
had
made
an
end
of
offering
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
he
dealt
among
all
the
people
even
among
the
whole
multitude
of
israel
as
well
to
the
women
as
men
to
every
one
a
cake
of
bread
and
a
good
piece
of
flesh
and
a
flagon
of
wine
so
all
the
people
departed
every
one
to
his
house
then
david
returned
to
bless
his
household
and
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
came
out
to
meet
david
and
said
how
glorious
was
the
king
of
israel
to
day
who
uncovered
himself
to
day
in
the
eyes
of
the
handmaids
of
his
servants
as
one
of
the
vain
fellows
shamelessly
uncovereth
himself
and
david
said
unto
michal
it
was
before
the
lord
which
chose
me
before
thy
father
and
before
all
his
house
to
appoint
me
ruler
over
the
people
of
the
lord
over
israel
therefore
will
i
play
before
the
lord
and
i
will
yet
be
more
vile
than
thus
and
will
be
base
in
mine
own
sight
and
of
the
maidservants
which
thou
hast
spoken
of
of
them
shall
i
be
had
in
honour
therefore
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
had
no
child
unto
the
day
of
her
death
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
sat
in
his
house
and
the
lord
had
given
him
rest
round
about
from
all
his
enemies
that
the
king
said
unto
nathan
the
prophet
see
now
i
dwell
in
an
house
of
cedar
but
the
ark
of
god
dwelleth
within
curtains
and
nathan
said
to
the
king
go
do
all
that
is
in
thine
heart
for
the
lord
is
with
thee
and
it
came
to
pass
that
night
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
nathan
saying
go
and
tell
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
shalt
thou
build
me
an
house
for
me
to
dwell
in
whereas
i
have
not
dwelt
in
any
house
since
the
time
that
i
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
even
to
this
day
but
have
walked
in
a
tent
and
in
a
tabernacle
in
all
the
places
wherein
i
have
walked
with
all
the
children
of
israel
spake
i
a
word
with
any
of
the
tribes
of
israel
whom
i
commanded
to
feed
my
people
israel
saying
why
build
ye
not
me
an
house
of
cedar
now
therefore
so
shalt
thou
say
unto
my
servant
david
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
took
thee
from
the
sheepcote
from
following
the
sheep
to
be
ruler
over
my
people
over
israel
and
i
was
with
thee
whithersoever
thou
wentest
and
have
cut
off
all
thine
enemies
out
of
thy
sight
and
have
made
thee
a
great
name
like
unto
the
name
of
the
great
men
that
are
in
the
earth
moreover
i
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
israel
and
will
plant
them
that
they
may
dwell
in
a
place
of
their
own
and
move
no
more
neither
shall
the
children
of
wickedness
afflict
them
any
more
as
beforetime
and
as
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
israel
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
also
the
lord
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
house
and
when
thy
days
be
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
i
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
thee
which
shall
proceed
out
of
thy
bowels
and
i
will
establish
his
kingdom
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
i
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
ever
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
if
he
commit
iniquity
i
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of
men
and
with
the
stripes
of
the
children
of
men
but
my
mercy
shall
not
depart
away
from
him
as
i
took
it
from
saul
whom
i
put
away
before
thee
and
thine
house
and
thy
kingdom
shall
be
established
for
ever
before
thee
thy
throne
shall
be
established
for
ever
according
to
all
these
words
and
according
to
all
this
vision
so
did
nathan
speak
unto
david
then
went
king
david
in
and
sat
before
the
lord
and
he
said
who
am
i
o
lord
god
and
what
is
my
house
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hitherto
and
this
was
yet
a
small
thing
in
thy
sight
o
lord
god
but
thou
hast
spoken
also
of
thy
servant's
house
for
a
great
while
to
come
and
is
this
the
manner
of
man
o
lord
god
and
what
can
david
say
more
unto
thee
for
thou
lord
god
knowest
thy
servant
for
thy
word's
sake
and
according
to
thine
own
heart
hast
thou
done
all
these
great
things
to
make
thy
servant
know
them
wherefore
thou
art
great
o
lord
god
for
there
is
none
like
thee
neither
is
there
any
god
beside
thee
according
to
all
that
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
and
what
one
nation
in
the
earth
is
like
thy
people
even
like
israel
whom
god
went
to
redeem
for
a
people
to
himself
and
to
make
him
a
name
and
to
do
for
you
great
things
and
terrible
for
thy
land
before
thy
people
which
thou
redeemedst
to
thee
from
egypt
from
the
nations
and
their
gods
for
thou
hast
confirmed
to
thyself
thy
people
israel
to
be
a
people
unto
thee
for
ever
and
thou
lord
art
become
their
god
and
now
o
lord
god
the
word
that
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
thy
servant
and
concerning
his
house
establish
it
for
ever
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
and
let
thy
name
be
magnified
for
ever
saying
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
god
over
israel
and
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
david
be
established
before
thee
for
thou
o
lord
of
hosts
god
of
israel
hast
revealed
to
thy
servant
saying
i
will
build
thee
an
house
therefore
hath
thy
servant
found
in
his
heart
to
pray
this
prayer
unto
thee
and
now
o
lord
god
thou
art
that
god
and
thy
words
be
true
and
thou
hast
promised
this
goodness
unto
thy
servant
therefore
now
let
it
please
thee
to
bless
the
house
of
thy
servant
that
it
may
continue
for
ever
before
thee
for
thou
o
lord
god
hast
spoken
it
and
with
thy
blessing
let
the
house
of
thy
servant
be
blessed
for
ever
and
after
this
it
came
to
pass
that
david
smote
the
philistines
and
subdued
them
and
david
took
methegammah
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
he
smote
moab
and
measured
them
with
a
line
casting
them
down
to
the
ground
even
with
two
lines
measured
he
to
put
to
death
and
with
one
full
line
to
keep
alive
and
so
the
moabites
became
david's
servants
and
brought
gifts
david
smote
also
hadadezer
the
son
of
rehob
king
of
zobah
as
he
went
to
recover
his
border
at
the
river
euphrates
and
david
took
from
him
a
thousand
chariots
and
seven
hundred
horsemen
and
twenty
thousand
footmen
and
david
houghed
all
the
chariot
horses
but
reserved
of
them
for
an
hundred
chariots
and
when
the
syrians
of
damascus
came
to
succour
hadadezer
king
of
zobah
david
slew
of
the
syrians
two
and
twenty
thousand
men
then
david
put
garrisons
in
syria
of
damascus
and
the
syrians
became
servants
to
david
and
brought
gifts
and
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
and
david
took
the
shields
of
gold
that
were
on
the
servants
of
hadadezer
and
brought
them
to
jerusalem
and
from
betah
and
from
berothai
cities
of
hadadezer
king
david
took
exceeding
much
brass
when
toi
king
of
hamath
heard
that
david
had
smitten
all
the
host
of
hadadezer
then
toi
sent
joram
his
son
unto
king
david
to
salute
him
and
to
bless
him
because
he
had
fought
against
hadadezer
and
smitten
him
for
hadadezer
had
wars
with
toi
and
joram
brought
with
him
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
and
vessels
of
brass
which
also
king
david
did
dedicate
unto
the
lord
with
the
silver
and
gold
that
he
had
dedicated
of
all
nations
which
he
subdued
of
syria
and
of
moab
and
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
of
the
philistines
and
of
amalek
and
of
the
spoil
of
hadadezer
son
of
rehob
king
of
zobah
and
david
gat
him
a
name
when
he
returned
from
smiting
of
the
syrians
in
the
valley
of
salt
being
eighteen
thousand
men
and
he
put
garrisons
in
edom
throughout
all
edom
put
he
garrisons
and
all
they
of
edom
became
david's
servants
and
the
lord
preserved
david
whithersoever
he
went
and
david
reigned
over
all
israel
and
david
executed
judgment
and
justice
unto
all
his
people
and
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
over
the
host
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
was
recorder
and
zadok
the

rulers
and
david
said
is
there
yet
any
that
is
left
of
the
house
of
saul
that
i
may
shew
him
kindness
for
jonathan's
sake
and
there
was
of
the
house
of
saul
a
servant
whose
name
was
ziba
and
when
they
had
called
him
unto
david
the
king
said
unto
him
art
thou
ziba
and
he
said
thy
servant
is
he
and
the
king
said
is
there
not
yet
any
of
the
house
of
saul
that
i
may
shew
the
kindness
of
god
unto
him
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
jonathan
hath
yet
a
son
which
is
lame
on
his
feet
and
the
king
said
unto
him
where
is
he
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
behold
he
is
in
the
house
of
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
in
lodebar
then
king
david
sent
and
fetched
him
out
of
the
house
of
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
from
lodebar
now
when

the
son
of

the
son
of
saul
was
come
unto
david
he
fell
on
his
face
and
did
reverence
and
david
said
mephibosheth
and
he
answered
behold
thy
servant
and
david
said
unto
him
fear
not
for
i
will
surely
shew
thee
kindness
for
jonathan
thy
father's
sake
and
will
restore
thee
all
the
land
of
saul
thy
father
and
thou
shalt
eat
bread
at
my
table
continually
and
he
bowed
himself
and
said
what
is
thy
servant
that
thou
shouldest
look
upon
such
a
dead
dog
as
i
am
then
the
king
called
to
ziba
saul's
servant
and
said
unto
him
i
have
given
unto
thy
master's
son
all
that
pertained
to
saul
and
to
all
his
house
thou
therefore
and
thy
sons
and
thy
servants
shall
till
the
land
for
him
and
thou
shalt
bring
in
the
fruits
that
thy
master's
son
may
have
food
to
eat
but
mephibosheth
thy
master's
son
shall
eat
bread
alway
at
my
table
now
ziba
had
fifteen
sons
and
twenty
servants
then
said
ziba
unto
the
king
according
to
all
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
commanded
his
servant
so
shall
thy
servant
do
as
for
mephibosheth
said
the
king
he
shall
eat
at
my
table
as
one
of
the
king's
sons
and
mephibosheth
had
a
young
son
whose
name
was
micha
and
all
that
dwelt
in
the
house
of
ziba
were
servants
unto
mephibosheth
so
mephibosheth
dwelt
in
jerusalem
for
he
did
eat
continually
at
the
king's
table
and
was
lame
on
both
his
feet
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
died
and
hanun
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
then
said
david
i
will
shew
kindness
unto
hanun
the
son
of
nahash
as
his
father
shewed
kindness
unto
me
and
david
sent
to
comfort
him
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
for
his
father
and
david's
servants
came
into
the
land
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
princes
of
the
children
of
ammon
said
unto
hanun
their
lord
thinkest
thou
that
david
doth
honour
thy
father
that
he
hath
sent
comforters
unto
thee
hath
not
david
rather
sent
his
servants
unto
thee
to
search
the
city
and
to
spy
it
out
and
to
overthrow
it
wherefore
hanun
took
david's
servants
and
shaved
off
the
one
half
of
their
beards
and
cut
off
their
garments
in
the
middle
even
to
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
when
they
told
it
unto
david
he
sent
to
meet
them
because
the
men
were
greatly
ashamed
and
the
king
said
tarry
at
jericho
until
your
beards
be
grown
and
then
return
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
they
stank
before
david
the
children
of
ammon
sent
and
hired
the
syrians
of
bethrehob
and
the
syrians
of
zoba
twenty
thousand
footmen
and
of
king
maacah
a
thousand
men
and
of
ishtob
twelve
thousand
men
and
when
david
heard
of
it
he
sent
joab
and
all
the
host
of
the
mighty
men
and
the
children
of
ammon
came
out
and
put
the
battle
in
array
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
and
the
syrians
of
zoba
and
of
rehob
and
ishtob
and
maacah
were
by
themselves
in
the
field
when
joab
saw
that
the
front
of
the
battle
was
against
him
before
and
behind
he
chose
of
all
the
choice
men
of
israel
and
put
them
in
array
against
the
syrians
and
the
rest
of
the
people
he
delivered
into
the
hand
of
abishai
his
brother
that
he
might
put
them
in
array
against
the
children
of
ammon
and
he
said
if
the
syrians
be
too
strong
for
me
then
thou
shalt
help
me
but
if
the
children
of
ammon
be
too
strong
for
thee
then
i
will
come
and
help
thee
be
of
good
courage
and
let
us
play
the
men
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
god
and
the
lord
do
that
which
seemeth
him
good
and
joab
drew
nigh
and
the
people
that
were
with
him
unto
the
battle
against
the
syrians
and
they
fled
before
him
and
when
the
children
of
ammon
saw
that
the
syrians
were
fled
then
fled
they
also
before
abishai
and
entered
into
the
city
so
joab
returned
from
the
children
of
ammon
and
came
to
jerusalem
and
when
the
syrians
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
israel
they
gathered
themselves
together
and
hadarezer
sent
and
brought
out
the
syrians
that
were
beyond
the
river
and
they
came
to
helam
and
shobach
the
captain
of
the
host
of
hadarezer
went
before
them
and
when
it
was
told
david
he
gathered
all
israel
together
and
passed
over
jordan
and
came
to
helam
and
the
syrians
set
themselves
in
array
against
david
and
fought
with
him
and
the
syrians
fled
before
israel
and
david
slew
the
men
of
seven
hundred
chariots
of
the
syrians
and
forty
thousand
horsemen
and
smote
shobach
the
captain
of
their
host
who
died
there
and
when
all
the
kings
that
were
servants
to
hadarezer
saw
that
they
were
smitten
before
israel
they
made
peace
with
israel
and
served
them
so
the
syrians
feared
to
help
the
children
of
ammon
any
more
and
it
came
to
pass
after
the
year
was
expired
at
the
time
when
kings
go
forth
to
battle
that
david
sent
joab
and
his
servants
with
him
and
all
israel
and
they
destroyed
the
children
of
ammon
and
besieged
rabbah
but
david
tarried
still
at
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
in
an
eveningtide
that
david
arose
from
off
his
bed
and
walked
upon
the
roof
of
the
king's
house
and
from
the
roof
he
saw
a
woman
washing
herself
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
to
look
upon
and
david
sent
and
enquired
after
the
woman
and
one
said
is
not
this
bathsheba
the
daughter
of
eliam
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
and
david
sent
messengers
and
took
her
and
she
came
in
unto
him
and
he
lay
with
her
for
she
was
purified
from
her
uncleanness
and
she
returned
unto
her
house
and
the
woman
conceived
and
sent
and
told
david
and
said
i
am
with
child
and
david
sent
to
joab
saying
send
me
uriah
the
hittite
and
joab
sent
uriah
to
david
and
when
uriah
was
come
unto
him
david
demanded
of
him
how
joab
did
and
how
the
people
did
and
how
the
war
prospered
and
david
said
to
uriah
go
down
to
thy
house
and
wash
thy
feet
and
uriah
departed
out
of
the
king's
house
and
there
followed
him
a
mess
of
meat
from
the
king
but
uriah
slept
at
the
door
of
the
king's
house
with
all
the
servants
of
his
lord
and
went
not
down
to
his
house
and
when
they
had
told
david
saying
uriah
went
not
down
unto
his
house
david
said
unto
uriah
camest
thou
not
from
thy
journey
why
then
didst
thou
not
go
down
unto
thine
house
and
uriah
said
unto
david
the
ark
and
israel
and
judah
abide
in
tents
and
my
lord
joab
and
the
servants
of
my
lord
are
encamped
in
the
open
fields
shall
i
then
go
into
mine
house
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
lie
with
my
wife
as
thou
livest
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
do
this
thing
and
david
said
to
uriah
tarry
here
to
day
also
and
to
morrow
i
will
let
thee
depart
so
uriah
abode
in
jerusalem
that
day
and
the
morrow
and
when
david
had
called
him
he
did
eat
and
drink
before
him
and
he
made
him
drunk
and
at
even
he
went
out
to
lie
on
his
bed
with
the
servants
of
his
lord
but
went
not
down
to
his
house
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
david
wrote
a
letter
to
joab
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
uriah
and
he
wrote
in
the
letter
saying
set
ye
uriah
in
the
forefront
of
the
hottest
battle
and
retire
ye
from
him
that
he
may
be
smitten
and
die
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joab
observed
the
city
that
he
assigned
uriah
unto
a
place
where
he
knew
that
valiant
men
were
and
the
men
of
the
city
went
out
and
fought
with
joab
and
there
fell
some
of
the
people
of
the
servants
of
david
and
uriah
the
hittite
died
also
then
joab
sent
and
told
david
all
the
things
concerning
the
war
and
charged
the
messenger
saying
when
thou
hast
made
an
end
of
telling
the
matters
of
the
war
unto
the
king
and
if
so
be
that
the
king's
wrath
arise
and
he
say
unto
thee
wherefore
approached
ye
so
nigh
unto
the
city
when
ye
did
fight
knew
ye
not
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
wall
who
smote
abimelech
the
son
of
jerubbesheth
did
not
a
woman
cast
a
piece
of
a
millstone
upon
him
from
the
wall
that
he
died
in
thebez
why
went
ye
nigh
the
wall
then
say
thou
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
also
so
the
messenger
went
and
came
and
shewed
david
all
that
joab
had
sent
him
for
and
the
messenger
said
unto
david
surely
the
men
prevailed
against
us
and
came
out
unto
us
into
the
field
and
we
were
upon
them
even
unto
the
entering
of
the
gate
and
the
shooters
shot
from
off
the
wall
upon
thy
servants
and
some
of
the
king's
servants
be
dead
and
thy
servant
uriah
the
hittite
is
dead
also
then
david
said
unto
the
messenger
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
joab
let
not
this
thing
displease
thee
for
the
sword
devoureth
one
as
well
as
another
make
thy
battle
more
strong
against
the
city
and
overthrow
it
and
encourage
thou
him
and
when
the
wife
of
uriah
heard
that
uriah
her
husband
was
dead
she
mourned
for
her
husband
and
when
the
mourning
was
past
david
sent
and
fetched
her
to
his
house
and
she
became
his
wife
and
bare
him
a
son
but
the
thing
that
david
had
done
displeased
the
lord
and
the
lord
sent
nathan
unto
david
and
he
came
unto
him
and
said
unto
him
there
were
two
men
in
one
city
the
one
rich
and
the
other
poor
the
rich
man
had
exceeding
many
flocks
and
herds
but
the
poor
man
had
nothing
save
one
little
ewe
lamb
which
he
had
bought
and
nourished
up
and
it
grew
up
together
with
him
and
with
his
children
it
did
eat
of
his
own
meat
and
drank
of
his
own
cup
and
lay
in
his
bosom
and
was
unto
him
as
a
daughter
and
there
came
a
traveller
unto
the
rich
man
and
he
spared
to
take
of
his
own
flock
and
of
his
own
herd
to
dress
for
the
wayfaring
man
that
was
come
unto
him
but
took
the
poor
man's
lamb
and
dressed
it
for
the
man
that
was
come
to
him
and
david's
anger
was
greatly
kindled
against
the
man
and
he
said
to
nathan
as
the
lord
liveth
the
man
that
hath
done
this
thing
shall
surely
die
and
he
shall
restore
the
lamb
fourfold
because
he
did
this
thing
and
because
he
had
no
pity
and
nathan
said
to
david
thou
art
the
man
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
and
i
delivered
thee
out
of
the
hand
of
saul
and
i
gave
thee
thy
master's
house
and
thy
master's
wives
into
thy
bosom
and
gave
thee
the
house
of
israel
and
of
judah
and
if
that
had
been
too
little
i
would
moreover
have
given
unto
thee
such
and
such
things
wherefore
hast
thou
despised
the
commandment
of
the
lord
to
do
evil
in
his
sight
thou
hast
killed
uriah
the
hittite
with
the
sword
and
hast
taken
his
wife
to
be
thy
wife
and
hast
slain
him
with
the
sword
of
the
children
of
ammon
now
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thine
house
because
thou
hast
despised
me
and
hast
taken
the
wife
of
uriah
the
hittite
to
be
thy
wife
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
raise
up
evil
against
thee
out
of
thine
own
house
and
i
will
take
thy
wives
before
thine
eyes
and
give
them
unto
thy
neighbour
and
he
shall
lie
with
thy
wives
in
the
sight
of
this
sun
for
thou
didst
it
secretly
but
i
will
do
this
thing
before
all
israel
and
before
the
sun
and
david
said
unto
nathan
i
have
sinned
against
the
lord
and
nathan
said
unto
david
the
lord
also
hath
put
away
thy
sin
thou
shalt
not
die
howbeit
because
by
this
deed
thou
hast
given
great
occasion
to
the
enemies
of
the
lord
to
blaspheme
the
child
also
that
is
born
unto
thee
shall
surely
die
and
nathan
departed
unto
his
house
and
the
lord
struck
the
child
that
uriah's
wife
bare
unto
david
and
it
was
very
sick
david
therefore
besought
god
for
the
child
and
david
fasted
and
went
in
and
lay
all
night
upon
the
earth
and
the
elders
of
his
house
arose
and
went
to
him
to
raise
him
up
from
the
earth
but
he
would
not
neither
did
he
eat
bread
with
them
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
seventh
day
that
the
child
died
and
the
servants
of
david
feared
to
tell
him
that
the
child
was
dead
for
they
said
behold
while
the
child
was
yet
alive
we
spake
unto
him
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
our
voice
how
will
he
then
vex
himself
if
we
tell
him
that
the
child
is
dead
but
when
david
saw
that
his
servants
whispered
david
perceived
that
the
child
was
dead
therefore
david
said
unto
his
servants
is
the
child
dead
and
they
said
he
is
dead
then
david
arose
from
the
earth
and
washed
and
anointed
himself
and
changed
his
apparel
and
came
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
worshipped
then
he
came
to
his
own
house
and
when
he
required
they
set
bread
before
him
and
he
did
eat
then
said
his
servants
unto
him
what
thing
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
thou
didst
fast
and
weep
for
the
child
while
it
was
alive
but
when
the
child
was
dead
thou
didst
rise
and
eat
bread
and
he
said
while
the
child
was
yet
alive
i
fasted
and
wept
for
i
said
who
can
tell
whether
god
will
be
gracious
to
me
that
the
child
may
live
but
now
he
is
dead
wherefore
should
i
fast
can
i
bring
him
back
again
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me
and
david
comforted
bathsheba
his
wife
and
went
in
unto
her
and
lay
with
her
and
she
bare
a
son
and
he
called
his
name
solomon
and
the
lord
loved
him
and
he
sent
by
the
hand
of
nathan
the
prophet
and
he
called
his
name
jedidiah
because
of
the
lord
and
joab
fought
against
rabbah
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
took
the
royal
city
and
joab
sent
messengers
to
david
and
said
i
have
fought
against
rabbah
and
have
taken
the
city
of
waters
now
therefore
gather
the
rest
of
the
people
together
and
encamp
against
the
city
and
take
it
lest
i
take
the
city
and
it
be
called
after
my
name
and
david
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
went
to
rabbah
and
fought
against
it
and
took
it
and
he
took
their
king's
crown
from
off
his
head
the
weight
whereof
was
a
talent
of
gold
with
the
precious
stones
and
it
was
set
on
david's
head
and
he
brought
forth
the
spoil
of
the
city
in
great
abundance
and
he
brought
forth
the
people
that
were
therein
and
put
them
under
saws
and
under
harrows
of
iron
and
under
axes
of
iron
and
made
them
pass
through
the
brick-kiln
and
thus
did
he
unto
all
the
cities
of
the
children
of
ammon
so
david
and
all
the
people
returned
unto
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
absalom
the
son
of
david
had
a
fair
sister
whose
name
was
tamar
and
amnon
the
son
of
david
loved
her
and
amnon
was
so
vexed
that
he
fell
sick
for
his
sister
tamar
for
she
was
a
virgin
and
amnon
thought
it
hard
for
him
to
do
anything
to
her
but
amnon
had
a
friend
whose
name
was
jonadab
the
son
of
shimeah
david's
brother
and
jonadab
was
a
very
subtil
man
and
he
said
unto
him
why
art
thou
being
the
king's
son
lean
from
day
to
day
wilt
thou
not
tell
me
and
amnon
said
unto
him
i
love
tamar
my
brother
absalom's
sister
and
jonadab
said
unto
him
lay
thee
down
on
thy
bed
and
make
thyself
sick
and
when
thy
father
cometh
to
see
thee
say
unto
him
i
pray
thee
let
my
sister
tamar
come
and
give
me
meat
and
dress
the
meat
in
my
sight
that
i
may
see
it
and
eat
it
at
her
hand
so
amnon
lay
down
and
made
himself
sick
and
when
the
king
was
come
to
see
him
amnon
said
unto
the
king
i
pray
thee
let
tamar
my
sister
come
and
make
me
a
couple
of
cakes
in
my
sight
that
i
may
eat
at
her
hand
then
david
sent
home
to
tamar
saying
go
now
to
thy
brother
amnon's
house
and
dress
him
meat
so
tamar
went
to
her
brother
amnon's
house
and
he
was
laid
down
and
she
took
flour
and
kneaded
it
and
made
cakes
in
his
sight
and
did
bake
the
cakes
and
she
took
a
pan
and
poured
them
out
before
him
but
he
refused
to
eat
and
amnon
said
have
out
all
men
from
me
and
they
went
out
every
man
from
him
and
amnon
said
unto
tamar
bring
the
meat
into
the
chamber
that
i
may
eat
of
thine
hand
and
tamar
took
the
cakes
which
she
had
made
and
brought
them
into
the
chamber
to
amnon
her
brother
and
when
she
had
brought
them
unto
him
to
eat
he
took
hold
of
her
and
said
unto
her
come
lie
with
me
my
sister
and
she
answered
him
nay
my
brother
do
not
force
me
for
no
such
thing
ought
to
be
done
in
israel
do
not
thou
this
folly
and
i
whither
shall
i
cause
my
shame
to
go
and
as
for
thee
thou
shalt
be
as
one
of
the
fools
in
israel
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
speak
unto
the
king
for
he
will
not
withhold
me
from
thee
howbeit
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
voice
but
being
stronger
than
she
forced
her
and
lay
with
her
then
amnon
hated
her
exceedingly
so
that
the
hatred
wherewith
he
hated
her
was
greater
than
the
love
wherewith
he
had
loved
her
and
amnon
said
unto
her
arise
be
gone
and
she
said
unto
him
there
is
no
cause
this
evil
in
sending
me
away
is
greater
than
the
other
that
thou
didst
unto
me
but
he
would
not
hearken
unto
her
then
he
called
his
servant
that
ministered
unto
him
and
said
put
now
this
woman
out
from
me
and
bolt
the
door
after
her
and
she
had
a
garment
of
divers
colours
upon
her
for
with
such
robes
were
the
king's
daughters
that
were
virgins
apparelled
then
his
servant
brought
her
out
and
bolted
the
door
after
her
and
tamar
put
ashes
on
her
head
and
rent
her
garment
of
divers
colours
that
was
on
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
head
and
went
on
crying
and
absalom
her
brother
said
unto
her
hath
amnon
thy
brother
been
with
thee
but
hold
now
thy
peace
my
sister
he
is
thy
brother
regard
not
this
thing
so
tamar
remained
desolate
in
her
brother
absalom's
house
but
when
king
david
heard
of
all
these
things
he
was
very
wroth
and
absalom
spake
unto
his
brother
amnon
neither
good
nor
bad
for
absalom
hated
amnon
because
he
had
forced
his
sister
tamar
and
it
came
to
pass
after
two
full
years
that
absalom
had
sheepshearers
in
baalhazor
which
is
beside
ephraim
and
absalom
invited
all
the
king's
sons
and
absalom
came
to
the
king
and
said
behold
now
thy
servant
hath
sheepshearers
let
the
king
i
beseech
thee
and
his
servants
go
with
thy
servant
and
the
king
said
to
absalom
nay
my
son
let
us
not
all
now
go
lest
we
be
chargeable
unto
thee
and
he
pressed
him
howbeit
he
would
not
go
but
blessed
him
then
said
absalom
if
not
i
pray
thee
let
my
brother
amnon
go
with
us
and
the
king
said
unto
him
why
should
he
go
with
thee
but
absalom
pressed
him
that
he
let
amnon
and
all
the
king's
sons
go
with
him
now
absalom
had
commanded
his
servants
saying
mark
ye
now
when
amnon's
heart
is
merry
with
wine
and
when
i
say
unto
you
smite
amnon
then
kill
him
fear
not
have
not
i
commanded
you
be
courageous
and
be
valiant
and
the
servants
of
absalom
did
unto
amnon
as
absalom
had
commanded
then
all
the
king's
sons
arose
and
every
man
gat
him
up
upon
his
mule
and
fled
and
it
came
to
pass
while
they
were
in
the
way
that
tidings
came
to
david
saying
absalom
hath
slain
all
the
king's
sons
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
left
then
the
king
arose
and
tare
his
garments
and
lay
on
the
earth
and
all
his
servants
stood
by
with
their
clothes
rent
and
jonadab
the
son
of
shimeah
david's
brother
answered
and
said
let
not
my
lord
suppose
that
they
have
slain
all
the
young
men
the
king's
sons
for
amnon
only
is
dead
for
by
the
appointment
of
absalom
this
hath
been
determined
from
the
day
that
he
forced
his
sister
tamar
now
therefore
let
not
my
lord
the
king
take
the
thing
to
his
heart
to
think
that
all
the
king's
sons
are
dead
for
amnon
only
is
dead
but
absalom
fled
and
the
young
man
that
kept
the
watch
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
there
came
much
people
by
the
way
of
the
hill
side
behind
him
and
jonadab
said
unto
the
king
behold
the
king's
sons
come
as
thy
servant
said
so
it
is
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
that
behold
the
king's
sons
came
and
lifted
up
their
voice
and
wept
and
the
king
also
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
sore
but
absalom
fled
and
went
to
talmai
the
son
of
ammihud
king
of
geshur
and
david
mourned
for
his
son
every
day
so
absalom
fled
and
went
to
geshur
and
was
there
three
years
and
the
soul
of
king
david
longed
to
go
forth
unto
absalom
for
he
was
comforted
concerning
amnon
seeing
he
was
dead
now
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
perceived
that
the
king's
heart
was
toward
absalom
and
joab
sent
to
tekoah
and
fetched
thence
a
wise
woman
and
said
unto
her
i
pray
thee
feign
thyself
to
be
a
mourner
and
put
on
now
mourning
apparel
and
anoint
not
thyself
with
oil
but
be
as
a
woman
that
had
a
long
time
mourned
for
the
dead
and
come
to
the
king
and
speak
on
this
manner
unto
him
so
joab
put
the
words
in
her
mouth
and
when
the
woman
of
tekoah
spake
to
the
king
she
fell
on
her
face
to
the
ground
and
did
obeisance
and
said
help
o
king
and
the
king
said
unto
her
what
aileth
thee
and
she
answered
i
am
indeed
a
widow
woman
and
mine
husband
is
dead
and
thy
handmaid
had
two
sons
and
they
two
strove
together
in
the
field
and
there
was
none
to
part
them
but
the
one
smote
the
other
and
slew
him
and
behold
the
whole
family
is
risen
against
thine
handmaid
and
they
said
deliver
him
that
smote
his
brother
that
we
may
kill
him
for
the
life
of
his
brother
whom
he
slew
and
we
will
destroy
the
heir
also
and
so
they
shall
quench
my
coal
which
is
left
and
shall
not
leave
to
my
husband
neither
name
nor
remainder
upon
the
earth
and
the
king
said
unto
the
woman
go
to
thine
house
and
i
will
give
charge
concerning
thee
and
the
woman
of
tekoah
said
unto
the
king
my
lord
o
king
the
iniquity
be
on
me
and
on
my
father's
house
and
the
king
and
his
throne
be
guiltless
and
the
king
said
whoever
saith
ought
unto
thee
bring
him
to
me
and
he
shall
not
touch
thee
any
more
then
said
she
i
pray
thee
let
the
king
remember
the
lord
thy
god
that
thou
wouldest
not
suffer
the
revengers
of
blood
to
destroy
any
more
lest
they
destroy
my
son
and
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
there
shall
not
one
hair
of
thy
son
fall
to
the
earth
then
the
woman
said
let
thine
handmaid
i
pray
thee
speak
one
word
unto
my
lord
the
king
and
he
said
say
on
and
the
woman
said
wherefore
then
hast
thou
thought
such
a
thing
against
the
people
of
god
for
the
king
doth
speak
this
thing
as
one
which
is
faulty
in
that
the
king
doth
not
fetch
home
again
his
banished
for
we
must
needs
die
and
are
as
water
spilt
on
the
ground
which
cannot
be
gathered
up
again
neither
doth
god
respect
any
person
yet
doth
he
devise
means
that
his
banished
be
not
expelled
from
him
now
therefore
that
i
am
come
to
speak
of
this
thing
unto
my
lord
the
king
it
is
because
the
people
have
made
me
afraid
and
thy
handmaid
said
i
will
now
speak
unto
the
king
it
may
be
that
the
king
will
perform
the
request
of
his
handmaid
for
the
king
will
hear
to
deliver
his
handmaid
out
of
the
hand
of
the
man
that
would
destroy
me
and
my
son
together
out
of
the
inheritance
of
god
then
thine
handmaid
said
the
word
of
my
lord
the
king
shall
now
be
comfortable
for
as
an
angel
of
god
so
is
my
lord
the
king
to
discern
good
and
bad
therefore
the
lord
thy
god
will
be
with
thee
then
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
woman
hide
not
from
me
i
pray
thee
the
thing
that
i
shall
ask
thee
and
the
woman
said
let
my
lord
the
king
now
speak
and
the
king
said
is
not
the
hand
of
joab
with
thee
in
all
this
and
the
woman
answered
and
said
as
thy
soul
liveth
my
lord
the
king
none
can
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
from
ought
that
my
lord
the
king
hath
spoken
for
thy
servant
joab
he
bade
me
and
he
put
all
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
thine
handmaid
to
fetch
about
this
form
of
speech
hath
thy
servant
joab
done
this
thing
and
my
lord
is
wise
according
to
the
wisdom
of
an
angel
of
god
to
know
all
things
that
are
in
the
earth
and
the
king
said
unto
joab
behold
now
i
have
done
this
thing
go
therefore
bring
the
young
man
absalom
again
and
joab
fell
to
the
ground
on
his
face
and
bowed
himself
and
thanked
the
king
and
joab
said
to
day
thy
servant
knoweth
that
i
have
found
grace
in
thy
sight
my
lord
o
king
in
that
the
king
hath
fulfilled
the
request
of
his
servant
so
joab
arose
and
went
to
geshur
and
brought
absalom
to
jerusalem
and
the
king
said
let
him
turn
to
his
own
house
and
let
him
not
see
my
face
so
absalom
returned
to
his
own
house
and
saw
not
the
king's
face
but
in
all
israel
there
was
none
to
be
so
much
praised
as
absalom
for
his
beauty
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
even
to
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
no
blemish
in
him
and
when
he
polled
his
head
for
it
was
at
every
year's
end
that
he
polled
it
because
the
hair
was
heavy
on
him
therefore
he
polled
it
he
weighed
the
hair
of
his
head
at
two
hundred
shekels
after
the
king's
weight
and
unto
absalom
there
were
born
three
sons
and
one
daughter
whose
name
was
tamar
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fair
countenance
so
absalom
dwelt
two
full
years
in
jerusalem
and
saw
not
the
king's
face
therefore
absalom
sent
for
joab
to
have
sent
him
to
the
king
but
he
would
not
come
to
him
and
when
he
sent
again
the
second
time
he
would
not
come
therefore
he
said
unto
his
servants
see
joab's
field
is
near
mine
and
he
hath
barley
there
go
and
set
it
on
fire
and
absalom's
servants
set
the
field
on
fire
then
joab
arose
and
came
to
absalom
unto
his
house
and
said
unto
him
wherefore
have
thy
servants
set
my
field
on
fire
and
absalom
answered
joab
behold
i
sent
unto
thee
saying
come
hither
that
i
may
send
thee
to
the
king
to
say
wherefore
am
i
come
from
geshur
it
had
been
good
for
me
to
have
been
there
still
now
therefore
let
me
see
the
king's
face
and
if
there
be
any
iniquity
in
me
let
him
kill
me
so
joab
came
to
the
king
and
told
him
and
when
he
had
called
for
absalom
he
came
to
the
king
and
bowed
himself
on
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
king
and
the
king
kissed
absalom
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
absalom
prepared
him
chariots
and
horses
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him
and
absalom
rose
up
early
and
stood
beside
the
way
of
the
gate
and
it
was
so
that
when
any
man
that
had
a
controversy
came
to
the
king
for
judgment
then
absalom
called
unto
him
and
said
of
what
city
art
thou
and
he
said
thy
servant
is
of
one
of
the
tribes
of
israel
and
absalom
said
unto
him
see
thy
matters
are
good
and
right
but
there
is
no
man
deputed
of
the
king
to
hear
thee
absalom
said
moreover
oh
that
i
were
made
judge
in
the
land
that
every
man
which
hath
any
suit
or
cause
might
come
unto
me
and
i
would
do
him
justice
and
it
was
so
that
when
any
man
came
nigh
to
him
to
do
him
obeisance
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
took
him
and
kissed
him
and
on
this
manner
did
absalom
to
all
israel
that
came
to
the
king
for
judgment
so
absalom
stole
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
after
forty
years
that
absalom
said
unto
the
king
i
pray
thee
let
me
go
and
pay
my
vow
which
i
have
vowed
unto
the
lord
in
hebron
for
thy
servant
vowed
a
vow
while
i
abode
at
geshur
in
syria
saying
if
the
lord
shall
bring
me
again
indeed
to
jerusalem
then
i
will
serve
the
lord
and
the
king
said
unto
him
go
in
peace
so
he
arose
and
went
to
hebron
but
absalom
sent
spies
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
saying
as
soon
as
ye
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
then
ye
shall
say
absalom
reigneth
in
hebron
and
with
absalom
went
two
hundred
men
out
of
jerusalem
that
were
called
and
they
went
in
their
simplicity
and
they
knew
not
any
thing
and
absalom
sent
for
ahithophel
the
gilonite
david's
counsellor
from
his
city
even
from
giloh
while
he
offered
sacrifices
and
the
conspiracy
was
strong
for
the
people
increased
continually
with
absalom
and
there
came
a
messenger
to
david
saying
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
israel
are
after
absalom
and
david
said
unto
all
his
servants
that
were
with
him
at
jerusalem
arise
and
let
us
flee
for
we
shall
not
else
escape
from
absalom
make
speed
to
depart
lest
he
overtake
us
suddenly
and
bring
evil
upon
us
and
smite
the
city
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
king's
servants
said
unto
the
king
behold
thy
servants
are
ready
to
do
whatsoever
my
lord
the
king
shall
appoint
and
the
king
went
forth
and
all
his
household
after
him
and
the
king
left
ten
women
which
were
concubines
to
keep
the
house
and
the
king
went
forth
and
all
the
people
after
him
and
tarried
in
a
place
that
was
far
off
and
all
his
servants
passed
on
beside
him
and
all
the
cherethites
and
all
the
pelethites
and
all
the
gittites
six
hundred
men
which
came
after
him
from
gath
passed
on
before
the
king
then
said
the
king
to
ittai
the
gittite
wherefore
goest
thou
also
with
us
return
to
thy
place
and
abide
with
the
king
for
thou
art
a
stranger
and
also
an
exile
whereas
thou
camest
but
yesterday
should
i
this
day
make
thee
go
up
and
down
with
us
seeing
i
go
whither
i
may
return
thou
and
take
back
thy
brethren
mercy
and
truth
be
with
thee
and
ittai
answered
the
king
and
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
my
lord
the
king
liveth
surely
in
what
place
my
lord
the
king
shall
be
whether
in
death
or
life
even
there
also
will
thy
servant
be
and
david
said
to
ittai
go
and
pass
over
and
ittai
the
gittite
passed
over
and
all
his
men
and
all
the
little
ones
that
were
with
him
and
all
the
country
wept
with
a
loud
voice
and
all
the
people
passed
over
the
king
also
himself
passed
over
the
brook
kidron
and
all
the
people
passed
over
toward
the
way
of
the
wilderness
and
lo
zadok
also
and
all
the
levites
were
with
him
bearing
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
god
and
they
set
down
the
ark
of
god
and
abiathar
went
up
until
all
the
people
had
done
passing
out
of
the
city
and
the
king
said
unto
zadok
carry
back
the
ark
of
god
into
the
city
if
i
shall
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
he
will
bring
me
again
and
shew
me
both
it
and
his
habitation
but
if
he
thus
say
i
have
no
delight
in
thee
behold
here
am
i
let
him
do
to
me
as
seemeth
good
unto
him
the
king
said
also
unto
zadok
the
priest
art
not
thou
a
seer
return
into
the
city
in
peace
and
your
two
sons
with
you
ahimaaz
thy
son
and
jonathan
the
son
of
abiathar
see
i
will
tarry
in
the
plain
of
the
wilderness
until
there
come
word
from
you
to
certify
me
zadok
therefore
and
abiathar
carried
the
ark
of
god
again
to
jerusalem
and
they
tarried
there
and
david
went
up
by
the
ascent
of
mount
olivet
and
wept
as
he
went
up
and
had
his
head
covered
and
he
went
barefoot
and
all
the
people
that
was
with
him
covered
every
man
his
head
and
they
went
up
weeping
as
they
went
up
and
one
told
david
saying
ahithophel
is
among
the
conspirators
with
absalom
and
david
said
o
lord
i
pray
thee
turn
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
into
foolishness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
david
was
come
to
the
top
of
the
mount
where
he
worshipped
god
behold
hushai
the
archite
came
to
meet
him
with
his
coat
rent
and
earth
upon
his
head
unto
whom
david
said
if
thou
passest
on
with
me
then
thou
shalt
be
a
burden
unto
me
but
if
thou
return
to
the
city
and
say
unto
absalom
i
will
be
thy
servant
o
king
as
i
have
been
thy
father's
servant
hitherto
so
will
i
now
also
be
thy
servant
then
mayest
thou
for
me
defeat
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
and
hast
thou
not
there
with
thee
zadok
and
abiathar
the
priests
therefore
it
shall
be
that
what
thing
soever
thou
shalt
hear
out
of
the
king's
house
thou
shalt
tell
it
to
zadok
and
abiathar
the
priests
behold
they
have
there
with
them
their
two
sons
ahimaaz
zadok's
son
and
jonathan
abiathar's
son
and
by
them
ye
shall
send
unto
me
every
thing
that
ye
can
hear
so
hushai
david's
friend
came
into
the
city
and
absalom
came
into
jerusalem
and
when
david
was
a
little
past
the
top
of
the
hill
behold
ziba
the
servant
of
mephibosheth
met
him
with
a
couple
of
asses
saddled
and
upon
them
two
hundred
loaves
of
bread
and
an
hundred
bunches
of
raisins
and
an
hundred
of
summer
fruits
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
the
king
said
unto
ziba
what
meanest
thou
by
these
and
ziba
said
the
asses
be
for
the
king's
household
to
ride
on
and
the
bread
and
summer
fruit
for
the
young
men
to
eat
and
the
wine
that
such
as
be
faint
in
the
wilderness
may
drink
and
the
king
said
and
where
is
thy
master's
son
and
ziba
said
unto
the
king
behold
he
abideth
at
jerusalem
for
he
said
to
day
shall
the
house
of
israel
restore
me
the
kingdom
of
my
father
then
said
the
king
to
ziba
behold
thine
are
all
that
pertained
unto
mephibosheth
and
ziba
said
i
humbly
beseech
thee
that
i
may
find
grace
in
thy
sight
my
lord
o
king
and
when
king
david
came
to
bahurim
behold
thence
came
out
a
man
of
the
family
of
the
house
of
saul
whose
name
was
shimei
the
son
of
gera
he
came
forth
and
cursed
still
as
he
came
and
he
cast
stones
at
david
and
at
all
the
servants
of
king
david
and
all
the
people
and
all
the
mighty
men
were
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
thus
said
shimei
when
he
cursed
come
out
come
out
thou
bloody
man
and
thou
man
of
belial
the
lord
hath
returned
upon
thee
all
the
blood
of
the
house
of
saul
in
whose
stead
thou
hast
reigned
and
the
lord
hath
delivered
the
kingdom
into
the
hand
of
absalom
thy
son
and
behold
thou
art
taken
in
thy
mischief
because
thou
art
a
bloody
man
then
said
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
unto
the
king
why
should
this
dead
dog
curse
my
lord
the
king
let
me
go
over
i
pray
thee
and
take
off
his
head
and
the
king
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
ye
sons
of
zeruiah
so
let
him
curse
because
the
lord
hath
said
unto
him
curse
david
who
shall
then
say
wherefore
hast
thou
done
so
and
david
said
to
abishai
and
to
all
his
servants
behold
my
son
which
came
forth
of
my
bowels
seeketh
my
life
how
much
more
now
may
this
benjamite
do
it
let
him
alone
and
let
him
curse
for
the
lord
hath
bidden
him
it
may
be
that
the
lord
will
look
on
mine
affliction
and
that
the
lord
will
requite
me
good
for
his
cursing
this
day
and
as
david
and
his
men
went
by
the
way
shimei
went
along
on
the
hill's
side
over
against
him
and
cursed
as
he
went
and
threw
stones
at
him
and
cast
dust
and
the
king
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
came
weary
and
refreshed
themselves
there
and
absalom
and
all
the
people
the
men
of
israel
came
to
jerusalem
and
ahithophel
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
when
hushai
the
archite
david's
friend
was
come
unto
absalom
that
hushai
said
unto
absalom
god
save
the
king
god
save
the
king
and
absalom
said
to
hushai
is
this
thy
kindness
to
thy
friend
why
wentest
thou
not
with
thy
friend
and
hushai
said
unto
absalom
nay
but
whom
the
lord
and
this
people
and
all
the
men
of
israel
choose
his
will
i
be
and
with
him
will
i
abide
and
again
whom
should
i
serve
should
i
not
serve
in
the
presence
of
his
son
as
i
have
served
in
thy
father's
presence
so
will
i
be
in
thy
presence
then
said
absalom
to
ahithophel
give
counsel
among
you
what
we
shall
do
and
ahithophel
said
unto
absalom
go
in
unto
thy
father's
concubines
which
he
hath
left
to
keep
the
house
and
all
israel
shall
hear
that
thou
art
abhorred
of
thy
father
then
shall
the
hands
of
all
that
are
with
thee
be
strong
so
they
spread
absalom
a
tent
upon
the
top
of
the
house
and
absalom
went
in
unto
his
father's
concubines
in
the
sight
of
all
israel
and
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
which
he
counselled
in
those
days
was
as
if
a
man
had
enquired
at
the
oracle
of
god
so
was
all
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
both
with
david
and
with
absalom
moreover
ahithophel
said
unto
absalom
let
me
now
choose
out
twelve
thousand
men
and
i
will
arise
and
pursue
after
david
this
night
and
i
will
come
upon
him
while
he
is
weary
and
weak
handed
and
will
make
him
afraid
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
shall
flee
and
i
will
smite
the
king
only
and
i
will
bring
back
all
the
people
unto
thee
the
man
whom
thou
seekest
is
as
if
all
returned
so
all
the
people
shall
be
in
peace
and
the
saying
pleased
absalom
well
and
all
the
elders
of
israel
then
said
absalom
call
now
hushai
the
archite
also
and
let
us
hear
likewise
what
he
saith
and
when
hushai
was
come
to
absalom
absalom
spake
unto
him
saying
ahithophel
hath
spoken
after
this
manner
shall
we
do
after
his
saying
if
not
speak
thou
and
hushai
said
unto
absalom
the
counsel
that
ahithophel
hath
given
is
not
good
at
this
time
for
said
hushai
thou
knowest
thy
father
and
his
men
that
they
be
mighty
men
and
they
be
chafed
in
their
minds
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
in
the
field
and
thy
father
is
a
man
of
war
and
will
not
lodge
with
the
people
behold
he
is
hid
now
in
some
pit
or
in
some
other
place
and
it
will
come
to
pass
when
some
of
them
be
overthrown
at
the
first
that
whosoever
heareth
it
will
say
there
is
a
slaughter
among
the
people
that
follow
absalom
and
he
also
that
is
valiant
whose
heart
is
as
the
heart
of
a
lion
shall
utterly
melt
for
all
israel
knoweth
that
thy
father
is
a
mighty
man
and
they
which
be
with
him
are
valiant
men
therefore
i
counsel
that
all
israel
be
generally
gathered
unto
thee
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
as
the
sand
that
is
by
the
sea
for
multitude
and
that
thou
go
to
battle
in
thine
own
person
so
shall
we
come
upon
him
in
some
place
where
he
shall
be
found
and
we
will
light
upon
him
as
the
dew
falleth
on
the
ground
and
of
him
and
of
all
the
men
that
are
with
him
there
shall
not
be
left
so
much
as
one
moreover
if
he
be
gotten
into
a
city
then
shall
all
israel
bring
ropes
to
that
city
and
we
will
draw
it
into
the
river
until
there
be
not
one
small
stone
found
there
and
absalom
and
all
the
men
of
israel
said
the
counsel
of
hushai
the
archite
is
better
than
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
for
the
lord
had
appointed
to
defeat
the
good
counsel
of
ahithophel
to
the
intent
that
the
lord
might
bring
evil
upon
absalom
then
said
hushai
unto
zadok
and
to
abiathar
the
priests
thus
and
thus
did
ahithophel
counsel
absalom
and
the
elders
of
israel
and
thus
and
thus
have
i
counselled
now
therefore
send
quickly
and
tell
david
saying
lodge
not
this
night
in
the
plains
of
the
wilderness
but
speedily
pass
over
lest
the
king
be
swallowed
up
and
all
the
people
that
are
with
him
now
jonathan
and
ahimaaz
stayed
by
enrogel
for
they
might
not
be
seen
to
come
into
the
city
and
a
wench
went
and
told
them
and
they
went
and
told
king
david
nevertheless
a
lad
saw
them
and
told
absalom
but
they
went
both
of
them
away
quickly
and
came
to
a
man's
house
in
bahurim
which
had
a
well
in
his
court
whither
they
went
down
and
the
woman
took
and
spread
a
covering
over
the
well's
mouth
and
spread
ground
corn
thereon
and
the
thing
was
not
known
and
when
absalom's
servants
came
to
the
woman
to
the
house
they
said
where
is
ahimaaz
and
jonathan
and
the
woman
said
unto
them
they
be
gone
over
the
brook
of
water
and
when
they
had
sought
and
could
not
find
them
they
returned
to
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
were
departed
that
they
came
up
out
of
the
well
and
went
and
told
king
david
and
said
unto
david
arise
and
pass
quickly
over
the
water
for
thus
hath
ahithophel
counselled
against
you
then
david
arose
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
they
passed
over
jordan
by
the
morning
light
there
lacked
not
one
of
them
that
was
not
gone
over
jordan
and
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
counsel
was
not
followed
he
saddled
his
ass
and
arose
and
gat
him
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
and
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
was
buried
in
the
sepulchre
of
his
father
then
david
came
to
mahanaim
and
absalom
passed
over
jordan
he
and
all
the
men
of
israel
with
him
and
absalom
made
amasa
captain
of
the
host
instead
of
joab
which
amasa
was
a
man's
son
whose
name
was
ithra
an
israelite
that
went
in
to
abigail
the
daughter
of
nahash
sister
to
zeruiah
joab's
mother
so
israel
and
absalom
pitched
in
the
land
of
gilead
and
it
came
to
pass
when
david
was
come
to
mahanaim
that
shobi
the
son
of
nahash
of
rabbah
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
machir
the
son
of
ammiel
of
lodebar
and
barzillai
the
gileadite
of
rogelim
brought
beds
and
basons
and
earthen
vessels
and
wheat
and
barley
and
flour
and
parched
corn
and
beans
and
lentiles
and
parched
pulse
and
honey
and
butter
and
sheep
and
cheese
of
kine
for
david
and
for
the
people
that
were
with
him
to
eat
for
they
said
the
people
is
hungry
and
weary
and
thirsty
in
the
wilderness
and
david
numbered
the
people
that
were
with
him
and
set
captains
of
thousands
and
captains
of
hundreds
over
them
and
david
sent
forth
a
third
part
of
the
people
under
the
hand
of
joab
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
joab's
brother
and
a
third
part
under
the
hand
of
ittai
the
gittite
and
the
king
said
unto
the
people
i
will
surely
go
forth
with
you
myself
also
but
the
people
answered
thou
shalt
not
go
forth
for
if
we
flee
away
they
will
not
care
for
us
neither
if
half
of
us
die
will
they
care
for
us
but
now
thou
art
worth
ten
thousand
of
us
therefore
now
it
is
better
that
thou
succour
us
out
of
the
city
and
the
king
said
unto
them
what
seemeth
you
best
i
will
do
and
the
king
stood
by
the
gate
side
and
all
the
people
came
out
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
and
the
king
commanded
joab
and
abishai
and
ittai
saying
deal
gently
for
my
sake
with
the
young
man
even
with
absalom
and
all
the
people
heard
when
the
king
gave
all
the
captains
charge
concerning
absalom
so
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
against
israel
and
the
battle
was
in
the
wood
of
ephraim
where
the
people
of
israel
were
slain
before
the
servants
of
david
and
there
was
there
a
great
slaughter
that
day
of
twenty
thousand
men
for
the
battle
was
there
scattered
over
the
face
of
all
the
country
and
the
wood
devoured
more
people
that
day
than
the
sword
devoured
and
absalom
met
the
servants
of
david
and
absalom
rode
upon
a
mule
and
the
mule
went
under
the
thick
boughs
of
a
great
oak
and
his
head
caught
hold
of
the
oak
and
he
was
taken
up
between
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
mule
that
was
under
him
went
away
and
a
certain
man
saw
it
and
told
joab
and
said
behold
i
saw
absalom
hanged
in
an
oak
and
joab
said
unto
the
man
that
told
him
and
behold
thou
sawest
him
and
why
didst
thou
not
smite
him
there
to
the
ground
and
i
would
have
given
thee
ten
shekels
of
silver
and
a
girdle
and
the
man
said
unto
joab
though
i
should
receive
a
thousand
shekels
of
silver
in
mine
hand
yet
would
i
not
put
forth
mine
hand
against
the
king's
son
for
in
our
hearing
the
king
charged
thee
and
abishai
and
ittai
saying
beware
that
none
touch
the
young
man
absalom
otherwise
i
should
have
wrought
falsehood
against
mine
own
life
for
there
is
no
matter
hid
from
the
king
and
thou
thyself
wouldest
have
set
thyself
against
me
then
said
joab
i
may
not
tarry
thus
with
thee
and
he
took
three
darts
in
his
hand
and
thrust
them
through
the
heart
of
absalom
while
he
was
yet
alive
in
the
midst
of
the
oak
and
ten
young
men
that
bare
joab's
armour
compassed
about
and
smote
absalom
and
slew
him
and
joab
blew
the
trumpet
and
the
people
returned
from
pursuing
after
israel
for
joab
held
back
the
people
and
they
took
absalom
and
cast
him
into
a
great
pit
in
the
wood
and
laid
a
very
great
heap
of
stones
upon
him
and
all
israel
fled
every
one
to
his
tent
now
absalom
in
his
lifetime
had
taken
and
reared
up
for
himself
a
pillar
which
is
in
the
king's
dale
for
he
said
i
have
no
son
to
keep
my
name
in
remembrance
and
he
called
the
pillar
after
his
own
name
and
it
is
called
unto
this
day
absalom's
place
then
said
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
let
me
now
run
and
bear
the
king
tidings
how
that
the
lord
hath
avenged
him
of
his
enemies
and
joab
said
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
bear
tidings
this
day
but
thou
shalt
bear
tidings
another
day
but
this
day
thou
shalt
bear
no
tidings
because
the
king's
son
is
dead
then
said
joab
to
cushi
go
tell
the
king
what
thou
hast
seen
and
cushi
bowed
himself
unto
joab
and
ran
then
said
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
yet
again
to
joab
but
howsoever
let
me
i
pray
thee
also
run
after
cushi
and
joab
said
wherefore
wilt
thou
run
my
son
seeing
that
thou
hast
no
tidings
ready
but
howsoever
said
he
let
me
run
and
he
said
unto
him
run
then
ahimaaz
ran
by
the
way
of
the
plain
and
overran
cushi
and
david
sat
between
the
two
gates
and
the
watchman
went
up
to
the
roof
over
the
gate
unto
the
wall
and
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
and
behold
a
man
running
alone
and
the
watchman
cried
and
told
the
king
and
the
king
said
if
he
be
alone
there
is
tidings
in
his
mouth
and
he
came
apace
and
drew
near
and
the
watchman
saw
another
man
running
and
the
watchman
called
unto
the
porter
and
said
behold
another
man
running
alone
and
the
king
said
he
also
bringeth
tidings
and
the
watchman
said
me
thinketh
the
running
of
the
foremost
is
like
the
running
of
ahimaaz
the
son
of
zadok
and
the
king
said
he
is
a
good
man
and
cometh
with
good
tidings
and
ahimaaz
called
and
said
unto
the
king
all
is
well
and
he
fell
down
to
the
earth
upon
his
face
before
the
king
and
said
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
hath
delivered
up
the
men
that
lifted
up
their
hand
against
my
lord
the
king
and
the
king
said
is
the
young
man
absalom
safe
and
ahimaaz
answered
when
joab
sent
the
king's
servant
and
me
thy
servant
i
saw
a
great
tumult
but
i
knew
not
what
it
was
and
the
king
said
unto
him
turn
aside
and
stand
here
and
he
turned
aside
and
stood
still
and
behold
cushi
came
and
cushi
said
tidings
my
lord
the
king
for
the
lord
hath
avenged
thee
this
day
of
all
them
that
rose
up
against
thee
and
the
king
said
unto
cushi
is
the
young
man
absalom
safe
and
cushi
answered
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
and
all
that
rise
against
thee
to
do
thee
hurt
be
as
that
young
man
is
and
the
king
was
much
moved
and
went
up
to
the
chamber
over
the
gate
and
wept
and
as
he
went
thus
he
said
o
my
son
absalom
my
son
my
son
absalom
would
god
i
had
died
for
thee
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
and
it
was
told
joab
behold
the
king
weepeth
and
mourneth
for
absalom
and
the
victory
that
day
was
turned
into
mourning
unto
all
the
people
for
the
people
heard
say
that
day
how
the
king
was
grieved
for
his
son
and
the
people
gat
them
by
stealth
that
day
into
the
city
as
people
being
ashamed
steal
away
when
they
flee
in
battle
but
the
king
covered
his
face
and
the
king
cried
with
a
loud
voice
o
my
son
absalom
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
and
joab
came
into
the
house
to
the
king
and
said
thou
hast
shamed
this
day
the
faces
of
all
thy
servants
which
this
day
have
saved
thy
life
and
the
lives
of
thy
sons
and
of
thy
daughters
and
the
lives
of
thy
wives
and
the
lives
of
thy
concubines
in
that
thou
lovest
thine
enemies
and
hatest
thy
friends
for
thou
hast
declared
this
day
that
thou
regardest
neither
princes
nor
servants
for
this
day
i
perceive
that
if
absalom
had
lived
and
all
we
had
died
this
day
then
it
had
pleased
thee
well
now
therefore
arise
go
forth
and
speak
comfortably
unto
thy
servants
for
i
swear
by
the
lord
if
thou
go
not
forth
there
will
not
tarry
one
with
thee
this
night
and
that
will
be
worse
unto
thee
than
all
the
evil
that
befell
thee
from
thy
youth
until
now
then
the
king
arose
and
sat
in
the
gate
and
they
told
unto
all
the
people
saying
behold
the
king
doth
sit
in
the
gate
and
all
the
people
came
before
the
king
for
israel
had
fled
every
man
to
his
tent
and
all
the
people
were
at
strife
throughout
all
the
tribes
of
israel
saying
the
king
saved
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
and
he
delivered
us
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
now
he
is
fled
out
of
the
land
for
absalom
and
absalom
whom
we
anointed
over
us
is
dead
in
battle
now
therefore
why
speak
ye
not
a
word
of
bringing
the
king
back
and
king
david
sent
to
zadok
and
to
abiathar
the
priests
saying
speak
unto
the
elders
of
judah
saying
why
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
the
king
back
to
his
house
seeing
the
speech
of
all
israel
is
come
to
the
king
even
to
his
house
ye
are
my
brethren
ye
are
my
bones
and
my
flesh
wherefore
then
are
ye
the
last
to
bring
back
the
king
and
say
ye
to
amasa
art
thou
not
of
my
bone
and
of
my
flesh
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
thou
be
not
captain
of
the
host
before
me
continually
in
the
room
of
joab
and
he
bowed
the
heart
of
all
the
men
of
judah
even
as
the
heart
of
one
man
so
that
they
sent
this
word
unto
the
king
return
thou
and
all
thy
servants
so
the
king
returned
and
came
to
jordan
and
judah
came
to
gilgal
to
go
to
meet
the
king
to
conduct
the
king
over
jordan
and
shimei
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
which
was
of
bahurim
hasted
and
came
down
with
the
men
of
judah
to
meet
king
david
and
there
were
a
thousand
men
of
benjamin
with
him
and
ziba
the
servant
of
the
house
of
saul
and
his
fifteen
sons
and
his
twenty
servants
with
him
and
they
went
over
jordan
before
the
king
and
there
went
over
a
ferry
boat
to
carry
over
the
king's
household
and
to
do
what
he
thought
good
and
shimei
the
son
of
gera
fell
down
before
the
king
as
he
was
come
over
jordan
and
said
unto
the
king
let
not
my
lord
impute
iniquity
unto
me
neither
do
thou
remember
that
which
thy
servant
did
perversely
the
day
that
my
lord
the
king
went
out
of
jerusalem
that
the
king
should
take
it
to
his
heart
for
thy
servant
doth
know
that
i
have
sinned
therefore
behold
i
am
come
the
first
this
day
of
all
the
house
of
joseph
to
go
down
to
meet
my
lord
the
king
but
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
answered
and
said
shall
not
shimei
be
put
to
death
for
this
because
he
cursed
the
lord's
anointed
and
david
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
ye
sons
of
zeruiah
that
ye
should
this
day
be
adversaries
unto
me
shall
there
any
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
in
israel
for
do
not
i
know
that
i
am
this
day
king
over
israel
therefore
the
king
said
unto
shimei
thou
shalt
not
die
and
the
king
sware
unto
him
and
mephibosheth
the
son
of
saul
came
down
to
meet
the
king
and
had
neither
dressed
his
feet
nor
trimmed
his
beard
nor
washed
his
clothes
from
the
day
the
king
departed
until
the
day
he
came
again
in
peace
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
was
come
to
jerusalem
to
meet
the
king
that
the
king
said
unto
him
wherefore
wentest
not
thou
with
me
mephibosheth
and
he
answered
my
lord
o
king
my
servant
deceived
me
for
thy
servant
said
i
will
saddle
me
an
ass
that
i
may
ride
thereon
and
go
to
the
king
because
thy
servant
is
lame
and
he
hath
slandered
thy
servant
unto
my
lord
the
king
but
my
lord
the
king
is
as
an
angel
of
god
do
therefore
what
is
good
in
thine
eyes
for
all
of
my
father's
house
were
but
dead
men
before
my
lord
the
king
yet
didst
thou
set
thy
servant
among
them
that
did
eat
at
thine
own
table
what
right
therefore
have
i
yet
to
cry
any
more
unto
the
king
and
the
king
said
unto
him
why
speakest
thou
any
more
of
thy
matters
i
have
said
thou
and
ziba
divide
the
land
and
mephibosheth
said
unto
the
king
yea
let
him
take
all
forasmuch
as
my
lord
the
king
is
come
again
in
peace
unto
his
own
house
and
barzillai
the
gileadite
came
down
from
rogelim
and
went
over
jordan
with
the
king
to
conduct
him
over
jordan
now
barzillai
was
a
very
aged
man
even
fourscore
years
old
and
he
had
provided
the
king
of
sustenance
while
he
lay
at
mahanaim
for
he
was
a
very
great
man
and
the
king
said
unto
barzillai
come
thou
over
with
me
and
i
will
feed
thee
with
me
in
jerusalem
and
barzillai
said
unto
the
king
how
long
have
i
to
live
that
i
should
go
up
with
the
king
unto
jerusalem
i
am
this
day
fourscore
years
old
and
can
i
discern
between
good
and
evil
can
thy
servant
taste
what
i
eat
or
what
i
drink
can
i
hear
any
more
the
voice
of
singing
men
and
singing
women
wherefore
then
should
thy
servant
be
yet
a
burden
unto
my
lord
the
king
thy
servant
will
go
a
little
way
over
jordan
with
the
king
and
why
should
the
king
recompense
it
me
with
such
a
reward
let
thy
servant
i
pray
thee
turn
back
again
that
i
may
die
in
mine
own
city
and
be
buried
by
the
grave
of
my
father
and
of
my
mother
but
behold
thy
servant
chimham
let
him
go
over
with
my
lord
the
king
and
do
to
him
what
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
and
the
king
answered
chimham
shall
go
over
with
me
and
i
will
do
to
him
that
which
shall
seem
good
unto
thee
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
require
of
me
that
will
i
do
for
thee
and
all
the
people
went
over
jordan
and
when
the
king
was
come
over
the
king
kissed
barzillai
and
blessed
him
and
he
returned
unto
his
own
place
then
the
king
went
on
to
gilgal
and
chimham
went
on
with
him
and
all
the
people
of
judah
conducted
the
king
and
also
half
the
people
of
israel
and
behold
all
the
men
of
israel
came
to
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
why
have
our
brethren
the
men
of
judah
stolen
thee
away
and
have
brought
the
king
and
his
household
and
all
david's
men
with
him
over
jordan
and
all
the
men
of
judah
answered
the
men
of
israel
because
the
king
is
near
of
kin
to
us
wherefore
then
be
ye
angry
for
this
matter
have
we
eaten
at
all
of
the
king's
cost
or
hath
he
given
us
any
gift
and
the
men
of
israel
answered
the
men
of
judah
and
said
we
have
ten
parts
in
the
king
and
we
have
also
more
right
in
david
than
ye
why
then
did
ye
despise
us
that
our
advice
should
not
be
first
had
in
bringing
back
our
king
and
the
words
of
the
men
of
judah
were
fiercer
than
the
words
of
the
men
of
israel
and
there
happened
to
be
there
a
man
of
belial
whose
name
was
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
a
benjamite
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
said
we
have
no
part
in
david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
every
man
to
his
tents
o
israel
so
every
man
of
israel
went
up
from
after
david
and
followed
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
but
the
men
of
judah
clave
unto
their
king
from
jordan
even
to
jerusalem
and
david
came
to
his
house
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
took
the
ten
women
his
concubines
whom
he
had
left
to
keep
the
house
and
put
them
in
ward
and
fed
them
but
went
not
in
unto
them
so
they
were
shut
up
unto
the
day
of
their
death
living
in
widowhood
then
said
the
king
to
amasa
assemble
me
the
men
of
judah
within
three
days
and
be
thou
here
present
so
amasa
went
to
assemble
the
men
of
judah
but
he
tarried
longer
than
the
set
time
which
he
had
appointed
him
and
david
said
to
abishai
now
shall
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
do
us
more
harm
than
did
absalom
take
thou
thy
lord's
servants
and
pursue
after
him
lest
he
get
him
fenced
cities
and
escape
us
and
there
went
out
after
him
joab's
men
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
all
the
mighty
men
and
they
went
out
of
jerusalem
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
when
they
were
at
the
great
stone
which
is
in
gibeon
amasa
went
before
them
and
joab's
garment
that
he
had
put
on
was
girded
unto
him
and
upon
it
a
girdle
with
a
sword
fastened
upon
his
loins
in
the
sheath
thereof
and
as
he
went
forth
it
fell
out
and
joab
said
to
amasa
art
thou
in
health
my
brother
and
joab
took
amasa
by
the
beard
with
the
right
hand
to
kiss
him
but
amasa
took
no
heed
to
the
sword
that
was
in
joab's
hand
so
he
smote
him
therewith
in
the
fifth
rib
and
shed
out
his
bowels
to
the
ground
and
struck
him
not
again
and
he
died
so
joab
and
abishai
his
brother
pursued
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
and
one
of
joab's
men
stood
by
him
and
said
he
that
favoureth
joab
and
he
that
is
for
david
let
him
go
after
joab
and
amasa
wallowed
in
blood
in
the
midst
of
the
highway
and
when
the
man
saw
that
all
the
people
stood
still
he
removed
amasa
out
of
the
highway
into
the
field
and
cast
a
cloth
upon
him
when
he
saw
that
every
one
that
came
by
him
stood
still
when
he
was
removed
out
of
the
highway
all
the
people
went
on
after
joab
to
pursue
after
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
and
he
went
through
all
the
tribes
of
israel
unto
abel
and
to
bethmaachah
and
all
the
berites
and
they
were
gathered
together
and
went
also
after
him
and
they
came
and
besieged
him
in
abel
of
bethmaachah
and
they
cast
up
a
bank
against
the
city
and
it
stood
in
the
trench
and
all
the
people
that
were
with
joab
battered
the
wall
to
throw
it
down
then
cried
a
wise
woman
out
of
the
city
hear
hear
say
i
pray
you
unto
joab
come
near
hither
that
i
may
speak
with
thee
and
when
he
was
come
near
unto
her
the
woman
said
art
thou
joab
and
he
answered
i
am
he
then
she
said
unto
him
hear
the
words
of
thine
handmaid
and
he
answered
i
do
hear
then
she
spake
saying
they
were
wont
to
speak
in
old
time
saying
they
shall
surely
ask
counsel
at
abel
and
so
they
ended
the
matter
i
am
one
of
them
that
are
peaceable
and
faithful
in
israel
thou
seekest
to
destroy
a
city
and
a
mother
in
israel
why
wilt
thou
swallow
up
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
and
joab
answered
and
said
far
be
it
far
be
it
from
me
that
i
should
swallow
up
or
destroy
the
matter
is
not
so
but
a
man
of
mount
ephraim
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
by
name
hath
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
even
against
david
deliver
him
only
and
i
will
depart
from
the
city
and
the
woman
said
unto
joab
behold
his
head
shall
be
thrown
to
thee
over
the
wall
then
the
woman
went
unto
all
the
people
in
her
wisdom
and
they
cut
off
the
head
of
sheba
the
son
of
bichri
and
cast
it
out
to
joab
and
he
blew
a
trumpet
and
they
retired
from
the
city
every
man
to
his
tent
and
joab
returned
to
jerusalem
unto
the
king
now
joab
was
over
all
the
host
of
israel
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
was
over
the
cherethites
and
over
the
pelethites
and
adoram
was
over
the
tribute
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
ahilud
was
recorder
and
sheva
was
scribe
and
zadok
and
abiathar
were
the
priests
and
ira
also
the
jairite
was
a
chief
ruler
about
david
then
there
was
a
famine
in
the
days
of
david
three
years
year
after
year
and
david
enquired
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
answered
it
is
for
saul
and
for
his
bloody
house
because
he
slew
the
gibeonites
and
the
king
called
the
gibeonites
and
said
unto
them
now
the
gibeonites
were
not
of
the
children
of
israel
but
of
the
remnant
of
the
amorites
and
the
children
of
israel
had
sworn
unto
them
and
saul
sought
to
slay
them
in
his
zeal
to
the
children
of
israel
and
judah
wherefore
david
said
unto
the
gibeonites
what
shall
i
do
for
you
and
wherewith
shall
i
make
the
atonement
that
ye
may
bless
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
and
the
gibeonites
said
unto
him
we
will
have
no
silver
nor
gold
of
saul
nor
of
his
house
neither
for
us
shalt
thou
kill
any
man
in
israel
and
he
said
what
ye
shall
say
that
will
i
do
for
you
and
they
answered
the
king
the
man
that
consumed
us
and
that
devised
against
us
that
we
should
be
destroyed
from
remaining
in
any
of
the
coasts
of
israel
let
seven
men
of
his
sons
be
delivered
unto
us
and
we
will
hang
them
up
unto
the
lord
in
gibeah
of
saul
whom
the
lord
did
choose
and
the
king
said
i
will
give
them
but
the
king
spared
mephibosheth
the
son
of
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
because
of
the
lord's
oath
that
was
between
them
between
david
and
jonathan
the
son
of
saul
but
the
king
took
the
two
sons
of
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
whom
she
bare
unto
saul
armoni
and
mephibosheth
and
the
five
sons
of
michal
the
daughter
of
saul
whom
she
brought
up
for
adriel
the
son
of
barzillai
the
meholathite
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
gibeonites
and
they
hanged
them
in
the
hill
before
the
lord
and
they
fell
all
seven
together
and
were
put
to
death
in
the
days
of
harvest
in
the
first
days
in
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest
and
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
took
sackcloth
and
spread
it
for
her
upon
the
rock
from
the
beginning
of
harvest
until
water
dropped
upon
them
out
of
heaven
and
suffered
neither
the
birds
of
the
air
to
rest
on
them
by
day
nor
the
beasts
of
the
field
by
night
and
it
was
told
david
what
rizpah
the
daughter
of
aiah
the
concubine
of
saul
had
done
and
david
went
and
took
the
bones
of
saul
and
the
bones
of
jonathan
his
son
from
the
men
of
jabeshgilead
which
had
stolen
them
from
the
street
of
bethshan
where
the
philistines
had
hanged
them
when
the
philistines
had
slain
saul
in
gilboa
and
he
brought
up
from
thence
the
bones
of
saul
and
the
bones
of
jonathan
his
son
and
they
gathered
the
bones
of
them
that
were
hanged
and
the
bones
of
saul
and
jonathan
his
son
buried
they
in
the
country
of
benjamin
in
zelah
in
the
sepulchre
of
kish
his
father
and
they
performed
all
that
the
king
commanded
and
after
that
god
was
intreated
for
the
land
moreover
the
philistines
had
yet
war
again
with
israel
and
david
went
down
and
his
servants
with
him
and
fought
against
the
philistines
and
david
waxed
faint
and
ishbibenob
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant
the
weight
of
whose
spear
weighed
three
hundred
shekels
of
brass
in
weight
he
being
girded
with
a
new
sword
thought
to
have
slain
david
but
abishai
the
son
of
zeruiah
succoured
him
and
smote
the
philistine
and
killed
him
then
the
men
of
david
sware
unto
him
saying
thou
shalt
go
no
more
out
with
us
to
battle
that
thou
quench
not
the
light
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
there
was
again
a
battle
with
the
philistines
at
gob
then
sibbechai
the
hushathite
slew
saph
which
was
of
the
sons
of
the
giant
and
there
was
again
a
battle
in
gob
with
the
philistines
where
elhanan
the
son
of
jaareoregim
a
bethlehemite
slew
the
brother
of
goliath
the
gittite
the
staff
of
whose
spear
was
like
a
weaver's
beam
and
there
was
yet
a
battle
in
gath
where
was
a
man
of
great
stature
that
had
on
every
hand
six
fingers
and
on
every
foot
six
toes
four
and
twenty
in
number
and
he
also
was
born
to
the
giant
and
when
he
defied
israel
jonathan
the
son
of
shimeah
the
brother
of
david
slew
him
these
four
were
born
to
the
giant
in
gath
and
fell
by
the
hand
of
david
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
david
spake
unto
the
lord
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
day
that
the
lord
had
delivered
him
out
of
the
hand
of
all
his
enemies
and
out
of
the
hand
of
saul
and
he
said
the
lord
is
my
rock
and
my
fortress
and
my
deliverer
the
god
of
my
rock
in
him
will
i
trust
he
is
my
shield
and
the
horn
of
my
salvation
my
high
tower
and
my
refuge
my
saviour
thou
savest
me
from
violence
i
will
call
on
the
lord
who
is
worthy
to
be
praised
so
shall
i
be
saved
from
mine
enemies
when
the
waves
of
death
compassed
me
the
floods
of
ungodly
men
made
me
afraid
the
sorrows
of
hell
compassed
me
about
the
snares
of
death
prevented
me
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
and
cried
to
my
god
and
he
did
hear
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
did
enter
into
his
ears
then
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
the
foundations
of
heaven
moved
and
shook
because
he
was
wroth
there
went
up
a
smoke
out
of
his
nostrils
and
fire
out
of
his
mouth
devoured
coals
were
kindled
by
it
he
bowed
the
heavens
also
and
came
down
and
darkness
was
under
his
feet
and
he
rode
upon
a
cherub
and
did
fly
and
he
was
seen
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
he
made
darkness
pavilions
round
about
him
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
through
the
brightness
before
him
were
coals
of
fire
kindled
the
lord
thundered
from
heaven
and
the
most
high
uttered
his
voice
and
he
sent
out
arrows
and
scattered
them
lightning
and
discomfited
them
and
the
channels
of
the
sea
appeared
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
discovered
at
the
rebuking
of
the
lord
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
he
sent
from
above
he
took
me
he
drew
me
out
of
many
waters
he
delivered
me
from
my
strong
enemy
and
from
them
that
hated
me
for
they
were
too
strong
for
me
they
prevented
me
in
the
day
of
my
calamity
but
the
lord
was
my
stay
he
brought
me
forth
also
into
a
large
place
he
delivered
me
because
he
delighted
in
me
the
lord
rewarded
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
the
cleanness
of
my
hands
hath
he
recompensed
me
for
i
have
kept
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
have
not
wickedly
departed
from
my
god
for
all
his
judgments
were
before
me
and
as
for
his
statutes
i
did
not
depart
from
them
i
was
also
upright
before
him
and
have
kept
myself
from
mine
iniquity
therefore
the
lord
hath
recompensed
me
according
to
my
righteousness
according
to
my
cleanness
in
his
eye
sight
with
the
merciful
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
merciful
and
with
the
upright
man
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
upright
with
the
pure
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
pure
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
shew
thyself
unsavoury
and
the
afflicted
people
thou
wilt
save
but
thine
eyes
are
upon
the
haughty
that
thou
mayest
bring
them
down
for
thou
art
my
lamp
o
lord
and
the
lord
will
lighten
my
darkness
for
by
thee
i
have
run
through
a
troop
by
my
god
have
i
leaped
over
a
wall
as
for
god
his
way
is
perfect
the
word
of
the
lord
is
tried
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
them
that
trust
in
him
for
who
is
god
save
the
lord
and
who
is
a
rock
save
our
god
god
is
my
strength
and
power
and
he
maketh
my
way
perfect
he
maketh
my
feet
like
hinds
feet
and
setteth
me
upon
my
high
places
he
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
mine
arms
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
shield
of
thy
salvation
and
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great
thou
hast
enlarged
my
steps
under
me
so
that
my
feet
did
not
slip
i
have
pursued
mine
enemies
and
destroyed
them
and
turned
not
again
until
i
had
consumed
them
and
i
have
consumed
them
and
wounded
them
that
they
could
not
arise
yea
they
are
fallen
under
my
feet
for
thou
hast
girded
me
with
strength
to
battle
them
that
rose
up
against
me
hast
thou
subdued
under
me
thou
hast
also
given
me
the
necks
of
mine
enemies
that
i
might
destroy
them
that
hate
me
they
looked
but
there
was
none
to
save
even
unto
the
lord
but
he
answered
them
not
then
did
i
beat
them
as
small
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
i
did
stamp
them
as
the
mire
of
the
street
and
did
spread
them
abroad
thou
also
hast
delivered
me
from
the
strivings
of
my
people
thou
hast
kept
me
to
be
head
of
the
heathen
a
people
which
i
knew
not
shall
serve
me
strangers
shall
submit
themselves
unto
me
as
soon
as
they
hear
they
shall
be
obedient
unto
me
strangers
shall
fade
away
and
they
shall
be
afraid
out
of
their
close
places
the
lord
liveth
and
blessed
be
my
rock
and
exalted
be
the
god
of
the
rock
of
my
salvation
it
is
god
that
avengeth
me
and
that
bringeth
down
the
people
under
me
and
that
bringeth
me
forth
from
mine
enemies
thou
also
hast
lifted
me
up
on
high
above
them
that
rose
up
against
me
thou
hast
delivered
me
from
the
violent
man
therefore
i
will
give
thanks
unto
thee
o
lord
among
the
heathen
and
i
will
sing
praises
unto
thy
name
he
is
the
tower
of
salvation
for
his
king
and
sheweth
mercy
to
his
anointed
unto
david
and
to
his
seed
for
evermore
now
these
be
the
last
words
of
david
david
the
son
of
jesse
said
and
the
man
who
was
raised
up
on
high
the
anointed
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
the
sweet
psalmist
of
israel
said
the
spirit
of
the
lord
spake
by
me
and
his
word
was
in
my
tongue
the
god
of
israel
said
the
rock
of
israel
spake
to
me
he
that
ruleth
over
men
must
be
just
ruling
in
the
fear
of
god
and
he
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
morning
when
the
sun
riseth
even
a
morning
without
clouds
as
the
tender
grass
springing
out
of
the
earth
by
clear
shining
after
rain
although
my
house
be
not
so
with
god
yet
he
hath
made
with
me
an
everlasting
covenant
ordered
in
all
things
and
sure
for
this
is
all
my
salvation
and
all
my
desire
although
he
make
it
not
to
grow
but
the
sons
of
belial
shall
be
all
of
them
as
thorns
thrust
away
because
they
cannot
be
taken
with
hands
but
the
man
that
shall
touch
them
must
be
fenced
with
iron
and
the
staff
of
a
spear
and
they
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
in
the
same
place
these
be
the
names
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
the
tachmonite
that
sat
in
the
seat
chief
among
the
captains
the
same
was
adino
the
eznite
he
lift
up
his
spear
against
eight
hundred
whom
he
slew
at
one
time
and
after
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
dodo
the
ahohite
one
of
the
three
mighty
men
with
david
when
they
defied
the
philistines
that
were
there
gathered
together
to
battle
and
the
men
of
israel
were
gone
away
he
arose
and
smote
the
philistines
until
his
hand
was
weary
and
his
hand
clave
unto
the
sword
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
victory
that
day
and
the
people
returned
after
him
only
to
spoil
and
after
him
was
shammah
the
son
of
agee
the
hararite
and
the
philistines
were
gathered
together
into
a
troop
where
was
a
piece
of
ground
full
of
lentiles
and
the
people
fled
from
the
philistines
but
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
ground
and
defended
it
and
slew
the
philistines
and
the
lord
wrought
a
great
victory
and
three
of
the
thirty
chief
went
down
and
came
to
david
in
the
harvest
time
unto
the
cave
of
adullam
and
the
troop
of
the
philistines
pitched
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
and
david
was
then
in
an
hold
and
the
garrison
of
the
philistines
was
then
in
bethlehem
and
david
longed
and
said
oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
which
is
by
the
gate
and
the
three
mighty
men
brake
through
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
was
by
the
gate
and
took
it
and
brought
it
to
david
nevertheless
he
would
not
drink
thereof
but
poured
it
out
unto
the
lord
and
he
said
be
it
far
from
me
o
lord
that
i
should
do
this
is
not
this
the
blood
of
the
men
that
went
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives
therefore
he
would
not
drink
it
these
things
did
these
three
mighty
men
and
abishai
the
brother
of
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
was
chief
among
three
and
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
and
slew
them
and
had
the
name
among
three
was
he
not
most
honourable
of
three
therefore
he
was
their
captain
howbeit
he
attained
not
unto
the
first
three
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
the
son
of
a
valiant
man
of
kabzeel
who
had
done
many
acts
he
slew
two
lionlike
men
of
moab
he
went
down
also
and
slew
a
lion
in
the
midst
of
a
pit
in
time
of
snow
and
he
slew
an
egyptian
a
goodly
man
and
the
egyptian
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
but
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
egyptian's
hand
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear
these
things
did
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
had
the
name
among
three
mighty
men
he
was
more
honourable
than
the
thirty
but
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three
and
david
set
him
over
his
guard
asahel
the

thirty
and

in

and
again
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
moved
david
against
them
to
say
go
number
israel
and
judah
for
the
king
said
to
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
which
was
with
him
go
now
through
all
the
tribes
of
israel
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
and
number
ye
the
people
that
i
may
know
the
number
of
the
people
and
joab
said
unto
the
king
now
the
lord
thy
god
add
unto
the
people
how
many
soever
they
be
an
hundredfold
and
that
the
eyes
of
my
lord
the
king
may
see
it
but
why
doth
my
lord
the
king
delight
in
this
thing
notwithstanding
the
king's
word
prevailed
against
joab
and
against
the
captains
of
the
host
and
joab
and
the
captains
of
the
host
went
out
from
the
presence
of
the
king
to
number
the
people
of
israel
and
they
passed
over
jordan
and
pitched
in
aroer
on
the
right
side
of
the
city
that
lieth
in
the
midst
of
the
river
of
gad
and
toward
jazer
then
they
came
to
gilead
and
to
the
land
of
tahtimhodshi
and
they
came
to
danjaan
and
about
to
zidon
and
came
to
the
strong
hold
of
tyre
and
to
all
the
cities
of
the
hivites
and
of
the
canaanites
and
they
went
out
to
the
south
of
judah
even
to
beersheba
so
when
they
had
gone
through
all
the
land
they
came
to
jerusalem
at
the
end
of
nine
months
and
twenty
days
and
joab
gave
up
the
sum
of
the
number
of
the
people
unto
the
king
and
there
were
in
israel
eight
hundred
thousand
valiant
men
that
drew
the
sword
and
the
men
of
judah
were
five
hundred
thousand
men
and
david's
heart
smote
him
after
that
he
had
numbered
the
people
and
david
said
unto
the
lord
i
have
sinned
greatly
in
that
i
have
done
and
now
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
take
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
servant
for
i
have
done
very
foolishly
for
when
david
was
up
in
the
morning
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
the
prophet
gad
david's
seer
saying
go
and
say
unto
david
thus
saith
the
lord
i
offer
thee
three
things
choose
thee
one
of
them
that
i
may
do
it
unto
thee
so
gad
came
to
david
and
told
him
and
said
unto
him
shall
seven
years
of
famine
come
unto
thee
in
thy
land
or
wilt
thou
flee
three
months
before
thine
enemies
while
they
pursue
thee
or
that
there
be
three
days
pestilence
in
thy
land
now
advise
and
see
what
answer
i
shall
return
to
him
that
sent
me
and
david
said
unto
gad
i
am
in
a
great
strait
let
us
fall
now
into
the
hand
of
the
lord
for
his
mercies
are
great
and
let
me
not
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
so
the
lord
sent
a
pestilence
upon
israel
from
the
morning
even
to
the
time
appointed
and
there
died
of
the
people
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
seventy
thousand
men
and
when
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
upon
jerusalem
to
destroy
it
the
lord
repented
him
of
the
evil
and
said
to
the
angel
that
destroyed
the
people
it
is
enough
stay
now
thine
hand
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
was
by
the
threshingplace
of
araunah
the
jebusite
and
david
spake
unto
the
lord
when
he
saw
the
angel
that
smote
the
people
and
said
lo
i
have
sinned
and
i
have
done
wickedly
but
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thine
hand
i
pray
thee
be
against
me
and
against
my
father's
house
and
gad
came
that
day
to
david
and
said
unto
him
go
up
rear
an
altar
unto
the
lord
in
the
threshingfloor
of
araunah
the
jebusite
and
david
according
to
the
saying
of
gad
went
up
as
the
lord
commanded
and
araunah
looked
and
saw
the
king
and
his
servants
coming
on
toward
him
and
araunah
went
out
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
on
his
face
upon
the
ground
and
araunah
said
wherefore
is
my
lord
the
king
come
to
his
servant
and
david
said
to
buy
the
threshingfloor
of
thee
to
build
an
altar
unto
the
lord
that
the
plague
may
be
stayed
from
the
people
and
araunah
said
unto
david
let
my
lord
the
king
take
and
offer
up
what
seemeth
good
unto
him
behold
here
be
oxen
for
burnt
sacrifice
and
threshing
instruments
and
other
instruments
of
the
oxen
for
wood
all
these
things
did
araunah
as
a
king
give
unto
the
king
and
araunah
said
unto
the
king
the
lord
thy
god
accept
thee
and
the
king
said
unto
araunah
nay
but
i
will
surely
buy
it
of
thee
at
a
price
neither
will
i
offer
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
my
god
of
that
which
doth
cost
me
nothing
so
david
bought
the
threshingfloor
and
the
oxen
for
fifty
shekels
of
silver
and
david
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
offered
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
so
the
lord
was
intreated
for
the
land
and
the
plague
was
stayed
from
israel
the
first
book
of
the
kings
commonly
called
the
third
book
of
the
kings
now
king
david
was
old
and
stricken
in
years
and
they
covered
him
with
clothes
but
he
gat
no
heat
wherefore
his
servants
said
unto
him
let
there
be
sought
for
my
lord
the
king
a
young
virgin
and
let
her
stand
before
the
king
and
let
her
cherish
him
and
let
her
lie
in
thy
bosom
that
my
lord
the
king
may
get
heat
so
they
sought
for
a
fair
damsel
throughout
all
the
coasts
of
israel
and
found
abishag
a
shunammite
and
brought
her
to
the
king
and
the
damsel
was
very
fair
and
cherished
the
king
and
ministered
to
him
but
the
king
knew
her
not
then
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
exalted
himself
saying
i
will
be
king
and
he
prepared
him
chariots
and
horsemen
and
fifty
men
to
run
before
him
and
his
father
had
not
displeased
him
at
any
time
in
saying
why
hast
thou
done
so
and
he
also
was
a
very
goodly
man
and
his
mother
bare
him
after
absalom
and
he
conferred
with
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
and
with
abiathar
the
priest
and
they
following
adonijah
helped
him
but
zadok
the
priest
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
shimei
and
rei
and
the
mighty
men
which
belonged
to
david
were
not
with
adonijah
and
adonijah
slew
sheep
and
oxen
and
fat
cattle
by
the
stone
of
zoheleth
which
is
by
enrogel
and
called
all
his
brethren
the
king's
sons
and
all
the
men
of
judah
the
king's
servants
but
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
and
the
mighty
men
and
solomon
his
brother
he
called
not
wherefore
nathan
spake
unto
bathsheba
the
mother
of
solomon
saying
hast
thou
not
heard
that
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
doth
reign
and
david
our
lord
knoweth
it
not
now
therefore
come
let
me
i
pray
thee
give
thee
counsel
that
thou
mayest
save
thine
own
life
and
the
life
of
thy
son
solomon
go
and
get
thee
in
unto
king
david
and
say
unto
him
didst
not
thou
my
lord
o
king
swear
unto
thine
handmaid
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
why
then
doth
adonijah
reign
behold
while
thou
yet
talkest
there
with
the
king
i
also
will
come
in
after
thee
and
confirm
thy
words
and
bathsheba
went
in
unto
the
king
into
the
chamber
and
the
king
was
very
old
and
abishag
the
shunammite
ministered
unto
the
king
and
bathsheba
bowed
and
did
obeisance
unto
the
king
and
the
king
said
what
wouldest
thou
and
she
said
unto
him
my
lord
thou
swarest
by
the
lord
thy
god
unto
thine
handmaid
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
and
now
behold
adonijah
reigneth
and
now
my
lord
the
king
thou
knowest
it
not
and
he
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
sons
of
the
king
and
abiathar
the
priest
and
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
but
solomon
thy
servant
hath
he
not
called
and
thou
my
lord
o
king
the
eyes
of
all
israel
are
upon
thee
that
thou
shouldest
tell
them
who
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
otherwise
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
my
lord
the
king
shall
sleep
with
his
fathers
that
i
and
my
son
solomon
shall
be
counted
offenders
and
lo
while
she
yet
talked
with
the
king
nathan
the
prophet
also
came
in
and
they
told
the
king
saying
behold
nathan
the
prophet
and
when
he
was
come
in
before
the
king
he
bowed
himself
before
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
nathan
said
my
lord
o
king
hast
thou
said
adonijah
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
for
he
is
gone
down
this
day
and
hath
slain
oxen
and
fat
cattle
and
sheep
in
abundance
and
hath
called
all
the
king's
sons
and
the
captains
of
the
host
and
abiathar
the
priest
and
behold
they
eat
and
drink
before
him
and
say
god
save
king
adonijah
but
me
even
me
thy
servant
and
zadok
the
priest
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
thy
servant
solomon
hath
he
not
called
is
this
thing
done
by
my
lord
the
king
and
thou
hast
not
shewed
it
unto
thy
servant
who
should
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
then
king
david
answered
and
said
call
me
bathsheba
and
she
came
into
the
king's
presence
and
stood
before
the
king
and
the
king
sware
and
said
as
the
lord
liveth
that
hath
redeemed
my
soul
out
of
all
distress
even
as
i
sware
unto
thee
by
the
lord
god
of
israel
saying
assuredly
solomon
thy
son
shall
reign
after
me
and
he
shall
sit
upon
my
throne
in
my
stead
even
so
will
i
certainly
do
this
day
then
bathsheba
bowed
with
her
face
to
the
earth
and
did
reverence
to
the
king
and
said
let
my
lord
king
david
live
for
ever
and
king
david
said
call
me
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
they
came
before
the
king
the
king
also
said
unto
them

with
you
the
servants
of
your
lord
and
cause
solomon
my
son
to
ride
upon
mine
own
mule
and
bring
him
down
to
gihon
and
let
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
anoint
him
there
king
over
israel
and
blow
ye
with
the
trumpet
and
say
god
save
king
solomon
then
ye
shall
come
up
after
him
that
he
may
come
and
sit
upon
my
throne
for
he
shall
be
king
in
my
stead
and
i
have
appointed
him
to
be
ruler
over
israel
and
over
judah
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
answered
the
king
and
said
amen
the
lord
god
of
my
lord
the
king
say
so
too
as
the
lord
hath
been
with
my
lord
the
king
even
so
be
he
with
solomon
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
the
throne
of
my
lord
king
david
so
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
went
down
and
caused
solomon
to
ride
upon
king
david's
mule
and
brought
him
to
gihon
and
zadok
the
priest
took
an
horn
of
oil
out
of
the
tabernacle
and
anointed
solomon
and
they
blew
the
trumpet
and
all
the
people
said
god
save
king
solomon
and
all
the
people
came
up
after
him
and
the
people
piped
with
pipes
and
rejoiced
with
great
joy
so
that
the
earth
rent
with
the
sound
of
them
and
adonijah
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
him
heard
it
as
they
had
made
an
end
of
eating
and
when
joab
heard
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
he
said
wherefore
is
this
noise
of
the
city
being
in
an
uproar
and
while
he
yet
spake
behold
jonathan
the
son
of
abiathar
the
priest
came
and
adonijah
said
unto
him
come
in
for
thou
art
a
valiant
man
and
bringest
good
tidings
and
jonathan
answered
and
said
to
adonijah
verily
our
lord
king
david
hath
made
solomon
king
and
the
king
hath
sent
with
him
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
and
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
the
cherethites
and
the
pelethites
and
they
have
caused
him
to
ride
upon
the
king's
mule
and
zadok
the
priest
and
nathan
the
prophet
have
anointed
him
king
in
gihon
and
they
are
come
up
from
thence
rejoicing
so
that
the
city
rang
again
this
is
the
noise
that
ye
have
heard
and
also
solomon
sitteth
on
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
and
moreover
the
king's
servants
came
to
bless
our
lord
king
david
saying
god
make
the
name
of
solomon
better
than
thy
name
and
make
his
throne
greater
than
thy
throne
and
the
king
bowed
himself
upon
the
bed
and
also
thus
said
the
king
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
hath
given
one
to
sit
on
my
throne
this
day
mine
eyes
even
seeing
it
and
all
the
guests
that
were
with
adonijah
were
afraid
and
rose
up
and
went
every
man
his
way
and
adonijah
feared
because
of
solomon
and
arose
and
went
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
and
it
was
told
solomon
saying
behold
adonijah
feareth
king
solomon
for
lo
he
hath
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
saying
let
king
solomon
swear
unto
me
today
that
he
will
not
slay
his
servant
with
the
sword
and
solomon
said
if
he
will
shew
himself
a
worthy
man
there
shall
not
an
hair
of
him
fall
to
the
earth
but
if
wickedness
shall
be
found
in
him
he
shall
die
so
king
solomon
sent
and
they
brought
him
down
from
the
altar
and
he
came
and
bowed
himself
to
king
solomon
and
solomon
said
unto
him
go
to
thine
house
now
the
days
of
david
drew
nigh
that
he
should
die
and
he
charged
solomon
his
son
saying
i
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
be
thou
strong
therefore
and
shew
thyself
a
man
and
keep
the
charge
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
his
ways
to
keep
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
and
his
judgments
and
his
testimonies
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
of
moses
that
thou
mayest
prosper
in
all
that
thou
doest
and
whithersoever
thou
turnest
thyself
that
the
lord
may
continue
his
word
which
he
spake
concerning
me
saying
if
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
to
walk
before
me
in
truth
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
there
shall
not
fail
thee
said
he
a
man
on
the
throne
of
israel
moreover
thou
knowest
also
what
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
did
to
me
and
what
he
did
to
the
two
captains
of
the
hosts
of
israel
unto
abner
the
son
of
ner
and
unto
amasa
the
son
of
jether
whom
he
slew
and
shed
the
blood
of
war
in
peace
and
put
the
blood
of
war
upon
his
girdle
that
was
about
his
loins
and
in
his
shoes
that
were
on
his
feet
do
therefore
according
to
thy
wisdom
and
let
not
his
hoar
head
go
down
to
the
grave
in
peace
but
shew
kindness
unto
the
sons
of
barzillai
the
gileadite
and
let
them
be
of
those
that
eat
at
thy
table
for
so
they
came
to
me
when
i
fled
because
of
absalom
thy
brother
and
behold
thou
hast
with
thee
shimei
the
son
of
gera
a
benjamite
of
bahurim
which
cursed
me
with
a
grievous
curse
in
the
day
when
i
went
to
mahanaim
but
he
came
down
to
meet
me
at
jordan
and
i
sware
to
him
by
the
lord
saying
i
will
not
put
thee
to
death
with
the
sword
now
therefore
hold
him
not
guiltless
for
thou
art
a
wise
man
and
knowest
what
thou
oughtest
to
do
unto
him
but
his
hoar
head
bring
thou
down
to
the
grave
with
blood
so
david
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
and
the
days
that
david
reigned
over
israel
were
forty
years
seven
years
reigned
he
in
hebron
and
thirty
and
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
then
sat
solomon
upon
the
throne
of
david
his
father
and
his
kingdom
was
established
greatly
and
adonijah
the
son
of
haggith
came
to
bathsheba
the
mother
of
solomon
and
she
said
comest
thou
peaceably
and
he
said
peaceably
he
said
moreover
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
thee
and
she
said
say
on
and
he
said
thou
knowest
that
the
kingdom
was
mine
and
that
all
israel
set
their
faces
on
me
that
i
should
reign
howbeit
the
kingdom
is
turned
about
and
is
become
my
brother's
for
it
was
his
from
the
lord
and
now
i
ask
one
petition
of
thee
deny
me
not
and
she
said
unto
him
say
on
and
he
said
speak
i
pray
thee
unto
solomon
the
king
for
he
will
not
say
thee
nay
that
he
give
me
abishag
the
shunammite
to
wife
and
bathsheba
said
well
i
will
speak
for
thee
unto
the
king
bathsheba
therefore
went
unto
king
solomon
to
speak
unto
him
for
adonijah
and
the
king
rose
up
to
meet
her
and
bowed
himself
unto
her
and
sat
down
on
his
throne
and
caused
a
seat
to
be
set
for
the
king's
mother
and
she
sat
on
his
right
hand
then
she
said
i
desire
one
small
petition
of
thee
i
pray
thee
say
me
not
nay
and
the
king
said
unto
her
ask
on
my
mother
for
i
will
not
say
thee
nay
and
she
said
let
abishag
the
shunammite
be
given
to
adonijah
thy
brother
to
wife
and
king
solomon
answered
and
said
unto
his
mother
and
why
dost
thou
ask
abishag
the
shunammite
for
adonijah
ask
for
him
the
kingdom
also
for
he
is
mine
elder
brother
even
for
him
and
for
abiathar
the
priest
and
for
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
then
king
solomon
sware
by
the
lord
saying
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
adonijah
have
not
spoken
this
word
against
his
own
life
now
therefore
as
the
lord
liveth
which
hath
established
me
and
set
me
on
the
throne
of
david
my
father
and
who
hath
made
me
an
house
as
he
promised
adonijah
shall
be
put
to
death
this
day
and
king
solomon
sent
by
the
hand
of
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
he
fell
upon
him
that
he
died
and
unto
abiathar
the
priest
said
the
king
get
thee
to
anathoth
unto
thine
own
fields
for
thou
art
worthy
of
death
but
i
will
not
at
this
time
put
thee
to
death
because
thou
barest
the
ark
of
the
lord
god
before
david
my
father
and
because
thou
hast
been
afflicted
in
all
wherein
my
father
was
afflicted
so
solomon
thrust
out
abiathar
from
being
priest
unto
the
lord
that
he
might
fulfil
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
concerning
the
house
of
eli
in
shiloh
then
tidings
came
to
joab
for
joab
had
turned
after
adonijah
though
he
turned
not
after
absalom
and
joab
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
caught
hold
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
and
it
was
told
king
solomon
that
joab
was
fled
unto
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
behold
he
is
by
the
altar
then
solomon
sent
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
saying
go
fall
upon
him
and
benaiah
came
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
king
come
forth
and
he
said
nay
but
i
will
die
here
and
benaiah
brought
the
king
word
again
saying
thus
said
joab
and
thus
he
answered
me
and
the
king
said
unto
him
do
as
he
hath
said
and
fall
upon
him
and
bury
him
that
thou
mayest
take
away
the
innocent
blood
which
joab
shed
from
me
and
from
the
house
of
my
father
and
the
lord
shall
return
his
blood
upon
his
own
head
who
fell
upon
two
men
more
righteous
and
better
than
he
and
slew
them
with
the
sword
my
father
david
not
knowing
thereof
to
wit
abner
the
son
of
ner
captain
of
the
host
of
israel
and
amasa
the
son
of
jether
captain
of
the
host
of
judah
their
blood
shall
therefore
return
upon
the
head
of
joab
and
upon
the
head
of
his
seed
for
ever
but
upon
david
and
upon
his
seed
and
upon
his
house
and
upon
his
throne
shall
there
be
peace
for
ever
from
the
lord
so
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
went
up
and
fell
upon
him
and
slew
him
and
he
was
buried
in
his
own
house
in
the
wilderness
and
the
king
put
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
in
his
room
over
the
host
and
zadok
the
priest
did
the
king
put
in
the
room
of
abiathar
and
the
king
sent
and
called
for
shimei
and
said
unto
him
build
thee
an
house
in
jerusalem
and
dwell
there
and
go
not
forth
thence
any
whither
for
it
shall
be
that
on
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
passest
over
the
brook
kidron
thou
shalt
know
for
certain
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thy
blood
shall
be
upon
thine
own
head
and
shimei
said
unto
the
king
the
saying
is
good
as
my
lord
the
king
hath
said
so
will
thy
servant
do
and
shimei
dwelt
in
jerusalem
many
days
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
three
years
that
two
of
the
servants
of
shimei
ran
away
unto
achish
son
of
maachah
king
of
gath
and
they
told
shimei
saying
behold
thy
servants
be
in
gath
and
shimei
arose
and
saddled
his
ass
and
went
to
gath
to
achish
to
seek
his
servants
and
shimei
went
and
brought
his
servants
from
gath
and
it
was
told
solomon
that
shimei
had
gone
from
jerusalem
to
gath
and
was
come
again
and
the
king
sent
and
called
for
shimei
and
said
unto
him
did
i
not
make
thee
to
swear
by
the
lord
and
protested
unto
thee
saying
know
for
a
certain
on
the
day
thou
goest
out
and
walkest
abroad
any
whither
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
thou
saidst
unto
me
the
word
that
i
have
heard
is
good
why
then
hast
thou
not
kept
the
oath
of
the
lord
and
the
commandment
that
i
have
charged
thee
with
the
king
said
moreover
to
shimei
thou
knowest
all
the
wickedness
which
thine
heart
is
privy
to
that
thou
didst
to
david
my
father
therefore
the
lord
shall
return
thy
wickedness
upon
thine
own
head
and
king
solomon
shall
be
blessed
and
the
throne
of
david
shall
be
established
before
the
lord
for
ever
so
the
king
commanded
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
which
went
out
and
fell
upon
him
that
he
died
and
the
kingdom
was
established
in
the
hand
of
solomon
and
solomon
made
affinity
with
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
took
pharaoh's
daughter
and
brought
her
into
the
city
of
david
until
he
had
made
an
end
of
building
his
own
house
and
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
wall
of
jerusalem
round
about
only
the
people
sacrificed
in
high
places
because
there
was
no
house
built
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
until
those
days
and
solomon
loved
the
lord
walking
in
the
statutes
of
david
his
father
only
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
high
places
and
the
king
went
to
gibeon
to
sacrifice
there
for
that
was
the
great
high
place
a
thousand
burnt
offerings
did
solomon
offer
upon
that
altar
in
gibeon
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
in
a
dream
by
night
and
god
said
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
and
solomon
said
thou
hast
shewed
unto
thy
servant
david
my
father
great
mercy
according
as
he
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
in
righteousness
and
in
uprightness
of
heart
with
thee
and
thou
hast
kept
for
him
this
great
kindness
that
thou
hast
given
him
a
son
to
sit
on
his
throne
as
it
is
this
day
and
now
o
lord
my
god
thou
hast
made
thy
servant
king
instead
of
david
my
father
and
i
am
but
a
little
child
i
know
not
how
to
go
out
or
come
in
and
thy
servant
is
in
the
midst
of
thy
people
which
thou
hast
chosen
a
great
people
that
cannot
be
numbered
nor
counted
for
multitude
give
therefore
thy
servant
an
understanding
heart
to
judge
thy
people
that
i
may
discern
between
good
and
bad
for
who
is
able
to
judge
this
thy
so
great
a
people
and
the
speech
pleased
the
lord
that
solomon
had
asked
this
thing
and
god
said
unto
him
because
thou
hast
asked
this
thing
and
hast
not
asked
for
thyself
long
life
neither
hast
asked
riches
for
thyself
nor
hast
asked
the
life
of
thine
enemies
but
hast
asked
for
thyself
understanding
to
discern
judgment
behold
i
have
done
according
to
thy
words
lo
i
have
given
thee
a
wise
and
an
understanding
heart
so
that
there
was
none
like
thee
before
thee
neither
after
thee
shall
any
arise
like
unto
thee
and
i
have
also
given
thee
that
which
thou
hast
not
asked
both
riches
and
honour
so
that
there
shall
not
be
any
among
the
kings
like
unto
thee
all
thy
days
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
as
thy
father
david
did
walk
then
i
will
lengthen
thy
days
and
solomon
awoke
and
behold
it
was
a
dream
and
he
came
to
jerusalem
and
stood
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
and
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
offered
peace
offerings
and
made
a
feast
to
all
his
servants
then
came
there
two
women
that
were
harlots
unto
the
king
and
stood
before
him
and
the
one
woman
said
o
my
lord
i
and
this
woman
dwell
in
one
house
and
i
was
delivered
of
a
child
with
her
in
the
house
and
it
came
to
pass
the
third
day
after
that
i
was
delivered
that
this
woman
was
delivered
also
and
we
were
together
there
was
no
stranger
with
us
in
the
house
save
we
two
in
the
house
and
this
woman's
child
died
in
the
night
because
she
overlaid
it
and
she
arose
at
midnight
and
took
my
son
from
beside
me
while
thine
handmaid
slept
and
laid
it
in
her
bosom
and
laid
her
dead
child
in
my
bosom
and
when
i
rose
in
the
morning
to
give
my
child
suck
behold
it
was
dead
but
when
i
had
considered
it
in
the
morning
behold
it
was
not
my
son
which
i
did
bear
and
the
other
woman
said
nay
but
the
living
is
my
son
and
the
dead
is
thy
son
and
this
said
no
but
the
dead
is
thy
son
and
the
living
is
my
son
thus
they
spake
before
the
king
then
said
the
king
the
one
saith
this
is
my
son
that
liveth
and
thy
son
is
the
dead
and
the
other
saith
nay
but
thy
son
is
the
dead
and
my
son
is
the
living
and
the
king
said
bring
me
a
sword
and
they
brought
a
sword
before
the
king
and
the
king
said
divide
the
living
child
in
two
and
give
half
to
the
one
and
half
to
the
other
then
spake
the
woman
whose
the
living
child
was
unto
the
king
for
her
bowels
yearned
upon
her
son
and
she
said
o
my
lord
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
no
wise
slay
it
but
the
other
said
let
it
be
neither
mine
nor
thine
but
divide
it
then
the
king
answered
and
said
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
no
wise
slay
it
she
is
the
mother
thereof
and
all
israel
heard
of
the
judgment
which
the
king
had
judged
and
they
feared
the
king
for
they
saw
that
the
wisdom
of
god
was
in
him
to
do
judgment

in
the
land
judah
and
israel
were
many
as
the
sand
which
is
by
the
sea
in
multitude
eating
and
drinking
and
making
merry
and
solomon
reigned
over
all
kingdoms
from
the
river
unto
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
unto
the
border
of
egypt
they
brought
presents
and
served
solomon
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
solomon's
provision
for
one
day
was
thirty
measures
of
fine
flour
and
threescore
measures
of
meal
ten
fat
oxen
and
twenty
oxen
out
of
the
pastures
and
an
hundred
sheep
beside
harts
and
roebucks
and
fallowdeer
and
fatted
fowl
for
he
had
dominion
over
all
the
region
on
this
side
the
river
from
tiphsah
even
to
azzah
over
all
the
kings
on
this
side
the
river
and
he
had
peace
on
all
sides
round
about
him
and
judah
and
israel
dwelt
safely
every
man
under
his
vine
and
under
his
fig
tree
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
all
the
days
of
solomon
and
solomon
had
forty
thousand
stalls
of
horses
for
his
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
and
those
officers
provided
victual
for
king
solomon
and
for
all
that
came
unto
king
solomon's
table
every
man
in
his
month
they
lacked
nothing
barley
also
and
straw
for
the
horses
and
dromedaries
brought
they
unto
the
place
where
the
officers
were
every
man
according
to
his
charge
and
god
gave
solomon
wisdom
and
understanding
exceeding
much
and
largeness
of
heart
even
as
the
sand
that
is
on
the
sea
shore
and
solomon's
wisdom
excelled
the
wisdom
of
all
the
children
of
the
east
country
and
all
the
wisdom
of
egypt
for
he
was
wiser
than
all
men
than
ethan
the
ezrahite
and
heman
and
chalcol
and
darda
the
sons
of
mahol
and
his
fame
was
in
all
nations
round
about
and
he
spake
three
thousand
proverbs
and
his
songs
were
a
thousand
and
five
and
he
spake
of
trees
from
the
cedar
tree
that
is
in
lebanon
even
unto
the
hyssop
that
springeth
out
of
the
wall
he
spake
also
of
beasts
and
of
fowl
and
of
creeping
things
and
of
fishes
and
there
came
of
all
people
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
solomon
from
all
kings
of
the
earth
which
had
heard
of
his
wisdom
and
hiram
king
of
tyre
sent
his
servants
unto
solomon
for
he
had
heard
that
they
had
anointed
him
king
in
the
room
of
his
father
for
hiram
was
ever
a
lover
of
david
and
solomon
sent
to
hiram
saying
thou
knowest
how
that
david
my
father
could
not
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
for
the
wars
which
were
about
him
on
every
side
until
the
lord
put
them
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
but
now
the
lord
my
god
hath
given
me
rest
on
every
side
so
that
there
is
neither
adversary
nor
evil
occurrent
and
behold
i
purpose
to
build
an
house
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
my
god
as
the
lord
spake
unto
david
my
father
saying
thy
son
whom
i
will
set
upon
thy
throne
in
thy
room
he
shall
build
an
house
unto
my
name
now
therefore
command
thou
that
they
hew
me
cedar
trees
out
of
lebanon
and
my
servants
shall
be
with
thy
servants
and
unto
thee
will
i
give
hire
for
thy
servants
according
to
all
that
thou
shalt
appoint
for
thou
knowest
that
there
is
not
among
us
any
that
can
skill
to
hew
timber
like
unto
the
sidonians
and
it
came
to
pass
when
hiram
heard
the
words
of
solomon
that
he
rejoiced
greatly
and
said
blessed
be
the
lord
this
day
which
hath
given
unto
david
a
wise
son
over
this
great
people
and
hiram
sent
to
solomon
saying
i
have
considered
the
things
which
thou
sentest
to
me
for
and
i
will
do
all
thy
desire
concerning
timber
of
cedar
and
concerning
timber
of
fir
my
servants
shall
bring
them
down
from
lebanon
unto
the
sea
and
i
will
convey
them
by
sea
in
floats
unto
the
place
that
thou
shalt
appoint
me
and
will
cause
them
to
be
discharged
there
and
thou
shalt
receive
them
and
thou
shalt
accomplish
my
desire
in
giving
food
for
my
household
so
hiram
gave
solomon
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
according
to
all
his
desire
and
solomon
gave
hiram
twenty
thousand
measures
of
wheat
for
food
to
his
household
and
twenty
measures
of
pure
oil
thus
gave
solomon
to
hiram
year
by
year
and
the
lord
gave
solomon
wisdom
as
he
promised
him
and
there
was
peace
between
hiram
and
solomon
and
they
two
made
a
league
together
and
king
solomon
raised
a
levy
out
of
all
israel
and
the
levy
was
thirty
thousand
men
and
he
sent
them
to
lebanon
ten
thousand
a
month
by
courses
a
month
they
were
in
lebanon
and
two
months
at
home
and
adoniram
was
over
the
levy
and
solomon
had
threescore
and
ten
thousand
that
bare
burdens
and
fourscore
thousand
hewers
in
the
mountains
beside
the
chief
of
solomon's
officers
which
were
over
the
work
three
thousand
and
three
hundred
which
ruled
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work
and
the
king
commanded
and
they
brought
great
stones
costly
stones
and
hewed
stones
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
house
and
solomon's
builders
and
hiram's
builders
did
hew
them
and
the
stonesquarers
so
they
prepared
timber
and
stones
to
build
the
house
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
four
hundred
and
eightieth
year
after
the
children
of
israel
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
fourth
year
of
solomon's
reign
over
israel
in
the
month
zif
which
is
the
second
month
that
he
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
house
which
king
solomon
built
for
the
lord
the
length
thereof
was
threescore
cubits
and
the
breadth
thereof
twenty
cubits
and
the
height
thereof
thirty
cubits
and
the
porch
before
the
temple
of
the
house
twenty
cubits
was
the
length
thereof
according
to
the
breadth
of
the
house
and
ten
cubits
was
the
breadth
thereof
before
the
house
and
for
the
house
he
made
windows
of
narrow
lights
and
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
built
chambers
round
about
against
the
walls
of
the
house
round
about
both
of
the
temple
and
of
the
oracle
and
he
made
chambers
round
about
the
nethermost
chamber
was
five
cubits
broad
and
the
middle
was
six
cubits
broad
and
the
third
was
seven
cubits
broad
for
without
in
the
wall
of
the
house
he
made
narrowed
rests
round
about
that
the
beams
should
not
be
fastened
in
the
walls
of
the
house
and
the
house
when
it
was
in
building
was
built
of
stone
made
ready
before
it
was
brought
thither
so
that
there
was
neither
hammer
nor
axe
nor
any
tool
of
iron
heard
in
the
house
while
it
was
in
building
the
door
for
the
middle
chamber
was
in
the
right
side
of
the
house
and
they
went
up
with
winding
stairs
into
the
middle
chamber
and
out
of
the
middle
into
the
third
so
he
built
the
house
and
finished
it
and
covered
the
house
with
beams
and
boards
of
cedar
and
then
he
built
chambers
against
all
the
house
five
cubits
high
and
they
rested
on
the
house
with
timber
of
cedar
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
solomon
saying
concerning
this
house
which
thou
art
in
building
if
thou
wilt
walk
in
my
statutes
and
execute
my
judgments
and
keep
all
my
commandments
to
walk
in
them
then
will
i
perform
my
word
with
thee
which
i
spake
unto
david
thy
father
and
i
will
dwell
among
the
children
of
israel
and
will
not
forsake
my
people
israel
so
solomon
built
the
house
and
finished
it
and
he
built
the
walls
of
the
house
within
with
boards
of
cedar
both

floor
of
the
house
and
the

of
the

and
he
covered
them
on
the
inside
with
wood
and
covered
the
floor
of
the
house
with
planks
of

he
built
twenty
cubits
on
the
sides
of
the
house
both
the
floor
and
the
walls
with
boards
of
cedar
he
even
built
them
for
it
within
even
for
the
oracle
even
for
the
most
holy
place
and
the
house
that
is
the
temple
before

was
forty

and
the
cedar
of
the
house
within
was
carved
with
knops
and
open
flowers
all
was
cedar
there
was
no
stone
seen
and
the
oracle
he
prepared
in
the
house
within

of
the
lord
and

the
forepart
was
twenty

and
twenty

in
breadth
and
twenty

in
the
height
thereof
and
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
and
so
covered
the
altar
which
was
of
cedar
so
solomon
overlaid
the
house
within
with
pure
gold
and
he
made
a
partition
by
the
chains
of
gold
before
the
oracle

one
size

height
of
the
one
cherub
was

cubits
and
so
was
it
of
the
other
cherub
and
he
set
the
cherubims
within
the
inner
house
and
they
stretched
forth
the
wings
of
the
cherubims
so
that
the
wing
of
the
one
touched
the
one
wall
and
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub
touched
the
other
wall
and
their
wings
touched
one

overlaid
with
gold

and
for
the

he
made

lintel
and

were
a
fifth
part
of
the
wall
the
two
doors

wrought
like
the
brim
of
a
cup
with
flowers
of
lilies
it
contained
two
thousand
baths
and
he
made
ten
bases
of
brass
four
cubits
was
the
length
of
one
base
and
four
cubits
the
breadth
thereof
and
three
cubits
the
height
of
it
and
the
work
of
the
bases
was
on
this
manner
they
had
borders
and
the
borders
were
between
the
ledges
and
on
the
borders
that
were
between
the
ledges
were
lions
oxen
and
cherubims
and
upon
the
ledges
there
was
a
base
above
and
beneath
the
lions
and
oxen
were
certain
additions
made
of
thin
work
and
every
base
had
four
brasen
wheels
and
plates
of
brass
and
the
four
corners
thereof
had
undersetters
under
the
laver
were
undersetters
molten
at
the
side
of
every
addition
and
the
mouth
of
it
within
the
chapiter
and
above
was
a
cubit
but
the
mouth
thereof
was
round
after
the
work
of
the
base
a
cubit
and
an
half
and
also
upon
the
mouth
of
it
were
gravings
with
their
borders
foursquare
not
round
and
under
the
borders
were
four
wheels
and
the
axletrees
of
the
wheels
were
joined
to
the
base
and
the
height
of
a
wheel
was
a
cubit
and
half
a
cubit
and
the
work
of
the
wheels
was
like
the
work
of
a
chariot
wheel
their
axletrees
and
their
naves
and
their
felloes
and
their
spokes
were
all
molten
and
there
were
four
undersetters
to
the
four
corners
of
one
base
and
the
undersetters
were
of
the
very
base
itself
and
in
the
top
of
the
base
was
there
a
round
compass
of
half
a
cubit
high
and
on
the
top
of
the
base
the
ledges
thereof
and
the
borders
thereof
were
of
the
same
for
on
the
plates
of
the
ledges
thereof
and
on
the
borders
thereof
he
graved
cherubims
lions
and
palm
trees
according
to
the
proportion
of
every
one
and
additions
round
about
after
this
manner
he
made
the
ten
bases
all
of
them
had
one
casting
one
measure
and
one
size
then
made
he
ten
lavers
of
brass
one
laver
contained
forty
baths
and
every
laver
was
four
cubits
and
upon
every
one
of
the
ten
bases
one
laver
and
he
put
five
bases
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
and
five
on
the
left
side
of
the
house
and
he
set
the
sea
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
eastward
over
against
the
south
and
hiram
made
the
lavers
and
the
shovels
and
the
basons
so
hiram
made
an
end
of
doing
all
the
work
that
he
made
king
solomon
for
the
house
of
the
lord
the
two
pillars
and
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
two
pillars
and
the
two
networks
to
cover
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
which
were
upon
the
top
of
the
pillars
and
four
hundred
pomegranates
for
the
two
networks
even
two
rows
of
pomegranates
for
one
network
to
cover
the
two
bowls
of
the
chapiters
that
were
upon
the
pillars
and
the
ten
bases
and
ten
lavers
on
the
bases
and
one
sea
and
twelve
oxen
under
the
sea
and
the
pots
and
the
shovels
and
the
basons
and
all
these
vessels
which
hiram
made
to
king
solomon
for
the
house
of
the
lord
were
of
bright
brass
in
the
plain
of
jordan
did
the
king
cast
them
in
the
clay
ground
between
succoth
and
zarthan
and
solomon
left
all
the
vessels
unweighed
because
they
were
exceeding
many
neither
was
the
weight
of
the
brass
found
out
and
solomon
made
all
the
vessels
that
pertained
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
the
altar
of
gold
and
the
table
of
gold
whereupon
the
shewbread
was
and
the
candlesticks
of
pure
gold
five
on
the
right
side
and
five
on
the
left
before
the
oracle
with
the
flowers
and
the
lamps
and
the
tongs
of
gold
and
the
bowls
and
the
snuffers
and
the
basons
and
the
spoons
and
the
censers
of
pure
gold
and
the
hinges
of
gold
both
for
the
doors
of
the
inner
house
the
most
holy
place
and
for
the
doors
of
the
house
to
wit
of
the
temple
so
was
ended
all
the
work
that
king
solomon
made
for
the
house
of
the
lord
and
solomon
brought
in
the
things
which
david
his
father
had
dedicated
even
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
vessels
did
he
put
among
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
then
solomon
assembled
the
elders
of
israel
and
all
the
heads
of
the
tribes
the
chief
of
the
fathers
of
the
children
of
israel
unto
king
solomon
in
jerusalem
that
they
might
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
out
of
the
city
of
david
which
is
zion
and
all
the
men
of
israel
assembled
themselves
unto
king
solomon
at
the
feast
in
the
month
ethanim
which
is
the
seventh
month
and
all
the
elders
of
israel
came
and
the
priests
took
up
the
ark
and
they
brought
up
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
the
tabernacle
of
the
congregation
and
all
the
holy
vessels
that
were
in
the
tabernacle
even
those
did
the
priests
and
the
levites
bring
up
and
king
solomon
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
that
were
assembled
unto
him
were
with
him
before
the
ark
sacrificing
sheep
and
oxen
that
could
not
be
told
nor
numbered
for
multitude
and
the
priests
brought
in
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
unto
his
place
into
the
oracle
of
the
house
to
the
most
holy
place
even
under
the
wings
of
the
cherubims
for
the
cherubims
spread
forth
their
two
wings
over
the
place
of
the
ark
and
the
cherubims
covered
the
ark
and
the
staves
thereof
above
and
they
drew
out
the
staves
that
the
ends
of
the
staves
were
seen
out
in
the
holy
place
before
the
oracle
and
they
were
not
seen
without
and
there
they
are
unto
this
day
there
was
nothing
in
the
ark
save
the
two
tables
of
stone
which
moses
put
there
at
horeb
when
the
lord
made
a
covenant
with
the
children
of
israel
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
priests
were
come
out
of
the
holy
place
that
the
cloud
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
so
that
the
priests
could
not
stand
to
minister
because
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
had
filled
the
house
of
the
lord
then
spake
solomon
the
lord
said
that
he
would
dwell
in
the
thick
darkness
i
have
surely
built
thee
an
house
to
dwell
in
a
settled
place
for
thee
to
abide
in
for
ever
and
the
king
turned
his
face
about
and
blessed
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
stood
and
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
spake
with
his
mouth
unto
david
my
father
and
hath
with
his
hand
fulfilled
it
saying
since
the
day
that
i
brought
forth
my
people
israel
out
of
egypt
i
chose
no
city
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
build
an
house
that
my
name
might
be
therein
but
i
chose
david
to
be
over
my
people
israel
and
it
was
in
the
heart
of
david
my
father
to
build
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
the
lord
said
unto
david
my
father
whereas
it
was
in
thine
heart
to
build
an
house
unto
my
name
thou
didst
well
that
it
was
in
thine
heart
nevertheless
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
but
thy
son
that
shall
come
forth
out
of
thy
loins
he
shall
build
the
house
unto
my
name
and
the
lord
hath
performed
his
word
that
he
spake
and
i
am
risen
up
in
the
room
of
david
my
father
and
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
as
the
lord
promised
and
have
built
an
house
for
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
and
i
have
set
there
a
place
for
the
ark
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
the
lord
which
he
made
with
our
fathers
when
he
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
solomon
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
heaven
and
he
said
lord
god
of
israel
there
is
no
god
like
thee
in
heaven
above
or
on
earth
beneath
who
keepest
covenant
and
mercy
with
thy
servants
that
walk
before
thee
with
all
their
heart
who
hast
kept
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
thou
promisedst
him
thou
spakest
also
with
thy
mouth
and
hast
fulfilled
it
with
thine
hand
as
it
is
this
day
therefore
now
lord
god
of
israel
keep
with
thy
servant
david
my
father
that
thou
promisedst
him
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
in
my
sight
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
so
that
thy
children
take
heed
to
their
way
that
they
walk
before
me
as
thou
hast
walked
before
me
and
now
o
god
of
israel
let
thy
word
i
pray
thee
be
verified
which
thou
spakest
unto
thy
servant
david
my
father
but
will
god
indeed
dwell
on
the
earth
behold
the
heaven
and
heaven
of
heavens
cannot
contain
thee
how
much
less
this
house
that
i
have
builded
yet
have
thou
respect
unto
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
his
supplication
o
lord
my
god
to
hearken
unto
the
cry
and
to
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
prayeth
before
thee
to
day
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
toward
this
house
night
and
day
even
toward
the
place
of
which
thou
hast
said
my
name
shall
be
there
that
thou
mayest
hearken
unto
the
prayer
which
thy
servant
shall
make
toward
this
place
and
hearken
thou
to
the
supplication
of
thy
servant
and
of
thy
people
israel
when
they
shall
pray
toward
this
place
and
hear
thou
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
when
thou
hearest
forgive
if
any
man
trespass
against
his
neighbour
and
an
oath
be
laid
upon
him
to
cause
him
to
swear
and
the
oath
come
before
thine
altar
in
this
house
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
do
and
judge
thy
servants
condemning
the
wicked
to
bring
his
way
upon
his
head
and
justifying
the
righteous
to
give
him
according
to
his
righteousness
when
thy
people
israel
be
smitten
down
before
the
enemy
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
and
shall
turn
again
to
thee
and
confess
thy
name
and
pray
and
make
supplication
unto
thee
in
this
house
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
people
israel
and
bring
them
again
unto
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
when
heaven
is
shut
up
and
there
is
no
rain
because
they
have
sinned
against
thee
if
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
confess
thy
name
and
turn
from
their
sin
when
thou
afflictest
them
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
and
forgive
the
sin
of
thy
servants
and
of
thy
people
israel
that
thou
teach
them
the
good
way
wherein
they
should
walk
and
give
rain
upon
thy
land
which
thou
hast
given
to
thy
people
for
an
inheritance
if
there
be
in
the
land
famine
if
there
be
pestilence
blasting
mildew

or
if
there
be

if
their
enemy
besiege
them
in

cities
whatsoever
plague
whatsoever
sickness
there
be
what
prayer
and
supplication
soever
be
made
by
any
man
or
by
all
thy
people
israel
which
shall
know
every
man
the
plague
of
his
own
heart
and
spread
forth
his
hands
toward
this
house
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
forgive
and
do
and
give
to
every
man
according
to
his
ways
whose

of
all
the

of
men
that
they
may
fear
thee
all
the
days
that
they
live
in
the
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
our
fathers
moreover
concerning
a
stranger
that
is
not
of
thy
people
israel
but
cometh
out
of
a
far
country
for
thy
name's
sake
for
they
shall
hear
of
thy
great
name
and
of
thy
strong

and
of
thy
stretched

thee
as
do
thy
people
israel
and
that
they
may
know
that
this
house
which
i
have
builded
is
called
by
thy
name
if
thy
people
go
out
to
battle
against
their
enemy
whithersoever
thou
shalt
send
them
and
shall
pray
unto
the
lord
toward
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
toward
the
house
that
i
have
built
for
thy
name
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
and
maintain
their
cause
if
they
sin
against
thee
for
there
is
no
man
that
sinneth
not
and
thou
be
angry
with
them
and
deliver
them
to
the
enemy
so
that
they
carry
them
away
captives
unto
the
land
of
the
enemy
far
or
near
yet
if
they
shall
bethink
themselves
in
the
land
whither
they
were
carried
captives
and
repent
and
make
supplication
unto
thee
in
the
land
of
them
that
carried
them
captives
saying
we
have
sinned
and
have
done
perversely
we
have
committed
wickedness
and
so
return
unto
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
which
led
them
away
captive
and
pray
unto
thee
toward
their
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
the
house
which
i
have
built
for
thy
name
then
hear
thou
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
in
heaven
thy
dwelling
place
and
maintain
their
cause
and
forgive
thy
people
that
have
sinned
against
thee
and
all
their
transgressions
wherein
they
have
transgressed
against
thee
and
give
them
compassion
before
them
who
carried
them
captive
that
they
may
have
compassion
on
them
for
they
be
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
broughtest
forth
out
of
egypt
from
the
midst
of
the
furnace
of
iron
that
thine
eyes
may
be
open
unto
the
supplication
of
thy
servant
and
unto
the
supplication
of
thy
people
israel
to
hearken
unto
them
in
all
that
they
call
for
unto
thee
for
thou
didst
separate
them
from
among
all
the
people
of
the
earth
to
be
thine
inheritance
as
thou
spakest
by
the
hand
of
moses
thy
servant
when
thou
broughtest
our
fathers
out
of
egypt
o
lord
god
and
it
was
so
that
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
all
this
prayer
and
supplication
unto
the
lord
he
arose
from
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
from
kneeling
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
spread
up
to
heaven
and
he
stood
and
blessed
all
the
congregation
of
israel
with
a
loud
voice
saying
blessed
be
the
lord
that
hath
given
rest
unto
his
people
israel
according
to
all
that
he
promised
there
hath
not
failed
one
word
of
all
his
good
promise
which
he
promised
by
the
hand
of
moses
his
servant
the
lord
our
god
be
with
us
as
he
was
with
our
fathers
let
him
not
leave
us
nor
forsake
us
that
he
may
incline
our
hearts
unto
him
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
which
he
commanded
our
fathers
and
let
these
my
words
wherewith
i
have
made
supplication
before
the
lord
be
nigh
unto
the
lord
our
god
day
and
night
that
he
maintain
the
cause
of
his
servant
and
the
cause
of
his
people
israel
at
all
times
as
the
matter
shall
require
that
all
the
people
of
the
earth
may
know
that
the
lord
is
god
and
that
there
is
none
else
let
your
heart
therefore
be
perfect
with
the
lord
our
god
to
walk
in
his
statutes
and
to
keep
his
commandments
as
at
this
day
and
the
king
and
all
israel
with
him
offered
sacrifice
before
the
lord
and
solomon
offered
a
sacrifice
of
peace
offerings
which
he
offered
unto
the
lord
two
and
twenty
thousand
oxen
and
an
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
sheep
so
the
king
and
all
the
children
of
israel
dedicated
the
house
of
the
lord
the
same
day
did
the
king
hallow
the
middle
of
the
court
that
was
before
the
house
of
the
lord
for
there
he
offered
burnt
offerings
and
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
because
the
brasen
altar
that
was
before
the
lord
was
too
little
to
receive
the
burnt
offerings
and
meat
offerings
and
the
fat
of
the
peace
offerings
and
at
that
time
solomon
held
a
feast
and
all
israel
with
him
a
great
congregation
from
the
entering
in
of
hamath
unto
the
river
of
egypt
before
the
lord
our
god
seven
days
and
seven
days
even
fourteen
days
on
the
eighth
day
he
sent
the
people
away
and
they
blessed
the
king
and
went
unto
their
tents
joyful
and
glad
of
heart
for
all
the
goodness
that
the
lord
had
done
for
david
his
servant
and
for
israel
his
people
and
it
came
to
pass
when
solomon
had
finished
the
building
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king's
house
and
all
solomon's
desire
which
he
was
pleased
to
do
that
the
lord
appeared
to
solomon
the
second
time
as
he
had
appeared
unto
him
at
gibeon
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
david
thy
father
walked
in
integrity
of
heart
and
in
uprightness
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
wilt
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
then
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
as
i
promised
to
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
upon
the
throne
of
israel
but
if
ye
shall
at
all
turn
from
following
me
ye
or
your
children
and
will
not
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
which
i
have
set
before
you
but
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
then
will
i
cut
off
israel
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
hallowed
for
my
name
will
i
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
israel
shall
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
people
and
at
this
house
which
is
high
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished
and
shall
hiss
and
they
shall
say
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
to
this
house
and
they
shall
answer
because
they
forsook
the
lord
their
god
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
have
taken
hold
upon
other
gods
and
have
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
the
lord
brought
upon
them
all
this
evil
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
when
solomon
had
built
the
two
houses
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king's
house
now
hiram
the
king
of
tyre
had
furnished
solomon
with
cedar
trees
and
fir
trees
and
with
gold
according
to
all
his
desire
that
then
king
solomon
gave
hiram
twenty
cities
in
the
land
of
galilee
and
hiram
came
out
from
tyre
to
see
the
cities
which
solomon
had
given
him
and
they
pleased
him
not
and
he
said
what
cities
are
these
which
thou
hast
given
me
my
brother
and
he
called
them
the
land
of
cabul
unto
this
day
and
hiram
sent
to
the
king
sixscore
talents
of
gold
and
this
is
the
reason
of
the
levy
which
king
solomon
raised
for
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
and
his
own
house
and
millo
and
the
wall
of
jerusalem
and
hazor
and
megiddo
and
gezer
for
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
had
gone
up
and
taken
gezer
and
burnt
it
with
fire
and
slain
the
canaanites
that
dwelt
in
the
city
and
given
it
for
a
present
unto
his
daughter
solomon's
wife
and
solomon
built
gezer
and
bethhoron
the
nether
and
baalath
and
tadmor
in
the
wilderness
in
the
land
and
all
the
cities
of
store
that
solomon
had
and
cities
for
his
chariots
and
cities
for
his
horsemen
and
that
which
solomon
desired
to
build
in
jerusalem
and
in
lebanon
and
in
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
and
all
the
people
that
were
left
of
the
amorites
hittites
perizzites
hivites
and
jebusites
which
were
not
of
the
children
of
israel
their
children
that
were
left
after
them
in
the
land
whom
the
children
of
israel
also
were
not
able
utterly
to
destroy
upon
those
did
solomon
levy
a
tribute
of
bondservice
unto
this
day
but
of
the
children
of
israel
did
solomon
make
no
bondmen
but
they
were
men
of
war
and
his
servants
and
his
princes
and
his
captains
and
rulers
of
his
chariots
and
his
horsemen
these
were
the
chief
of
the
officers
that
were
over
solomon's
work
five
hundred
and
fifty
which
bare
rule
over
the
people
that
wrought
in
the
work
but
pharaoh's
daughter
came
up
out
of
the
city
of
david
unto
her
house
which
solomon
had
built
for
her
then
did
he
build
millo
and
three
times
in
a
year
did
solomon
offer
burnt
offerings
and
peace
offerings
upon
the
altar
which
he
built
unto
the
lord
and
he
burnt
incense
upon
the
altar
that
was
before
the
lord
so
he
finished
the
house
and
king
solomon
made
a
navy
of
ships
in
eziongeber
which
is
beside
eloth
on
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
in
the
land
of
edom
and
hiram
sent
in
the
navy
his
servants
shipmen
that
had
knowledge
of
the
sea
with
the
servants
of
solomon
and
they
came
to
ophir
and
fetched
from
thence
gold
four
hundred
and
twenty
talents
and
brought
it
to
king
solomon
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
heard
of
the
fame
of
solomon
concerning
the
name
of
the
lord
she
came
to
prove
him
with
hard
questions
and
she
came
to
jerusalem
with
a
very
great
train
with
camels
that
bare
spices
and
very
much
gold
and
precious
stones
and
when
she
was
come
to
solomon
she
communed
with
him
of
all
that
was
in
her
heart
and
solomon
told
her
all
her
questions
there
was
not
any
thing
hid
from
the
king
which
he
told
her
not
and
when
the
queen
of
sheba
had
seen
all
solomon's
wisdom
and
the
house
that
he
had
built
and
the
meat
of
his
table
and
the
sitting
of
his
servants
and
the
attendance
of
his
ministers
and
their
apparel
and
his
cupbearers
and
his
ascent
by
which
he
went
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
there
was
no
more
spirit
in
her
and
she
said
to
the
king
it
was
a
true
report
that
i
heard
in
mine
own
land
of
thy
acts
and
of
thy
wisdom
howbeit
i
believed
not
the
words
until
i
came
and
mine
eyes
had
seen
it
and
behold
the
half
was
not
told
me
thy
wisdom
and
prosperity
exceedeth
the
fame
which
i
heard
happy
are
thy
men
happy
are
these
thy
servants
which
stand
continually
before
thee
and
that
hear
thy
wisdom
blessed
be
the
lord
thy
god
which
delighted
in
thee
to
set
thee
on
the
throne
of
israel
because
the
lord
loved
israel
for
ever
therefore
made
he
thee
king
to
do
judgment
and
justice
and
she
gave
the
king
an
hundred
and
twenty
talents
of
gold
and
of
spices
very
great
store
and
precious
stones
there
came
no
more
such
abundance
of
spices
as
these
which
the
queen
of
sheba
gave
to
king
solomon
and
the
navy
also
of
hiram
that
brought
gold
from
ophir
brought
in
from
ophir
great
plenty
of
almug
trees
and
precious
stones
and
the
king
made
of
the
almug
trees
pillars
for
the
house
of
the
lord
and
for
the
king's
house
harps
also
and
psalteries
for
singers
there
came
no
such
almug
trees
nor
were
seen
unto
this
day
and
king
solomon
gave
unto
the
queen
of
sheba
all
her
desire
whatsoever
she
asked
beside
that
which
solomon
gave
her
of
his
royal
bounty
so
she
turned
and
went
to
her
own
country
she
and
her
servants
now
the
weight
of
gold
that
came
to
solomon
in
one
year
was
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
talents
of
gold
beside
that
he
had
of
the
merchantmen
and
of
the
traffick
of
the
spice
merchants
and
of
all
the
kings
of
arabia
and
of
the
governors
of
the
country
and
king
solomon
made
two
hundred
targets
of
beaten
gold
six
hundred
shekels
of
gold
went
to
one
target
and
he
made
three
hundred
shields
of
beaten
gold
three
pound
of
gold
went
to
one
shield
and
the
king
put
them
in
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
moreover
the
king
made
a
great
throne
of
ivory
and
overlaid
it
with
the
best
gold
the
throne
had
six
steps
and
the
top
of
the
throne
was
round
behind
and
there
were
stays
on
either
side
on
the
place
of
the
seat
and
two
lions
stood
beside
the
stays
and
twelve
lions
stood
there
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
upon
the
six
steps
there
was
not
the
like
made
in
any
kingdom
and
all
king
solomon's
drinking
vessels
were
of
gold
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
were
of
pure
gold
none
were
of
silver
it
was
nothing
accounted
of
in
the
days
of
solomon
for
the
king
had
at
sea
a
navy
of
tharshish
with
the
navy
of
hiram
once
in
three
years
came
the
navy
of
tharshish
bringing
gold
and
silver
ivory
and
apes
and
peacocks
so
king
solomon
exceeded
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
for
riches
and
for
wisdom
and
all
the
earth
sought
to
solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
which
god
had
put
in
his
heart
and
they
brought
every
man
his
present
vessels
of
silver
and
vessels
of
gold
and
garments
and
armour
and
spices
horses
and
mules
a
rate
year
by
year
and
solomon
gathered
together
chariots
and
horsemen
and
he
had
a
thousand
and
four
hundred
chariots
and
twelve
thousand
horsemen
whom
he
bestowed
in
the
cities
for
chariots
and
with
the
king
at
jerusalem
and
the
king
made
silver
to
be
in
jerusalem
as
stones
and
cedars
made
he
to
be
as
the
sycomore
trees
that
are
in
the
vale
for
abundance
and
solomon
had
horses
brought
out
of
egypt
and
linen
yarn
the
king's
merchants
received
the
linen
yarn
at
a
price
and
a
chariot
came
up
and
went
out
of
egypt
for
six
hundred
shekels
of
silver
and
an
horse
for
an
hundred
and
fifty
and
so
for
all
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
for
the
kings
of
syria
did
they
bring
them
out
by
their
means
but
king
solomon
loved
many
strange
women
together
with
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
women
of
the
moabites
ammonites
edomites
zidonians
and
hittites
of
the
nations
concerning
which
the
lord
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
ye
shall
not
go
in
to
them
neither
shall
they
come
in
unto
you
for
surely
they
will
turn
away
your
heart
after
their
gods
solomon
clave
unto
these
in
love
and
he
had
seven
hundred
wives
princesses
and
three
hundred
concubines
and
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
for
it
came
to
pass
when
solomon
was
old
that
his
wives
turned
away
his
heart
after
other
gods
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
the
lord
his
god
as
was
the
heart
of
david
his
father
for
solomon
went
after
ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
zidonians
and
after
milcom
the
abomination
of
the
ammonites
and
solomon
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
went
not
fully
after
the
lord
as
did
david
his
father
then
did
solomon
build
an
high
place
for
chemosh
the
abomination
of
moab
in
the
hill
that
is
before
jerusalem
and
for
molech
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
likewise
did
he
for
all
his
strange
wives
which
burnt
incense
and
sacrificed
unto
their
gods
and
the
lord
was
angry
with
solomon
because
his
heart
was
turned
from
the
lord
god
of
israel
which
had
appeared
unto
him
twice
and
had
commanded
him
concerning
this
thing
that
he
should
not
go
after
other
gods
but
he
kept
not
that
which
the
lord
commanded
wherefore
the
lord
said
unto
solomon
forasmuch
as
this
is
done
of
thee
and
thou
hast
not
kept
my
covenant
and
my
statutes
which
i
have
commanded
thee
i
will
surely
rend
the
kingdom
from
thee
and
will
give
it
to
thy
servant
notwithstanding
in
thy
days
i
will
not
do
it
for
david
thy
father's
sake
but
i
will
rend
it
out
of
the
hand
of
thy
son
howbeit
i
will
not
rend
away
all
the
kingdom
but
will
give
one
tribe
to
thy
son
for
david
my
servant's
sake
and
for
jerusalem's
sake
which
i
have
chosen
and
the
lord
stirred
up
an
adversary
unto
solomon
hadad
the
edomite
he
was
of
the
king's
seed
in
edom
for
it
came
to
pass
when
david
was
in
edom
and
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
gone
up
to
bury
the
slain
after
he
had
smitten
every
male
in
edom
for
six
months
did
joab
remain
there
with
all
israel
until
he
had
cut
off
every
male
in
edom
that
hadad
fled
he
and
certain
edomites
of
his
father's
servants
with
him
to
go
into
egypt
hadad
being
yet
a
little
child
and
they
arose
out
of
midian
and
came
to
paran
and
they
took
men
with
them
out
of
paran
and
they
came
to
egypt
unto
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
which
gave
him
an
house
and
appointed
him
victuals
and
gave
him
land
and
hadad
found
great
favour
in
the
sight
of
pharaoh
so
that
he
gave
him
to
wife
the
sister
of
his
own
wife
the
sister
of
tahpenes
the
queen
and
the
sister
of
tahpenes
bare
him
genubath
his
son
whom
tahpenes
weaned
in
pharaoh's
house
and
genubath
was
in
pharaoh's
household
among
the
sons
of
pharaoh
and
when
hadad
heard
in
egypt
that
david
slept
with
his
fathers
and
that
joab
the
captain
of
the
host
was
dead
hadad
said
to
pharaoh
let
me
depart
that
i
may
go
to
mine
own
country
then
pharaoh
said
unto
him
but
what
hast
thou
lacked
with
me
that
behold
thou
seekest
to
go
to
thine
own
country
and
he
answered
nothing
howbeit
let
me
go
in
any
wise
and
god
stirred
him
up
another
adversary
rezon
the
son
of
eliadah
which
fled
from
his
lord
hadadezer
king
of
zobah
and
he
gathered
men
unto
him
and
became
captain
over
a
band
when
david
slew
them
of
zobah
and
they
went
to
damascus
and
dwelt
therein
and
reigned
in
damascus
and
he
was
an
adversary
to
israel
all
the
days
of
solomon
beside
the
mischief
that
hadad
did
and
he
abhorred
israel
and
reigned
over
syria
and
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
an
ephrathite
of
zereda
solomon's
servant
whose
mother's
name
was
zeruah
a
widow
woman
even
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
and
this
was
the
cause
that
he
lifted
up
his
hand
against
the
king
solomon
built
millo
and
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
the
man
jeroboam
was
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
solomon
seeing
the
young
man
that
he
was
industrious
he
made
him
ruler
over
all
the
charge
of
the
house
of
joseph
and
it
came
to
pass
at
that
time
when
jeroboam
went
out
of
jerusalem
that
the
prophet
ahijah
the
shilonite
found
him
in
the
way
and
he
had
clad
himself
with
a
new
garment
and
they
two
were
alone
in
the
field
and
ahijah
caught
the
new
garment
that
was
on
him
and
rent
it
in
twelve
pieces
and
he
said
to
jeroboam
take
thee
ten
pieces
for
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
behold
i
will
rend
the
kingdom
out
of
the
hand
of
solomon
and
will
give
ten
tribes
to
thee
but
he
shall
have
one
tribe
for
my
servant
david's
sake
and
for
jerusalem's
sake
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
because
that
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
worshipped
ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
zidonians
chemosh
the
god
of
the
moabites
and
milcom
the
god
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
have
not
walked
in
my
ways
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
mine
eyes
and
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
as
did
david
his
father
howbeit
i
will
not
take
the
whole
kingdom
out
of
his
hand
but
i
will
make
him
prince
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
david
my
servant's
sake
whom
i
chose
because
he
kept
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
but
i
will
take
the
kingdom
out
of
his
son's
hand
and
will
give
it
unto
thee
even
ten
tribes
and
unto
his
son
will
i
give
one
tribe
that
david
my
servant
may
have
a
light
alway
before
me
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
me
to
put
my
name
there
and
i
will
take
thee
and
thou
shalt
reign
according
to
all
that
thy
soul
desireth
and
shalt
be
king
over
israel
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
all
that
i
command
thee
and
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
and
do
that
is
right
in
my
sight
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
as
david
my
servant
did
that
i
will
be
with
thee
and
build
thee
a
sure
house
as
i
built
for
david
and
will
give
israel
unto
thee
and
i
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
david
but
not
for
ever
solomon
sought
therefore
to
kill
jeroboam
and
jeroboam
arose
and
fled
into
egypt
unto
shishak
king
of
egypt
and
was
in
egypt
until
the
death
of
solomon
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
solomon
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
wisdom
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
acts
of
solomon
and
the
time
that
solomon
reigned
in
jerusalem
over
all
israel
was
forty
years
and
solomon
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
rehoboam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
rehoboam
went
to
shechem
for
all
israel
were
come
to
shechem
to
make
him
king
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
was
yet
in
egypt
heard
of
it
for
he
was
fled
from
the
presence
of
king
solomon
and
jeroboam
dwelt
in
egypt
that
they
sent
and
called
him
and
jeroboam
and
all
the
congregation
of
israel
came
and
spake
unto
rehoboam
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
grievous
now
therefore
make
thou
the
grievous
service
of
thy
father
and
his
heavy
yoke
which
he
put
upon
us
lighter
and
we
will
serve
thee
and
he
said
unto
them
depart
yet
for
three
days
then
come
again
to
me
and
the
people
departed
and
king
rehoboam
consulted
with
the
old
men
that
stood
before
solomon
his
father
while
he
yet
lived
and
said
how
do
ye
advise
that
i
may
answer
this
people
and
they
spake
unto
him
saying
if
thou
wilt
be
a
servant
unto
this
people
this
day
and
wilt
serve
them
and
answer
them
and
speak
good
words
to
them
then
they
will
be
thy
servants
for
ever
but
he
forsook
the
counsel
of
the
old
men
which
they
had
given
him
and
consulted
with
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
and
which
stood
before
him
and
he
said
unto
them
what
counsel
give
ye
that
we
may
answer
this
people
who
have
spoken
to
me
saying
make
the
yoke
which
thy
father
did
put
upon
us
lighter
and
the
young
men
that
were
grown
up
with
him
spake
unto
him
saying
thus
shalt
thou
speak
unto
this
people
that
spake
unto
thee
saying
thy
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
make
thou
it
lighter
unto
us
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
them
my
little
finger
shall
be
thicker
than
my
father's
loins
and
now
whereas
my
father
did
lade
you
with
a
heavy
yoke
i
will
add
to
your
yoke
my
father
hath
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
so
jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
rehoboam
the
third
day
as
the
king
had
appointed
saying
come
to
me
again
the
third
day
and
the
king
answered
the
people
roughly
and
forsook
the
old
men's
counsel
that
they
gave
him
and
spake
to
them
after
the
counsel
of
the
young
men
saying
my
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
and
i
will
add
to
your
yoke
my
father
also
chastised
you
with
whips
but
i
will
chastise
you
with
scorpions
wherefore
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
the
people
for
the
cause
was
from
the
lord
that
he
might
perform
his
saying
which
the
lord
spake
by
ahijah
the
shilonite
unto
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
so
when
all
israel
saw
that
the
king
hearkened
not
unto
them
the
people
answered
the
king
saying
what
portion
have
we
in
david
neither
have
we
inheritance
in
the
son
of
jesse
to
your
tents
o
israel
now
see
to
thine
own
house
david
so
israel
departed
unto
their
tents
but
as
for
the
children
of
israel
which
dwelt
in
the
cities
of
judah
rehoboam
reigned
over
them
then
king
rehoboam
sent
adoram
who
was
over
the
tribute
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
therefore
king
rehoboam
made
speed
to
get
him
up
to
his
chariot
to
flee
to
jerusalem
so
israel
rebelled
against
the
house
of
david
unto
this
day
and
it
came
to
pass
when
all
israel
heard
that
jeroboam
was
come
again
that
they
sent
and
called
him
unto
the
congregation
and
made
him
king
over
all
israel
there
was
none
that
followed
the
house
of
david
but
the
tribe
of
judah
only
and
when
rehoboam
was
come
to
jerusalem
he
assembled
all
the
house
of
judah
with
the
tribe
of
benjamin
an
hundred
and
fourscore
thousand
chosen
men
which
were
warriors
to
fight
against
the
house
of
israel
to
bring
the
kingdom
again
to
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
but
the
word
of
god
came
unto
shemaiah
the
man
of
god
saying
speak
unto
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
king
of
judah
and
unto
all
the
house
of
judah
and
benjamin
and
to
the
remnant
of
the
people
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
go
up
nor
fight
against
your
brethren
the
children
of
israel
return
every
man
to
his
house
for
this
thing
is
from
me
they
hearkened
therefore
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
returned
to
depart
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
then
jeroboam
built
shechem
in
mount
ephraim
and
dwelt
therein
and
went
out
from
thence
and
built
penuel
and
jeroboam
said
in
his
heart
now
shall
the
kingdom
return
to
the
house
of
david
if
this
people
go
up
to
do
sacrifice
in
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
then
shall
the
heart
of
this
people
turn
again
unto
their
lord
even
unto
rehoboam
king
of
judah
and
they
shall
kill
me
and
go
again
to
rehoboam
king
of
judah
whereupon
the
king
took
counsel
and
made
two
calves
of
gold
and
said
unto
them
it
is
too
much
for
you
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
behold
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
he
set
the
one
in
bethel
and
the
other
put
he
in
dan
and
this
thing
became
a
sin
for
the
people
went
to
worship
before
the
one
even
unto
dan
and
he
made
an
house
of
high
places
and
made
priests
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
which
were
not
of
the
sons
of
levi
and
jeroboam
ordained
a
feast
in
the
eighth
month
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
like
unto
the
feast
that
is
in
judah
and
he
offered
upon
the
altar
so
did
he
in
bethel
sacrificing
unto
the
calves
that
he
had
made
and
he
placed
in
bethel
the
priests
of
the
high
places
which
he
had
made
so
he
offered
upon
the
altar
which
he
had
made
in
bethel
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
eighth
month
even
in
the
month
which
he
had
devised
of
his
own
heart
and
ordained
a
feast
unto
the
children
of
israel
and
he
offered
upon
the
altar
and
burnt
incense
and
behold
there
came
a
man
of
god
out
of
judah
by
the
word
of
the
lord
unto
bethel
and
jeroboam
stood
by
the
altar
to
burn
incense
and
he
cried
against
the
altar
in
the
word
of
the
lord
and
said
o
altar
altar
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
a
child
shall
be
born
unto
the
house
of
david
josiah
by
name
and
upon
thee
shall
he
offer
the
priests
of
the
high
places
that
burn
incense
upon
thee
and
men's
bones
shall
be
burnt
upon
thee
and
he
gave
a
sign
the
same
day
saying
this
is
the
sign
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
behold
the
altar
shall
be
rent
and
the
ashes
that
are
upon
it
shall
be
poured
out
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
jeroboam
heard
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
which
had
cried
against
the
altar
in
bethel
that
he
put
forth
his
hand
from
the
altar
saying
lay
hold
on
him
and
his
hand
which
he
put
forth
against
him
dried
up
so
that
he
could
not
pull
it
in
again
to
him
the
altar
also
was
rent
and
the
ashes
poured
out
from
the
altar
according
to
the
sign
which
the
man
of
god
had
given
by
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
king
answered
and
said
unto
the
man
of
god
intreat
now
the
face
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
pray
for
me
that
my
hand
may
be
restored
me
again
and
the
man
of
god
besought
the
lord
and
the
king's
hand
was
restored
him
again
and
became
as
it
was
before
and
the
king
said
unto
the
man
of
god
come
home
with
me
and
refresh
thyself
and
i
will
give
thee
a
reward
and
the
man
of
god
said
unto
the
king
if
thou
wilt
give
me
half
thine
house
i
will
not
go
in
with
thee
neither
will
i
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
in
this
place
for
so
was
it
charged
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
nor
turn
again
by
the
same
way
that
thou
camest
so
he
went
another
way
and
returned
not
by
the
way
that
he
came
to
bethel
now
there
dwelt
an
old
prophet
in
bethel
and
his
sons
came
and
told
him
all
the
works
that
the
man
of
god
had
done
that
day
in
bethel
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
the
king
them
they
told
also
to
their
father
and
their
father
said
unto
them
what
way
went
he
for
his
sons
had
seen
what
way
the
man
of
god
went
which
came
from
judah
and
he
said
unto
his
sons
saddle
me
the
ass
so
they
saddled
him
the
ass
and
he
rode
thereon
and
went
after
the
man
of
god
and
found
him
sitting
under
an
oak
and
he
said
unto
him
art
thou
the
man
of
god
that
camest
from
judah
and
he
said
i
am
then
he
said
unto
him
come
home
with
me
and
eat
bread
and
he
said
i
may
not
return
with
thee
nor
go
in
with
thee
neither
will
i
eat
bread
nor
drink
water
with
thee
in
this
place
for
it
was
said
to
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
thou
shalt
eat
no
bread
nor
drink
water
there
nor
turn
again
to
go
by
the
way
that
thou
camest
he
said
unto
him
i
am
a
prophet
also
as
thou
art
and
an
angel
spake
unto
me
by
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
bring
him
back
with
thee
into
thine
house
that
he
may
eat
bread
and
drink
water
but
he
lied
unto
him
so
he
went
back
with
him
and
did
eat
bread
in
his
house
and
drank
water
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
sat
at
the
table
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
and
he
cried
unto
the
man
of
god
that
came
from
judah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
forasmuch
as
thou
hast
disobeyed
the
mouth
of
the
lord
and
hast
not
kept
the
commandment
which
the
lord
thy
god
commanded
thee
but
camest
back
and
hast
eaten
bread
and
drunk
water
in
the
place
of
the
which
the
lord
did
say
to
thee
eat
no
bread
and
drink
no
water
thy
carcase
shall
not
come
unto
the
sepulchre
of
thy
fathers
and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
eaten
bread
and
after
he
had
drunk
that
he
saddled
for
him
the
ass
to
wit
for
the
prophet
whom
he
had
brought
back
and
when
he
was
gone
a
lion
met
him
by
the
way
and
slew
him
and
his
carcase
was
cast
in
the
way
and
the
ass
stood
by
it
the
lion
also
stood
by
the
carcase
and
behold
men
passed
by
and
saw
the
carcase
cast
in
the
way
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase
and
they
came
and
told
it
in
the
city
where
the
old
prophet
dwelt
and
when
the
prophet
that
brought
him
back
from
the
way
heard
thereof
he
said
it
is
the
man
of
god
who
was
disobedient
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
unto
the
lion
which
hath
torn
him
and
slain
him
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
him
and
he
spake
to
his
sons
saying
saddle
me
the
ass
and
they
saddled
him
and
he
went
and
found
his
carcase
cast
in
the
way
and
the
ass
and
the
lion
standing
by
the
carcase
the
lion
had
not
eaten
the
carcase
nor
torn
the
ass
and
the
prophet
took
up
the
carcase
of
the
man
of
god
and
laid
it
upon
the
ass
and
brought
it
back
and
the
old
prophet
came
to
the
city
to
mourn
and
to
bury
him
and
he
laid
his
carcase
in
his
own
grave
and
they
mourned
over
him
saying
alas
my
brother
and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
buried
him
that
he
spake
to
his
sons
saying
when
i
am
dead
then
bury
me
in
the
sepulchre
wherein
the
man
of
god
is
buried
lay
my
bones
beside
his
bones
for
the
saying
which
he
cried
by
the
word
of
the
lord
against
the
altar
in
bethel
and
against
all
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
are
in
the
cities
of
samaria
shall
surely
come
to
pass
after
this
thing
jeroboam
returned
not
from
his
evil
way
but
made
again
of
the
lowest
of
the
people
priests
of
the
high
places
whosoever
would
he
consecrated
him
and
he
became
one
of
the
priests
of
the
high
places
and
this
thing
became
sin
unto
the
house
of
jeroboam
even
to
cut
it
off
and
to
destroy
it
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
at
that
time
abijah
the
son
of
jeroboam
fell
sick
and
jeroboam
said
to
his
wife
arise
i
pray
thee
and
disguise
thyself
that
thou
be
not
known
to
be
the
wife
of
jeroboam
and
get
thee
to
shiloh
behold
there
is
ahijah
the
prophet
which
told
me
that
i
should
be
king
over
this
people
and
take
with
thee
ten
loaves
and
cracknels
and
a
cruse
of
honey
and
go
to
him
he
shall
tell
thee
what
shall
become
of
the
child
and
jeroboam's
wife
did
so
and
arose
and
went
to
shiloh
and
came
to
the
house
of
ahijah
but
ahijah
could
not
see
for
his
eyes
were
set
by
reason
of
his
age
and
the
lord
said
unto
ahijah
behold
the
wife
of
jeroboam
cometh
to
ask
a
thing
of
thee
for
her
son
for
he
is
sick
thus
and
thus
shalt
thou
say
unto
her
for
it
shall
be
when
she
cometh
in
that
she
shall
feign
herself
to
be
another
woman
and
it
was
so
when
ahijah
heard
the
sound
of
her
feet
as
she
came
in
at
the
door
that
he
said
come
in
thou
wife
of
jeroboam
why
feignest
thou
thyself
to
be
another
for
i
am
sent
to
thee
with
heavy
tidings
go
tell
jeroboam
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
forasmuch
as
i
exalted
thee
from
among
the
people
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
israel
and
rent
the
kingdom
away
from
the
house
of
david
and
gave
it
thee
and
yet
thou
hast
not
been
as
my
servant
david
who
kept
my
commandments
and
who
followed
me
with
all
his
heart
to
do
that
only
which
was
right
in
mine
eyes
but
hast
done
evil
above
all
that
were
before
thee
for
thou
hast
gone
and
made
thee
other
gods
and
molten
images
to
provoke
me
to
anger
and
hast
cast
me
behind
thy
back
therefore
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
the
house
of
jeroboam
and
will
cut
off
from
jeroboam
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
and
will
take
away
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
jeroboam
as
a
man
taketh
away
dung
till
it
be
all
gone
him
that
dieth
of
jeroboam
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
arise
thou
therefore
get
thee
to
thine
own
house
and
when
thy
feet
enter
into
the
city
the
child
shall
die
and
all
israel
shall
mourn
for
him
and
bury
him
for
he
only
of
jeroboam
shall
come
to
the
grave
because
in
him
there
is
found
some
good
thing
toward
the
lord
god
of
israel
in
the
house
of
jeroboam
moreover
the
lord
shall
raise
him
up
a
king
over
israel
who
shall
cut
off
the
house
of
jeroboam
that
day
but
what
even
now
for
the
lord
shall
smite
israel
as
a
reed
is
shaken
in
the
water
and
he
shall
root
up
israel
out
of
this
good
land
which
he
gave
to
their
fathers
and
shall
scatter
them
beyond
the
river
because
they
have
made
their
groves
provoking
the
lord
to
anger
and
he
shall
give
israel
up
because
of
the
sins
of
jeroboam
who
did
sin
and
who
made
israel
to
sin
and
jeroboam's
wife
arose
and
departed
and
came
to
tirzah
and
when
she
came
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
child
died
and
they
buried
him
and
all
israel
mourned
for
him
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
his
servant
ahijah
the
prophet
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jeroboam
how
he
warred
and
how
he
reigned
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
the
days
which
jeroboam
reigned
were
two
and
twenty
years
and
he
slept
with
his
fathers
and
nadab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
rehoboam
the
son
of
solomon
reigned
in
judah
rehoboam
was
forty
and
one
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
seventeen
years
in
jerusalem
the
city
which
the
lord
did
choose
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
to
put
his
name
there
and
his
mother's
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
and
judah
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
they
provoked
him
to
jealousy
with
their
sins
which
they
had
committed
above
all
that
their
fathers
had
done
for
they
also
built
them
high
places
and
images
and
groves
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
were
also
sodomites
in
the
land
and
they
did
according
to
all
the
abominations
of
the
nations
which
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifth
year
of
king
rehoboam
that
shishak
king
of
egypt
came
up
against
jerusalem
and
he
took
away
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
he
even
took
away
all
and
he
took
away
all
the
shields
of
gold
which
solomon
had
made
and
king
rehoboam
made
in
their
stead
brasen
shields
and
committed
them
unto
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
which
kept
the
door
of
the
king's
house
and
it
was
so
when
the
king
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
that
the
guard
bare
them
and
brought
them
back
into
the
guard
chamber
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
rehoboam
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
there
was
war
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
all
their
days
and
rehoboam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
his
mother's
name
was
naamah
an
ammonitess
and
abijam
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
now
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
reigned
abijam
over
judah
three
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
maachah
the
daughter
of
abishalom
and
he
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
his
father
which
he
had
done
before
him
and
his
heart
was
not
perfect
with
the
lord
his
god
as
the
heart
of
david
his
father
nevertheless
for
david's
sake
did
the
lord
his
god
give
him
a
lamp
in
jerusalem
to
set
up
his
son
after
him
and
to
establish
jerusalem
because
david
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
turned
not
aside
from
any
thing
that
he
commanded
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
save
only
in
the
matter
of
uriah
the
hittite
and
there
was
war
between
rehoboam
and
jeroboam
all
the
days
of
his
life
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
abijam
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
there
was
war
between
abijam
and
jeroboam
and
abijam
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
of
david
and
asa
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
in
the
twentieth
year
of
jeroboam
king
of
israel
reigned
asa
over
judah
and
forty
and
one
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
maachah
the
daughter
of
abishalom
and
asa
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
as
did
david
his
father
and
he
took
away
the
sodomites
out
of
the
land
and
removed
all
the
idols
that
his
fathers
had
made
and
also
maachah
his
mother
even
her
he
removed
from
being
queen
because
she
had
made
an
idol
in
a
grove
and
asa
destroyed
her
idol
and
burnt
it
by
the
brook
kidron
but
the
high
places
were
not
removed
nevertheless
asa's
heart
was
perfect
with
the
lord
all
his
days
and
he
brought
in
the
things
which
his
father
had
dedicated
and
the
things
which
himself
had
dedicated
into
the
house
of
the
lord
silver
and
gold
and
vessels
and
there
was
war
between
asa
and
baasha
king
of
israel
all
their
days
and
baasha
king
of
israel
went
up
against
judah
and
built
ramah
that
he
might
not
suffer
any
to
go
out
or
come
in
to
asa
king
of
judah
then
asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
his
servants
and
king
asa
sent
them
to
benhadad
the
son
of
tabrimon
the
son
of
hezion
king
of
syria
that
dwelt
at
damascus
saying
there
is
a
league
between
me
and
thee
and
between
my
father
and
thy
father
behold
i
have
sent
unto
thee
a
present
of
silver
and
gold
come
and
break
thy
league
with
baasha
king
of
israel
that
he
may
depart
from
me
so
benhadad
hearkened
unto
king
asa
and
sent
the
captains
of
the
hosts
which
he
had
against
the
cities
of
israel
and
smote
ijon
and
dan
and
abelbethmaachah
and
all
cinneroth
with
all
the
land
of
naphtali
and
it
came
to
pass
when
baasha
heard
thereof
that
he
left
off
building
of
ramah
and
dwelt
in
tirzah
then
king
asa
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
judah
none
was
exempted
and
they
took
away
the
stones
of
ramah
and
the
timber
thereof
wherewith
baasha
had
builded
and
king
asa
built
with
them
geba
of
benjamin
and
mizpah
the
rest
of
all
the
acts
of
asa
and
all
his
might
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
cities
which
he
built
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
nevertheless
in
the
time
of
his
old
age
he
was
diseased
in
his
feet
and
asa
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
jehoshaphat
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
nadab
the
son
of
jeroboam
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
the
second
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
and
reigned
over
israel
two
years
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
and
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
of
the
house
of
issachar
conspired
against
him
and
baasha
smote
him
at
gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
philistines
for
nadab
and
all
israel
laid
siege
to
gibbethon
even
in
the
third
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
did
baasha
slay
him
and
reigned
in
his
stead
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
reigned
that
he
smote
all
the
house
of
jeroboam
he
left
not
to
jeroboam
any
that
breathed
until
he
had
destroyed
him
according
unto
the
saying
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
ahijah
the
shilonite
because
of
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
he
sinned
and
which
he
made
israel
sin
by
his
provocation
wherewith
he
provoked
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
nadab
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
there
was
war
between
asa
and
baasha
king
of
israel
all
their
days
in
the
third
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
to
reign
over
all
israel
in
tirzah
twenty
and
four
years
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
then
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
against
baasha
saying
forasmuch
as
i
exalted
thee
out
of
the
dust
and
made
thee
prince
over
my
people
israel
and
thou
hast
walked
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
hast
made
my
people
israel
to
sin
to
provoke
me
to
anger
with
their
sins
behold
i
will
take
away
the
posterity
of
baasha
and
the
posterity
of
his
house
and
will
make
thy
house
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
him
that
dieth
of
baasha
in
the
city
shall
the
dogs
eat
and
him
that
dieth
of
his
in
the
fields
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
baasha
and
what
he
did
and
his
might
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
so
baasha
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
tirzah
and
elah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
also
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
came
the
word
of
the
lord
against
baasha
and
against
his
house
even
for
all
the
evil
that
he
did
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
provoking
him
to
anger
with
the
work
of
his
hands
in
being
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
and
because
he
killed
him
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
elah
the
son
of
baasha
to
reign
over
israel
in
tirzah
two
years
and
his
servant
zimri
captain
of
half
his
chariots
conspired
against
him
as
he
was
in
tirzah
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
house
of
arza
steward
of
his
house
in
tirzah
and
zimri
went
in
and
smote
him
and
killed
him
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
and
reigned
in
his
stead
and
it
came
to
pass
when
he
began
to
reign
as
soon
as
he
sat
on
his
throne
that
he
slew
all
the
house
of
baasha
he
left
him
not
one
that
pisseth
against
a
wall
neither
of
his
kinsfolks
nor
of
his
friends
thus
did
zimri
destroy
all
the
house
of
baasha
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
against
baasha
by
jehu
the
prophet
for
all
the
sins
of
baasha
and
the
sins
of
elah
his
son
by
which
they
sinned
and
by
which
they
made
israel
to
sin
in
provoking
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
elah
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
did
zimri
reign
seven
days
in
tirzah
and
the
people
were
encamped
against
gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
philistines
and
the
people
that
were
encamped
heard
say
zimri
hath
conspired
and
hath
also
slain
the
king
wherefore
all
israel
made
omri
the
captain
of
the
host
king
over
israel
that
day
in
the
camp
and
omri
went
up
from
gibbethon
and
all
israel
with
him
and
they
besieged
tirzah
and
it
came
to
pass
when
zimri
saw
that
the
city
was
taken
that
he
went
into
the
palace
of
the
king's
house
and
burnt
the
king's
house
over
him
with
fire
and
died
for
his
sins
which
he
sinned
in
doing
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
walking
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
and
in
his
sin
which
he
did
to
make
israel
to
sin
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
zimri
and
his
treason
that
he
wrought
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
then
were
the
people
of
israel
divided
into
two
parts
half
of
the
people
followed
tibni
the
son
of
ginath
to
make
him
king
and
half
followed
omri
but
the
people
that
followed
omri
prevailed
against
the
people
that
followed
tibni
the
son
of
ginath
so
tibni
died
and
omri
reigned
in
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
omri
to
reign
over
israel
twelve
years
six
years
reigned
he
in
tirzah
and
he
bought
the
hill
samaria
of
shemer
for
two
talents
of
silver
and
built
on
the
hill
and
called
the
name
of
the
city
which
he
built
after
the
name
of
shemer
owner
of
the
hill
samaria
but
omri
wrought
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
did
worse
than
all
that
were
before
him
for
he
walked
in
all
the
way
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
in
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
israel
to
sin
to
provoke
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
with
their
vanities
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
omri
which
he
did
and
his
might
that
he
shewed
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
so
omri
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
samaria
and
ahab
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
of
asa
king
of
judah
began
ahab
the
son
of
omri
to
reign
over
israel
and
ahab
the
son
of
omri
reigned
over
israel
in
samaria
twenty
and
two
years
and
ahab
the
son
of
omri
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
above
all
that
were
before
him
and
it
came
to
pass
as
if
it
had
been
a
light
thing
for
him
to
walk
in
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
that
he
took
to
wife
jezebel
the
daughter
of
ethbaal
king
of
the
zidonians
and
went
and
served
baal
and
worshipped
him
and
he
reared
up
an
altar
for
baal
in
the
house
of
baal
which
he
had
built
in
samaria
and
ahab
made
a
grove
and
ahab
did
more
to
provoke
the
lord
god
of
israel
to
anger
than
all
the
kings
of
israel
that
were
before
him
in
his
days
did
hiel
the
bethelite
build
jericho
he
laid
the
foundation
thereof
in
abiram
his
firstborn
and
set
up
the
gates
thereof
in
his
youngest
son
segub
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
joshua
the
son
of
nun
and
elijah
the
tishbite
who
was
of
the
inhabitants
of
gilead
said
unto
ahab
as
the
lord
god
of
israel
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
there
shall
not
be
dew
nor
rain
these
years
but
according
to
my
word
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
get
thee
hence
and
turn
thee
eastward
and
hide
thyself
by
the
brook
cherith
that
is
before
jordan
and
it
shall
be
that
thou
shalt
drink
of
the
brook
and
i
have
commanded
the
ravens
to
feed
thee
there
so
he
went
and
did
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
for
he
went
and
dwelt
by
the
brook
cherith
that
is
before
jordan
and
the
ravens
brought
him
bread
and
flesh
in
the
morning
and
bread
and
flesh
in
the
evening
and
he
drank
of
the
brook
and
it
came
to
pass
after
a
while
that
the
brook
dried
up
because
there
had
been
no
rain
in
the
land
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying
arise
get
thee
to
zarephath
which
belongeth
to
zidon
and
dwell
there
behold
i
have
commanded
a
widow
woman
there
to
sustain
thee
so
he
arose
and
went
to
zarephath
and
when
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
city
behold
the
widow
woman
was
there
gathering
of
sticks
and
he
called
to
her
and
said
fetch
me
i
pray
thee
a
little
water
in
a
vessel
that
i
may
drink
and
as
she
was
going
to
fetch
it
he
called
to
her
and
said
bring
me
i
pray
thee
a
morsel
of
bread
in
thine
hand
and
she
said
as
the
lord
thy
god
liveth
i
have
not
a
cake
but
an
handful
of
meal
in
a
barrel
and
a
little
oil
in
a
cruse
and
behold
i
am
gathering
two
sticks
that
i
may
go
in
and
dress
it
for
me
and
my
son
that
we
may
eat
it
and
die
and
elijah
said
unto
her
fear
not
go
and
do
as
thou
hast
said
but
make
me
thereof
a
little
cake
first
and
bring
it
unto
me
and
after
make
for
thee
and
for
thy
son
for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
the
barrel
of
meal
shall
not
waste
neither
shall
the
cruse
of
oil
fail
until
the
day
that
the
lord
sendeth
rain
upon
the
earth
and
she
went
and
did
according
to
the
saying
of
elijah
and
she
and
he
and
her
house
did
eat
many
days
and
the
barrel
of
meal
wasted
not
neither
did
the
cruse
of
oil
fail
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
elijah
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
the
son
of
the
woman
the
mistress
of
the
house
fell
sick
and
his
sickness
was
so
sore
that
there
was
no
breath
left
in
him
and
she
said
unto
elijah
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
o
thou
man
of
god
art
thou
come
unto
me
to
call
my
sin
to
remembrance
and
to
slay
my
son
and
he
said
unto
her
give
me
thy
son
and
he
took
him
out
of
her
bosom
and
carried
him
up
into
a
loft
where
he
abode
and
laid
him
upon
his
own
bed
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
my
god
hast
thou
also
brought
evil
upon
the
widow
with
whom
i
sojourn
by
slaying
her
son
and
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
child
three
times
and
cried
unto
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
my
god
i
pray
thee
let
this
child's
soul
come
into
him
again
and
the
lord
heard
the
voice
of
elijah
and
the
soul
of
the
child
came
into
him
again
and
he
revived
and
elijah
took
the
child
and
brought
him
down
out
of
the
chamber
into
the
house
and
delivered
him
unto
his
mother
and
elijah
said
see
thy
son
liveth
and
the
woman
said
to
elijah
now
by
this
i
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
god
and
that
the
word
of
the
lord
in
thy
mouth
is
truth
and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
in
the
third
year
saying
go
shew
thyself
unto
ahab
and
i
will
send
rain
upon
the
earth
and
elijah
went
to
shew
himself
unto
ahab
and
there
was
a
sore
famine
in
samaria
and
ahab
called
obadiah
which
was
the
governor
of
his
house
now
obadiah
feared
the
lord
greatly
for
it
was
so
when
jezebel
cut
off
the
prophets
of
the
lord
that
obadiah
took
an
hundred
prophets
and
hid
them
by
fifty
in
a
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
and
ahab
said
unto
obadiah
go
into
the
land
unto
all
fountains
of
water
and
unto
all
brooks
peradventure
we
may
find
grass
to
save
the
horses
and
mules
alive
that
we
lose
not
all
the
beasts
so
they
divided
the
land
between
them
to
pass
throughout
it
ahab
went
one
way
by
himself
and
obadiah
went
another
way
by
himself
and
as
obadiah
was
in
the
way
behold
elijah
met
him
and
he
knew
him
and
fell
on
his
face
and
said
art
thou
that
my
lord
elijah
and
he
answered
him
i
am
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
and
he
said
what
have
i
sinned
that
thou
wouldest
deliver
thy
servant
into
the
hand
of
ahab
to
slay
me
as
the
lord
thy
god
liveth
there
is
no
nation
or
kingdom
whither
my
lord
hath
not
sent
to
seek
thee
and
when
they
said
he
is
not
there
he
took
an
oath
of
the
kingdom
and
nation
that
they
found
thee
not
and
now
thou
sayest
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
from
thee
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
carry
thee
whither
i
know
not
and
so
when
i
come
and
tell
ahab
and
he
cannot
find
thee
he
shall
slay
me
but
i
thy
servant
fear
the
lord
from
my
youth
was
it
not
told
my
lord
what
i
did
when
jezebel
slew
the
prophets
of
the
lord
how
i
hid
an
hundred
men
of
the
lord's
prophets
by
fifty
in
a
cave
and
fed
them
with
bread
and
water
and
now
thou
sayest
go
tell
thy
lord
behold
elijah
is
here
and
he
shall
slay
me
and
elijah
said
as
the
lord
of
hosts
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
i
will
surely
shew
myself
unto
him
to
day
so
obadiah
went
to
meet
ahab
and
told
him
and
ahab
went
to
meet
elijah
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
saw
elijah
that
ahab
said
unto
him
art
thou
he
that
troubleth
israel
and
he
answered
i
have
not
troubled
israel
but
thou
and
thy
father's
house
in
that
ye
have
forsaken
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
thou
hast
followed
baalim
now
therefore
send
and
gather
to
me
all
israel
unto
mount
carmel
and
the
prophets
of
baal
four
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
prophets
of
the
groves
four
hundred
which
eat
at
jezebel's
table
so
ahab
sent
unto
all
the
children
of
israel
and
gathered
the
prophets
together
unto
mount
carmel
and
elijah
came
unto
all
the
people
and
said
how
long
halt
ye
between
two
opinions
if
the
lord
be
god
follow
him
but
if
baal
then
follow
him
and
the
people
answered
him
not
a
word
then
said
elijah
unto
the
people
i
even
i
only
remain
a
prophet
of
the
lord
but
baal's
prophets
are
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
let
them
therefore
give
us
two
bullocks
and
let
them
choose
one
bullock
for
themselves
and
cut
it
in
pieces
and
lay
it
on
wood
and
put
no
fire
under
and
i
will
dress
the
other
bullock
and
lay
it
on
wood
and
put
no
fire
under
and
call
ye
on
the
name
of
your
gods
and
i
will
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
and
the
god
that
answereth
by
fire
let
him
be
god
and
all
the
people
answered
and
said
it
is
well
spoken
and
elijah
said
unto
the
prophets
of
baal
choose
you
one
bullock
for
yourselves
and
dress
it
first
for
ye
are
many
and
call
on
the
name
of
your
gods
but
put
no
fire
under
and
they
took
the
bullock
which
was
given
them
and
they
dressed
it
and
called
on
the
name
of
baal
from
morning
even
until
noon
saying
o
baal
hear
us
but
there
was
no
voice
nor
any
that
answered
and
they
leaped
upon
the
altar
which
was
made
and
it
came
to
pass
at
noon
that
elijah
mocked
them
and
said
cry
aloud
for
he
is
a
god
either
he
is
talking
or
he
is
pursuing
or
he
is
in
a
journey
or
peradventure
he
sleepeth
and
must
be
awaked
and
they
cried
aloud
and
cut
themselves
after
their
manner
with
knives
and
lancets
till
the
blood
gushed
out
upon
them
and
it
came
to
pass
when
midday
was
past
and
they
prophesied
until
the
time
of
the
offering
of
the
evening
sacrifice
that
there
was
neither
voice
nor
any
to
answer
nor
any
that
regarded
and
elijah
said
unto
all
the
people
come
near
unto
me
and
all
the
people
came
near
unto
him
and
he
repaired
the
altar
of
the
lord
that
was
broken
down
and
elijah
took
twelve
stones
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
sons
of
jacob
unto
whom
the
word
of
the
lord
came
saying
israel
shall
be
thy
name
and
with
the
stones
he
built
an
altar
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
he
made
a
trench
about
the
altar
as
great
as
would
contain
two
measures
of
seed
and
he
put
the
wood
in
order
and
cut
the
bullock
in
pieces
and
laid
him
on
the
wood
and
said
fill
four
barrels
with
water
and
pour
it
on
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
on
the
wood
and
he
said
do
it
the
second
time
and
they
did
it
the
second
time
and
he
said
do
it
the
third
time
and
they
did
it
the
third
time
and
the
water
ran
round
about
the
altar
and
he
filled
the
trench
also
with
water
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
time
of
the
offering
of
the
evening
sacrifice
that
elijah
the
prophet
came
near
and
said
lord
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
of
israel
let
it
be
known
this
day
that
thou
art
god
in
israel
and
that
i
am
thy
servant
and
that
i
have
done
all
these
things
at
thy
word
hear
me
o
lord
hear
me
that
this
people
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
god
and
that
thou
hast
turned
their
heart
back
again
then
the
fire
of
the
lord
fell
and
consumed
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
the
wood
and
the
stones
and
the
dust
and
licked
up
the
water
that
was
in
the
trench
and
when
all
the
people
saw
it
they
fell
on
their
faces
and
they
said
the
lord
he
is
the
god
the
lord
he
is
the
god
and
elijah
said
unto
them
take
the
prophets
of
baal
let
not
one
of
them
escape
and
they
took
them
and
elijah
brought
them
down
to
the
brook
kishon
and
slew
them
there
and
elijah
said
unto
ahab
get
thee
up
eat
and
drink
for
there
is
a
sound
of
abundance
of
rain
so
ahab
went
up
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
elijah
went
up
to
the
top
of
carmel
and
he
cast
himself
down
upon
the
earth
and
put
his
face
between
his
knees
and
said
to
his
servant
go
up
now
look
toward
the
sea
and
he
went
up
and
looked
and
said
there
is
nothing
and
he
said
go
again
seven
times
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seventh
time
that
he
said
behold
there
ariseth
a
little
cloud
out
of
the
sea
like
a
man's
hand
and
he
said
go
up
say
unto
ahab
prepare
thy
chariot
and
get
thee
down
that
the
rain
stop
thee
not
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
mean
while
that
the
heaven
was
black
with
clouds
and
wind
and
there
was
a
great
rain
and
ahab
rode
and
went
to
jezreel
and
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
on
elijah
and
he
girded
up
his
loins
and
ran
before
ahab
to
the
entrance
of
jezreel
and
ahab
told
jezebel
all
that
elijah
had
done
and
withal
how
he
had
slain
all
the
prophets
with
the
sword
then
jezebel
sent
a
messenger
unto
elijah
saying
so
let
the
gods
do
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
make
not
thy
life
as
the
life
of
one
of
them
by
to
morrow
about
this
time
and
when
he
saw
that
he
arose
and
went
for
his
life
and
came
to
beersheba
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
left
his
servant
there
but
he
himself
went
a
day's
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
came
and
sat
down
under
a
juniper
tree
and
he
requested
for
himself
that
he
might
die
and
said
it
is
enough
now
o
lord
take
away
my
life
for
i
am
not
better
than
my
fathers
and
as
he
lay
and
slept
under
a
juniper
tree
behold
then
an
angel
touched
him
and
said
unto
him
arise
and
eat
and
he
looked
and
behold
there
was
a
cake
baken
on
the
coals
and
a
cruse
of
water
at
his
head
and
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
laid
him
down
again
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
again
the
second
time
and
touched
him
and
said
arise
and
eat
because
the
journey
is
too
great
for
thee
and
he
arose
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
went
in
the
strength
of
that
meat
forty
days
and
forty
nights
unto
horeb
the
mount
of
god
and
he
came
thither
unto
a
cave
and
lodged
there
and
behold
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
him
and
he
said
unto
him
what
doest
thou
here
elijah
and
he
said
i
have
been
very
jealous
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
the
children
of
israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
i
even
i
only
am
left
and
they
seek
my
life
to
take
it
away
and
he
said
go
forth
and
stand
upon
the
mount
before
the
lord
and
behold
the
lord
passed
by
and
a
great
and
strong
wind
rent
the
mountains
and
brake
in
pieces
the
rocks
before
the
lord
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
wind
and
after
the
wind
an
earthquake
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
earthquake
and
after
the
earthquake
a
fire
but
the
lord
was
not
in
the
fire
and
after
the
fire
a
still
small
voice
and
it
was
so
when
elijah
heard
it
that
he
wrapped
his
face
in
his
mantle
and
went
out
and
stood
in
the
entering
in
of
the
cave
and
behold
there
came
a
voice
unto
him
and
said
what
doest
thou
here
elijah
and
he
said
i
have
been
very
jealous
for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
because
the
children
of
israel
have
forsaken
thy
covenant
thrown
down
thine
altars
and
slain
thy
prophets
with
the
sword
and
i
even
i
only
am
left
and
they
seek
my
life
to
take
it
away
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
go
return
on
thy
way
to
the
wilderness
of
damascus
and
when
thou
comest
anoint
hazael
to
be
king
over
syria
and
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
shalt
thou
anoint
to
be
king
over
israel
and
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
of
abelmeholah
shalt
thou
anoint
to
be
prophet
in
thy
room
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
him
that
escapeth
the
sword
of
hazael
shall
jehu
slay
and
him
that
escapeth
from
the
sword
of
jehu
shall
elisha
slay
yet
i
have
left
me
seven
thousand
in
israel
all
the
knees
which
have
not
bowed
unto
baal
and
every
mouth
which
hath
not
kissed
him
so
he
departed
thence
and
found
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
who
was
plowing
with
twelve
yoke
of
oxen
before
him
and
he
with
the
twelfth
and
elijah
passed
by
him
and
cast
his
mantle
upon
him
and
he
left
the
oxen
and
ran
after
elijah
and
said
let
me
i
pray
thee
kiss
my
father
and
my
mother
and
then
i
will
follow
thee
and
he
said
unto
him
go
back
again
for
what
have
i
done
to
thee
and
he
returned
back
from
him
and
took
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
slew
them
and
boiled
their
flesh
with
the
instruments
of
the
oxen
and
gave
unto
the
people
and
they
did
eat
then
he
arose
and
went
after
elijah
and
ministered
unto
him
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
gathered
all
his
host
together
and
there
were
thirty
and
two
kings
with
him
and
horses
and
chariots
and
he
went
up
and
besieged
samaria
and
warred
against
it
and
he
sent
messengers
to
ahab
king
of
israel
into
the
city
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
benhadad
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
is
mine
thy
wives
also
and
thy
children
even
the
goodliest
are
mine
and
the
king
of
israel
answered
and
said
my
lord
o
king
according
to
thy
saying
i
am
thine
and
all
that
i
have
and
the
messengers
came
again
and
said
thus
speaketh
benhadad
saying
although
i
have
sent
unto
thee
saying
thou
shalt
deliver
me
thy
silver
and
thy
gold
and
thy
wives
and
thy
children
yet
i
will
send
my
servants
unto
thee
to
morrow
about
this
time
and
they
shall
search
thine
house
and
the
houses
of
thy
servants
and
it
shall
be
that
whatsoever
is
pleasant
in
thine
eyes
they
shall
put
it
in
their
hand
and
take
it
away
then
the
king
of
israel
called
all
the
elders
of
the
land
and
said
mark
i
pray
you
and
see
how
this
man
seeketh
mischief
for
he
sent
unto
me
for
my
wives
and
for
my
children
and
for
my
silver
and
for
my
gold
and
i
denied
him
not
and
all
the
elders
and
all
the
people
said
unto
him
hearken
not
unto
him
nor
consent
wherefore
he
said
unto
the
messengers
of
benhadad
tell
my
lord
the
king
all
that
thou
didst
send
for
to
thy
servant
at
the
first
i
will
do
but
this
thing
i
may
not
do
and
the
messengers
departed
and
brought
him
word
again
and
benhadad
sent
unto
him
and
said
the
gods
do
so
unto
me
and
more
also
if
the
dust
of
samaria
shall
suffice
for
handfuls
for
all
the
people
that
follow
me
and
the
king
of
israel
answered
and
said
tell
him
let
not
him
that
girdeth
on
his
harness
boast
himself
as
he
that
putteth
it
off
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ben-hadad
heard
this
message
as
he
was
drinking
he
and
the
kings
in
the
pavilions
that
he
said
unto
his
servants
set
yourselves
in
array
and
they
set
themselves
in
array
against
the
city
and
behold
there
came
a
prophet
unto
ahab
king
of
israel
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hast
thou
seen
all
this
great
multitude
behold
i
will
deliver
it
into
thine
hand
this
day
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
ahab
said
by
whom
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
even
by
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
then
he
said
who
shall
order
the
battle
and
he
answered
thou
then
he
numbered
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
and
they
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
two
and
after
them
he
numbered
all
the
people
even
all
the
children
of
israel
being
seven
thousand
and
they
went
out
at
noon
but
benhadad
was
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
pavilions
he
and
the
kings
the
thirty
and
two
kings
that
helped
him
and
the
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
went
out
first
and
benhadad
sent
out
and
they
told
him
saying
there
are
men
come
out
of
samaria
and
he
said
whether
they
be
come
out
for
peace
take
them
alive
or
whether
they
be
come
out
for
war
take
them
alive
so
these
young
men
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
came
out
of
the
city
and
the
army
which
followed
them
and
they
slew
every
one
his
man
and
the
syrians
fled
and
israel
pursued
them
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
escaped
on
an
horse
with
the
horsemen
and
the
king
of
israel
went
out
and
smote
the
horses
and
chariots
and
slew
the
syrians
with
a
great
slaughter
and
the
prophet
came
to
the
king
of
israel
and
said
unto
him
go
strengthen
thyself
and
mark
and
see
what
thou
doest
for
at
the
return
of
the
year
the
king
of
syria
will
come
up
against
thee
and
the
servants
of
the
king
of
syria
said
unto
him
their
gods
are
gods
of
the
hills
therefore
they
were
stronger
than
we
but
let
us
fight
against
them
in
the
plain
and
surely
we
shall
be
stronger
than
they
and
do
this
thing
take
the
kings
away
every
man
out
of
his
place
and
put
captains
in
their
rooms
and
number
thee
an
army
like
the
army
that
thou
hast
lost
horse
for
horse
and
chariot
for
chariot
and
we
will
fight
against
them
in
the
plain
and
surely
we
shall
be
stronger
than
they
and
he
hearkened
unto
their
voice
and
did
so
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
return
of
the
year
that
benhadad
numbered
the
syrians
and
went
up
to
aphek
to
fight
against
israel
and
the
children
of
israel
were
numbered
and
were
all
present
and
went
against
them
and
the
children
of
israel
pitched
before
them
like
two
little
flocks
of
kids
but
the
syrians
filled
the
country
and
there
came
a
man
of
god
and
spake
unto
the
king
of
israel
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
because
the
syrians
have
said
the
lord
is
god
of
the
hills
but
he
is
not
god
of
the
valleys
therefore
will
i
deliver
all
this
great
multitude
into
thine
hand
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
and
they
pitched
one
over
against
the
other
seven
days
and
so
it
was
that
in
the
seventh
day
the
battle
was
joined
and
the
children
of
israel
slew
of
the
syrians
an
hundred
thousand
footmen
in
one
day
but
the
rest
fled
to
aphek
into
the
city
and
there
a
wall
fell
upon
twenty
and
seven
thousand
of
the
men
that
were
left
and
benhadad
fled
and
came
into
the
city
into
an
inner
chamber
and
his
servants
said
unto
him
behold
now
we
have
heard
that
the
kings
of
the
house
of
israel
are
merciful
kings
let
us
i
pray
thee
put
sackcloth
on
our
loins
and
ropes
upon
our
heads
and
go
out
to
the
king
of
israel
peradventure
he
will
save
thy
life
so
they
girded
sackcloth
on
their
loins
and
put
ropes
on
their
heads
and
came
to
the
king
of
israel
and
said
thy
servant
benhadad
saith
i
pray
thee
let
me
live
and
he
said
is
he
yet
alive
he
is
my
brother
now
the
men
did
diligently
observe
whether
any
thing
would
come
from
him
and
did
hastily
catch
it
and
they
said
thy
brother
benhadad
then
he
said
go
ye
bring
him
then
benhadad
came
forth
to
him
and
he
caused
him
to
come
up
into
the
chariot
and
ben-hadad
said
unto
him
the
cities
which
my
father
took
from
thy
father
i
will
restore
and
thou
shalt
make
streets
for
thee
in
damascus
as
my
father
made
in
samaria
then
said
ahab
i
will
send
thee
away
with
this
covenant
so
he
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
sent
him
away
and
a
certain
man
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
unto
his
neighbour
in
the
word
of
the
lord
smite
me
i
pray
thee
and
the
man
refused
to
smite
him
then
said
he
unto
him
because
thou
hast
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
behold
as
soon
as
thou
art
departed
from
me
a
lion
shall
slay
thee
and
as
soon
as
he
was
departed
from
him
a
lion
found
him
and
slew
him
then
he
found
another
man
and
said
smite
me
i
pray
thee
and
the
man
smote
him
so
that
in
smiting
he
wounded
him
so
the
prophet
departed
and
waited
for
the
king
by
the
way
and
disguised
himself
with
ashes
upon
his
face
and
as
the
king
passed
by
he
cried
unto
the
king
and
he
said
thy
servant
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
battle
and
behold
a
man
turned
aside
and
brought
a
man
unto
me
and
said
keep
this
man
if
by
any
means
he
be
missing
then
shall
thy
life
be
for
his
life
or
else
thou
shalt
pay
a
talent
of
silver
and
as
thy
servant
was
busy
here
and
there
he
was
gone
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
him
so
shall
thy
judgment
be
thyself
hast
decided
it
and
he
hasted
and
took
the
ashes
away
from
his
face
and
the
king
of
israel
discerned
him
that
he
was
of
the
prophets
and
he
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
because
thou
hast
let
go
out
of
thy
hand
a
man
whom
i
appointed
to
utter
destruction
therefore
thy
life
shall
go
for
his
life
and
thy
people
for
his
people
and
the
king
of
israel
went
to
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
and
came
to
samaria
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
naboth
the
jezreelite
had
a
vineyard
which
was
in
jezreel
hard
by
the
palace
of
ahab
king
of
samaria
and
ahab
spake
unto
naboth
saying
give
me
thy
vineyard
that
i
may
have
it
for
a
garden
of
herbs
because
it
is
near
unto
my
house
and
i
will
give
thee
for
it
a
better
vineyard
than
it
or
if
it
seem
good
to
thee
i
will
give
thee
the
worth
of
it
in
money
and
naboth
said
to
ahab
the
lord
forbid
it
me
that
i
should
give
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
unto
thee
and
ahab
came
into
his
house
heavy
and
displeased
because
of
the
word
which
naboth
the
jezreelite
had
spoken
to
him
for
he
had
said
i
will
not
give
thee
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
and
he
laid
him
down
upon
his
bed
and
turned
away
his
face
and
would
eat
no
bread
but
jezebel
his
wife
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
why
is
thy
spirit
so
sad
that
thou
eatest
no
bread
and
he
said
unto
her
because
i
spake
unto
naboth
the
jezreelite
and
said
unto
him
give
me
thy
vineyard
for
money
or
else
if
it
please
thee
i
will
give
thee
another
vineyard
for
it
and
he
answered
i
will
not
give
thee
my
vineyard
and
jezebel
his
wife
said
unto
him
dost
thou
now
govern
the
kingdom
of
israel
arise
and
eat
bread
and
let
thine
heart
be
merry
i
will
give
thee
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
so
she
wrote
letters
in
ahab's
name
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal
and
sent
the
letters
unto
the
elders
and
to
the
nobles
that
were
in
his
city
dwelling
with
naboth
and
she
wrote
in
the
letters
saying
proclaim
a
fast
and
set
naboth
on
high
among
the
people
and
set
two
men
sons
of
belial
before
him
to
bear
witness
against
him
saying
thou
didst
blaspheme
god
and
the
king
and
then
carry
him
out
and
stone
him
that
he
may
die
and
the
men
of
his
city
even
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
were
the
inhabitants
in
his
city
did
as
jezebel
had
sent
unto
them
and
as
it
was
written
in
the
letters
which
she
had
sent
unto
them
they
proclaimed
a
fast
and
set
naboth
on
high
among
the
people
and
there
came
in
two
men
children
of
belial
and
sat
before
him
and
the
men
of
belial
witnessed
against
him
even
against
naboth
in
the
presence
of
the
people
saying
naboth
did
blaspheme
god
and
the
king
then
they
carried
him
forth
out
of
the
city
and
stoned
him
with
stones
that
he
died
then
they
sent
to
jezebel
saying
naboth
is
stoned
and
is
dead
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jezebel
heard
that
naboth
was
stoned
and
was
dead
that
jezebel
said
to
ahab
arise
take
possession
of
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
which
he
refused
to
give
thee
for
money
for
naboth
is
not
alive
but
dead
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
heard
that
naboth
was
dead
that
ahab
rose
up
to
go
down
to
the
vineyard
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
to
take
possession
of
it
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
arise
go
down
to
meet
ahab
king
of
israel
which
is
in
samaria
behold
he
is
in
the
vineyard
of
naboth
whither
he
is
gone
down
to
possess
it
and
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
hast
thou
killed
and
also
taken
possession
and
thou
shalt
speak
unto
him
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
in
the
place
where
dogs
licked
the
blood
of
naboth
shall
dogs
lick
thy
blood
even
thine
and
ahab
said
to
elijah
hast
thou
found
me
o
mine
enemy
and
he
answered
i
have
found
thee
because
thou
hast
sold
thyself
to
work
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
thee
and
will
take
away
thy
posterity
and
will
cut
off
from
ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
and
will
make
thine
house
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
like
the
house
of
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
for
the
provocation
wherewith
thou
hast
provoked
me
to
anger
and
made
israel
to
sin
and
of
jezebel
also
spake
the
lord
saying
the
dogs
shall
eat
jezebel
by
the
wall
of
jezreel
him
that
dieth
of
ahab
in
the
city
the
dogs
shall
eat
and
him
that
dieth
in
the
field
shall
the
fowls
of
the
air
eat
but
there
was
none
like
unto
ahab
which
did
sell
himself
to
work
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
whom
jezebel
his
wife
stirred
up
and
he
did
very
abominably
in
following
idols
according
to
all
things
as
did
the
amorites
whom
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
heard
those
words
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
put
sackcloth
upon
his
flesh
and
fasted
and
lay
in
sackcloth
and
went
softly
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
seest
thou
how
ahab
humbleth
himself
before
me
because
he
humbleth
himself
before
me
i
will
not
bring
the
evil
in
his
days
but
in
his
son's
days
will
i
bring
the
evil
upon
his
house
and
they
continued
three
years
without
war
between
syria
and
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year
that
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
came
down
to
the
king
of
israel
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
his
servants
know
ye
that
ramoth
in
gilead
is
ours
and
we
be
still
and
take
it
not
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
and
he
said
unto
jehoshaphat
wilt
thou
go
with
me
to
battle
to
ramothgilead
and
jehoshaphat
said
to
the
king
of
israel
i
am
as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people
my
horses
as
thy
horses
and
jehoshaphat
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
enquire
i
pray
thee
at
the
word
of
the
lord
to
day
then
the
king
of
israel
gathered
the
prophets
together
about
four
hundred
men
and
said
unto
them
shall
i
go
against
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
they
said
go
up
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
and
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
besides
that
we
might
enquire
of
him
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
there
is
yet
one
man
micaiah
the
son
of
imlah
by
whom
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
but
i
hate
him
for
he
doth
not
prophesy
good
concerning
me
but
evil
and
jehoshaphat
said
let
not
the
king
say
so
then
the
king
of
israel
called
an
officer
and
said
hasten
hither
micaiah
the
son
of
imlah
and
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
sat
each
on
his
throne
having
put
on
their
robes
in
a
void
place
in
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
samaria
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
before
them
and
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
made
him
horns
of
iron
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
with
these
shalt
thou
push
the
syrians
until
thou
have
consumed
them
and
all
the
prophets
prophesied
so
saying
go
up
to
ramothgilead
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
king's
hand
and
the
messenger
that
was
gone
to
call
micaiah
spake
unto
him
saying
behold
now
the
words
of
the
prophets
declare
good
unto
the
king
with
one
mouth
let
thy
word
i
pray
thee
be
like
the
word
of
one
of
them
and
speak
that
which
is
good
and
micaiah
said
as
the
lord
liveth
what
the
lord
saith
unto
me
that
will
i
speak
so
he
came
to
the
king
and
the
king
said
unto
him
micaiah
shall
we
go
against
ramothgilead
to
battle
or
shall
we
forbear
and
he
answered
him
go
and
prosper
for
the
lord
shall
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
king
and
the
king
said
unto
him
how
many
times
shall
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
tell
me
nothing
but
that
which
is
true
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
he
said
i
saw
all
israel
scattered
upon
the
hills
as
sheep
that
have
not
a
shepherd
and
the
lord
said
these
have
no
master
let
them
return
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
would
prophesy
no
good
concerning
me
but
evil
and
he
said
hear
thou
therefore
the
word
of
the
lord
i
saw
the
lord
sitting
on
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
by
him
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
persuade
ahab
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
ramothgilead
and
one
said
on
this
manner
and
another
said
on
that
manner
and
there
came
forth
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
persuade
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
and
he
said
i
will
go
forth
and
i
will
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
he
said
thou
shalt
persude
him
and
prevail
also
go
forth
and
do
so
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
concerning
thee
but
zedekiah
the
son
of
chenaanah
went
near
and
smote
micaiah
on
the
cheek
and
said
which
way
went
the
spirit
of
the
lord
from
me
to
speak
unto
thee
and
micaiah
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
in
that
day
when
thou
shalt
go
into
an
inner
chamber
to
hide
thyself
and
the
king
of
israel
said
take
micaiah
and
carry
him
back
unto
amon
the
governor
of
the
city
and
to
joash
the
king's
son
and
say
thus
saith
the
king
put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
bread
of
affliction
and
with
water
of
affliction
until
i
come
in
peace
and
micaiah
said
if
thou
return
at
all
in
peace
the
lord
hath
not
spoken
by
me
and
he
said
hearken
o
people
every
one
of
you
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
went
up
to
ramothgilead
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
jehoshaphat
i
will
disguise
myself
and
enter
into
the
battle
but
put
thou
on
thy
robes
and
the
king
of
israel
disguised
himself
and
went
into
the
battle
but
the
king
of
syria
commanded
his
thirty
and
two
captains
that
had
rule
over
his
chariots
saying
fight
neither
with
small
nor
great
save
only
with
the
king
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
saw
jehoshaphat
that
they
said
surely
it
is
the
king
of
israel
and
they
turned
aside
to
fight
against
him
and
jehoshaphat
cried
out
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
captains
of
the
chariots
perceived
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
israel
that
they
turned
back
from
pursuing
him
and
a
certain
man
drew
a
bow
at
a
venture
and
smote
the
king
of
israel
between
the
joints
of
the
harness
wherefore
he
said
unto
the
driver
of
his
chariot
turn
thine
hand
and
carry
me
out
of
the
host
for
i
am
wounded
and
the
battle
increased
that
day
and
the
king
was
stayed
up
in
his
chariot
against
the
syrians
and
died
at
even
and
the
blood
ran
out
of
the
wound
into
the
midst
of
the
chariot
and
there
went
a
proclamation
throughout
the
host
about
the
going
down
of
the
sun
saying
every
man
to
his
city
and
every
man
to
his
own
country
so
the
king
died
and
was
brought
to
samaria
and
they
buried
the
king
in
samaria
and
one
washed
the
chariot
in
the
pool
of
samaria
and
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood
and
they
washed
his
armour
according
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahab
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
ivory
house
which
he
made
and
all
the
cities
that
he
built
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
so
ahab
slept
with
his
fathers
and
ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
asa
began
to
reign
over
judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
ahab
king
of
israel
jehoshaphat
was
thirty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
azubah
the
daughter
of
shilhi
and
he
walked
in
all
the
ways
of
asa
his
father
he
turned
not
aside
from
it
doing
that
which
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
nevertheless
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
for
the
people
offered
and
burnt
incense
yet
in
the
high
places
and
jehoshaphat
made
peace
with
the
king
of
israel
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehoshaphat
and
his
might
that
he
shewed
and
how
he
warred
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
the
remnant
of
the
sodomites
which
remained
in
the
days
of
his
father
asa
he
took
out
of
the
land
there
was
then
no
king
in
edom
a
deputy
was
king
jehoshaphat
made
ships
of
tharshish
to
go
to
ophir
for
gold
but
they
went
not
for
the
ships
were
broken
at
eziongeber
then
said
ahaziah
the
son
of
ahab
unto
jehoshaphat
let
my
servants
go
with
thy
servants
in
the
ships
but
jehoshaphat
would
not
and
jehoshaphat
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
his
father
and
jehoram
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
ahaziah
the
son
of
ahab
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
the
seventeenth
year
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
and
reigned
two
years
over
israel
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
in
the
way
of
his
mother
and
in
the
way
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
for
he
served
baal
and
worshipped
him
and
provoked
to
anger
the
lord
god
of
israel
according
to
all
that
his
father
had
done
the
second
book
of
the
kings
commonly
called
the
fourth
book
of
the
kings
then
moab
rebelled
against
israel
after
the
death
of
ahab
and
ahaziah
fell
down
through
a
lattice
in
his
upper
chamber
that
was
in
samaria
and
was
sick
and
he
sent
messengers
and
said
unto
them
go
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
whether
i
shall
recover
of
this
disease
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
to
elijah
the
tishbite
arise
go
up
to
meet
the
messengers
of
the
king
of
samaria
and
say
unto
them
is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
god
in
israel
that
ye
go
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
now
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
and
elijah
departed
and
when
the
messengers
turned
back
unto
him
he
said
unto
them
why
are
ye
now
turned
back
and
they
said
unto
him
there
came
a
man
up
to
meet
us
and
said
unto
us
go
turn
again
unto
the
king
that
sent
you
and
say
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
is
it
not
because
there
is
not
a
god
in
israel
that
thou
sendest
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
from
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
and
he
said
unto
them
what
manner
of
man
was
he
which
came
up
to
meet
you
and
told
you
these
words
and
they
answered
him
he
was
an
hairy
man
and
girt
with
a
girdle
of
leather
about
his
loins
and
he
said
it
is
elijah
the
tishbite
then
the
king
sent
unto
him
a
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
he
went
up
to
him
and
behold
he
sat
on
the
top
of
an
hill
and
he
spake
unto
him
thou
man
of
god
the
king
hath
said
come
down
and
elijah
answered
and
said
to
the
captain
of
fifty
if
i
be
a
man
of
god
then
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty
and
there
came
down
fire
from
heaven
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty
again
also
he
sent
unto
him
another
captain
of
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
o
man
of
god
thus
hath
the
king
said
come
down
quickly
and
elijah
answered
and
said
unto
them
if
i
be
a
man
of
god
let
fire
come
down
from
heaven
and
consume
thee
and
thy
fifty
and
the
fire
of
god
came
down
from
heaven
and
consumed
him
and
his
fifty
and
he
sent
again
a
captain
of
the
third
fifty
with
his
fifty
and
the
third
captain
of
fifty
went
up
and
came
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
elijah
and
besought
him
and
said
unto
him
o
man
of
god
i
pray
thee
let
my
life
and
the
life
of
these
fifty
thy
servants
be
precious
in
thy
sight
behold
there
came
fire
down
from
heaven
and
burnt
up
the
two
captains
of
the
former
fifties
with
their
fifties
therefore
let
my
life
now
be
precious
in
thy
sight
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
elijah
go
down
with
him
be
not
afraid
of
him
and
he
arose
and
went
down
with
him
unto
the
king
and
he
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
forasmuch
as
thou
hast
sent
messengers
to
enquire
of
baalzebub
the
god
of
ekron
is
it
not
because
there
is
no
god
in
israel
to
enquire
of
his
word
therefore
thou
shalt
not
come
down
off
that
bed
on
which
thou
art
gone
up
but
shalt
surely
die
so
he
died
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
elijah
had
spoken
and
jehoram
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
second
year
of
jehoram
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
because
he
had
no
son
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahaziah
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
lord
would
take
up
elijah
into
heaven
by
a
whirlwind
that
elijah
went
with
elisha
from
gilgal
and
elijah
said
unto
elisha
tarry
here
i
pray
thee
for
the
lord
hath
sent
me
to
bethel
and
elisha
said
unto
him
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
so
they
went
down
to
bethel
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
that
were
at
bethel
came
forth
to
elisha
and
said
unto
him
knowest
thou
that
the
lord
will
take
away
thy
master
from
thy
head
to
day
and
he
said
yea

jordan
and
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
and
they
two
went
on
and
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
went
and
stood
to
view
afar
off
and
they
two
stood
by
jordan
and
elijah
took
his
mantle
and
wrapped
it
together
and
smote
the
waters
and
they
were
divided
hither
and
thither
so
that
they
two
went
over
on
dry
ground
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
gone
over
that
elijah
said
unto
elisha
ask
what
i
shall
do
for
thee
before
i
be
taken
away
from
thee
and
elisha
said
i
pray
thee
let
a
double
portion
of
thy
spirit
be
upon
me
and
he
said
thou
hast
asked
a
hard
thing
nevertheless
if
thou
see
me
when
i
am
taken
from
thee
it
shall
be
so
unto
thee
but
if
not
it
shall
not
be
so
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
still
went
on
and
talked
that
behold
there
appeared
a
chariot
of
fire
and
horses
of
fire
and
parted
them
both
asunder
and
elijah
went
up
by
a
whirlwind
into
heaven
and
elisha
saw
it
and
he
cried
my
father
my
father
the
chariot
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
and
he
saw
him
no
more
and
he
took
hold
of
his
own
clothes
and
rent
them
in
two
pieces
he
took
up
also
the
mantle
of
elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
went
back
and
stood
by
the
bank
of
jordan
and
he
took
the
mantle
of
elijah
that
fell
from
him
and
smote
the
waters
and
said
where
is
the
lord
god
of
elijah
and
when
he
also
had
smitten
the
waters
they
parted
hither
and
thither
and
elisha
went
over
and
when
the
sons
of
the
prophets
which
were
to
view
at
jericho
saw
him
they
said
the
spirit
of
elijah
doth
rest
on
elisha
and
they
came
to
meet
him
and
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
before
him
and
they
said
unto
him
behold
now
there
be
with
thy
servants
fifty
strong
men
let
them
go
we
pray
thee
and
seek
thy
master
lest
peradventure
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
taken
him
up
and
cast
him
upon
some
mountain
or
into
some
valley
and
he
said
ye
shall
not
send
and
when
they
urged
him
till
he
was
ashamed
he
said
send
they
sent
therefore
fifty
men
and
they
sought
three
days
but
found
him
not
and
when
they
came
again
to
him
for
he
tarried
at
jericho
he
said
unto
them
did
i
not
say
unto
you
go
not
and
the
men
of
the
city
said
unto
elisha
behold
i
pray
thee
the
situation
of
this
city
is
pleasant
as
my
lord
seeth
but
the
water
is
naught
and
the
ground
barren
and
he
said
bring
me
a
new
cruse
and
put
salt
therein
and
they
brought
it
to
him
and
he
went
forth
unto
the
spring
of
the
waters
and
cast
the
salt
in
there
and
said
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
healed
these
waters
there
shall
not
be
from
thence
any
more
death
or
barren
land
so
the
waters
were
healed
unto
this
day
according
to
the
saying
of
elisha
which
he
spake
and
he
went
up
from
thence
unto
bethel
and
as
he
was
going
up
by
the
way
there
came
forth
little
children
out
of
the
city
and
mocked
him
and
said
unto
him
go
up
thou
bald
head
go
up
thou
bald
head
and
he
turned
back
and
looked
on
them
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
there
came
forth
two
she
bears
out
of
the
wood
and
tare
forty
and
two
children
of
them
and
he
went
from
thence
to
mount
carmel
and
from
thence
he
returned
to
samaria
now
jehoram
the
son
of
ahab
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
the
eighteenth
year
of
jehoshaphat
king
of
judah
and
reigned
twelve
years
and
he
wrought
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
not
like
his
father
and
like
his
mother
for
he
put
away
the
image
of
baal
that
his
father
had
made
nevertheless
he
cleaved
unto
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
which
made
israel
to
sin
he
departed
not
therefrom
and
mesha
king
of
moab
was
a
sheepmaster
and
rendered
unto
the
king
of
israel
an
hundred
thousand
lambs
and
an
hundred
thousand
rams
with
the
wool
but
it
came
to
pass
when
ahab
was
dead
that
the
king
of
moab
rebelled
against
the
king
of
israel
and
king
jehoram
went
out
of
samaria
the
same
time
and
numbered
all
israel
and
he
went
and
sent
to
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
saying
the
king
of
moab
hath
rebelled
against
me
wilt
thou
go
with
me
against
moab
to
battle
and
he
said
i
will
go
up
i
am
as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people
and
my
horses
as
thy
horses
and
he
said
which
way
shall
we
go
up
and
he
answered
the
way
through
the
wilderness
of
edom
so
the
king
of
israel
went
and
the
king
of
judah
and
the
king
of
edom
and
they
fetched
a
compass
of
seven
days
journey
and
there
was
no
water
for
the
host
and
for
the
cattle
that
followed
them
and
the
king
of
israel
said
alas
that
the
lord
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
moab
but
jehoshaphat
said
is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
the
lord
that
we
may
enquire
of
the
lord
by
him
and
one
of
the
king
of
israel's
servants
answered
and
said
here
is
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
which
poured
water
on
the
hands
of
elijah
and
jehoshaphat
said
the
word
of
the
lord
is
with
him
so
the
king
of
israel
and
jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
edom
went
down
to
him
and
elisha
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
get
thee
to
the
prophets
of
thy
father
and
to
the
prophets
of
thy
mother
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
him
nay
for
the
lord
hath
called
these
three
kings
together
to
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
moab
and
elisha
said
as
the
lord
of
hosts
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
surely
were
it
not
that
i
regard
the
presence
of
jehoshaphat
the
king
of
judah
i
would
not
look
toward
thee
nor
see
thee
but
now
bring
me
a
minstrel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
minstrel
played
that
the
hand
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
make
this
valley
full
of
ditches
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
see
wind
neither
shall
ye
see
rain
yet
that
valley
shall
be
filled
with
water
that
ye
may
drink
both
ye
and
your
cattle
and
your
beasts
and
this
is
but
a
light
thing
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
he
will
deliver
the
moabites
also
into
your
hand
and
ye
shall
smite
every
fenced
city
and
every
choice
city
and
shall
fell
every
good
tree
and
stop
all
wells
of
water
and
mar
every
good
piece
of
land
with
stones
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
when
the
meat
offering
was
offered
that
behold
there
came
water
by
the
way
of
edom
and
the
country
was
filled
with
water
and
when
all
the
moabites
heard
that
the
kings
were
come
up
to
fight
against
them
they
gathered
all
that
were
able
to
put
on
armour
and
upward
and
stood
in
the
border
and
they
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
water
and
the
moabites
saw
the
water
on
the
other
side
as
red
as
blood
and
they
said
this
is
blood
the
kings
are
surely
slain
and
they
have
smitten
one
another
now
therefore
moab
to
the
spoil
and
when
they
came
to
the
camp
of
israel
the
israelites
rose
up
and
smote
the
moabites
so
that
they
fled
before
them
but
they
went
forward
smiting
the
moabites
even
in
their
country
and
they
beat
down
the
cities
and
on
every
good
piece
of
land
cast
every
man
his
stone
and
filled
it
and
they
stopped
all
the
wells
of
water
and
felled
all
the
good
trees
only
in
kirharaseth
left
they
the
stones
thereof
howbeit
the
slingers
went
about
it
and
smote
it
and
when
the
king
of
moab
saw
that
the
battle
was
too
sore
for
him
he
took
with
him
seven
hundred
men
that
drew
swords
to
break
through
even
unto
the
king
of
edom
but
they
could
not
then
he
took
his
eldest
son
that
should
have
reigned
in
his
stead
and
offered
him
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
the
wall
and
there
was
great
indignation
against
israel
and
they
departed
from
him
and
returned
to
their
own
land
now
there
cried
a
certain
woman
of
the
wives
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
unto
elisha
saying
thy
servant
my
husband
is
dead
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
servant
did
fear
the
lord
and
the
creditor
is
come
to
take
unto
him
my
two
sons
to
be
bondmen
and
elisha
said
unto
her
what
shall
i
do
for
thee
tell
me
what
hast
thou
in
the
house
and
she
said
thine
handmaid
hath
not
any
thing
in
the
house
save
a
pot
of
oil
then
he
said
go
borrow
thee
vessels
abroad
of
all
thy
neighbours
even
empty
vessels
borrow
not
a
few
and
when
thou
art
come
in
thou
shalt
shut
the
door
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
sons
and
shalt
pour
out
into
all
those
vessels
and
thou
shalt
set
aside
that
which
is
full
so
she
went
from
him
and
shut
the
door
upon
her
and
upon
her
sons
who
brought
the
vessels
to
her
and
she
poured
out
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
vessels
were
full
that
she
said
unto
her
son
bring
me
yet
a
vessel
and
he
said
unto
her
there
is
not
a
vessel
more
and
the
oil
stayed
then
she
came
and
told
the
man
of
god
and
he
said
go
sell
the
oil
and
pay
thy
debt
and
live
thou
and
thy
children
of
the
rest
and
it
fell
on
a
day
that
elisha
passed
to
shunem
where
was
a
great
woman
and
she
constrained
him
to
eat
bread
and
so
it
was
that
as
oft
as
he
passed
by
he
turned
in
thither
to
eat
bread
and
she
said
unto
her
husband
behold
now
i
perceive
that
this
is
an
holy
man
of
god
which
passeth
by
us
continually
let
us
make
a
little
chamber
i
pray
thee
on
the
wall
and
let
us
set
for
him
there
a
bed
and
a
table
and
a
stool
and
a
candlestick
and
it
shall
be
when
he
cometh
to
us
that
he
shall
turn
in
thither
and
it
fell
on
a
day
that
he
came
thither
and
he
turned
into
the
chamber
and
lay
there
and
he
said
to
gehazi
his
servant
call
this
shunammite
and
when
he
had
called
her
she
stood
before
him
and
he
said
unto
him
say
now
unto
her
behold
thou
hast
been
careful
for
us
with
all
this
care
what
is
to
be
done
for
thee
wouldest
thou
be
spoken
for
to
the
king
or
to
the
captain
of
the
host
and
she
answered
i
dwell
among
mine
own
people
and
he
said
what
then
is
to
be
done
for
her
and
gehazi
answered
verily
she
hath
no
child
and
her
husband
is
old
and
he
said
call
her
and
when
he
had
called
her
she
stood
in
the
door
and
he
said
about
this
season
according
to
the
time
of
life
thou
shalt
embrace
a
son
and
she
said
nay
my
lord
thou
man
of
god
do
not
lie
unto
thine
handmaid
and
the
woman
conceived
and
bare
a
son
at
that
season
that
elisha
had
said
unto
her
according
to
the
time
of
life
and
when
the
child
was
grown
it
fell
on
a
day
that
he
went
out
to
his
father
to
the
reapers
and
he
said
unto
his
father
my
head
my
head
and
he
said
to
a
lad
carry
him
to
his
mother
and
when
he
had
taken
him
and
brought
him
to
his
mother
he
sat
on
her
knees
till
noon
and
then
died
and
she
went
up
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
of
the
man
of
god
and
shut
the
door
upon
him
and
went
out
and
she
called
unto
her
husband
and
said
send
me
i
pray
thee
one
of
the
young
men
and
one
of
the
asses
that
i
may
run
to
the
man
of
god
and
come
again
and
he
said
wherefore
wilt
thou
go
to
him
to
day
it
is
neither
new
moon
nor
sabbath
and
she
said
it
shall
be
well
then
she
saddled
an
ass
and
said
to
her
servant
drive
and
go
forward
slack
not
thy
riding
for
me
except
i
bid
thee
so
she
went
and
came
unto
the
man
of
god
to
mount
carmel
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
man
of
god
saw
her
afar
off
that
he
said
to
gehazi
his
servant
behold
yonder
is
that
shunammite
run
now
i
pray
thee
to
meet
her
and
say
unto
her
is
it
well
with
thee
is
it
well
with
thy
husband
is
it
well
with
the
child
and
she
answered
it
is
well
and
when
she
came
to
the
man
of
god
to
the
hill
she
caught
him
by
the
feet
but
gehazi
came
near
to
thrust
her
away
and
the
man
of
god
said
let
her
alone
for
her
soul
is
vexed
within
her
and
the
lord
hath
hid
it
from
me
and
hath
not
told
me
then
she
said
did
i
desire
a
son
of
my
lord
did
i
not
say
do
not
deceive
me
then
he
said
to
gehazi
gird
up
thy
loins
and
take
my
staff
in
thine
hand
and
go
thy
way
if
thou
meet
any
man
salute
him
not
and
if
any
salute
thee
answer
him
not
again
and
lay
my
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child
and
the
mother
of
the
child
said
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
thy
soul
liveth
i
will
not
leave
thee
and
he
arose
and
followed
her
and
gehazi
passed
on
before
them
and
laid
the
staff
upon
the
face
of
the
child
but
there
was
neither
voice
nor
hearing
wherefore
he
went
again
to
meet
him
and
told
him
saying
the
child
is
not
awaked
and
when
elisha
was
come
into
the
house
behold
the
child
was
dead
and
laid
upon
his
bed
he
went
in
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
he
went
up
and
lay
upon
the
child
and
put
his
mouth
upon
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
upon
his
eyes
and
his
hands
upon
his
hands
and
stretched
himself
upon
the
child
and
the
flesh
of
the
child
waxed
warm
then
he
returned
and
walked
in
the
house
to
and
fro
and
went
up
and
stretched
himself
upon
him
and
the
child
sneezed
seven
times
and
the
child
opened
his
eyes
and
he
called
gehazi
and
said
call
this
shunammite
so
he
called
her
and
when
she
was
come
in
unto
him
he
said
take
up
thy
son
then
she
went
in
and
fell
at
his
feet
and
bowed
herself
to
the
ground
and
took
up
her
son
and
went
out
and
elisha
came
again
to
gilgal
and
there
was
a
dearth
in
the
land
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
were
sitting
before
him
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
set
on
the
great
pot
and
seethe
pottage
for
the
sons
of
the
prophets
and
one
went
out
into
the
field
to
gather
herbs
and
found
a
wild
vine
and
gathered
thereof
wild
gourds
his
lap
full
and
came
and
shred
them
into
the
pot
of
pottage
for
they
knew
them
not
so
they
poured
out
for
the
men
to
eat
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
were
eating
of
the
pottage
that
they
cried
out
and
said
o
thou
man
of
god
there
is
death
in
the
pot
and
they
could
not
eat
thereof
but
he
said
then
bring
meal
and
he
cast
it
into
the
pot
and
he
said
pour
out
for
the
people
that
they
may
eat
and
there
was
no
harm
in
the
pot
and
there
came
a
man
from
baalshalisha
and
brought
the
man
of
god
bread
of
the
firstfruits
twenty
loaves
of
barley
and
full
ears
of
corn
in
the
husk
thereof
and
he
said
give
unto
the
people
that
they
may
eat
and
his
servitor
said
what
should
i
set
this
before
an
hundred
men
he
said
again
give
the
people
that
they
may
eat
for
thus
saith
the
lord
they
shall
eat
and
shall
leave
thereof
so
he
set
it
before
them
and
they
did
eat
and
left
thereof
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
now
naaman
captain
of
the
host
of
the
king
of
syria
was
a
great
man
with
his
master
and
honourable
because
by
him
the
lord
had
given
deliverance
unto
syria
he
was
also
a
mighty
man
in
valour
but
he
was
a
leper
and
the
syrians
had
gone
out
by
companies
and
had
brought
away
captive
out
of
the
land
of
israel
a
little
maid
and
she
waited
on
naaman's
wife
and
she
said
unto
her
mistress
would
god
my
lord
were
with
the
prophet
that
is
in
samaria
for
he
would
recover
him
of
his
leprosy
and
one
went
in
and
told
his
lord
saying
thus
and
thus
said
the
maid
that
is
of
the
land
of
israel
and
the
king
of
syria
said
go
to
go
and
i
will
send
a
letter
unto
the
king
of
israel
and
he
departed
and
took
with
him
ten
talents
of
silver
and
six
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
ten
changes
of
raiment
and
he
brought
the
letter
to
the
king
of
israel
saying
now
when
this
letter
is
come
unto
thee
behold
i
have
therewith
sent
naaman
my
servant
to
thee
that
thou
mayest
recover
him
of
his
leprosy
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
of
israel
had
read
the
letter
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
said
am
i
god
to
kill
and
to
make
alive
that
this
man
doth
send
unto
me
to
recover
a
man
of
his
leprosy
wherefore
consider
i
pray
you
and
see
how
he
seeketh
a
quarrel
against
me
and
it
was
so
when
elisha
the
man
of
god
had
heard
that
the
king
of
israel
had
rent
his
clothes
that
he
sent
to
the
king
saying
wherefore
hast
thou
rent
thy
clothes
let
him
come
now
to
me
and
he
shall
know
that
there
is
a
prophet
in
israel
so
naaman
came
with
his
horses
and
with
his
chariot
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
elisha
and
elisha
sent
a
messenger
unto
him
saying
go
and
wash
in
jordan
seven
times
and
thy
flesh
shall
come
again
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
clean
but
naaman
was
wroth
and
went
away
and
said
behold
i
thought
he
will
surely
come
out
to
me
and
stand
and
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
and
strike
his
hand
over
the
place
and
recover
the
leper
are
not
abana
and
pharpar
rivers
of
damascus
better
than
all
the
waters
of
israel
may
i
not
wash
in
them
and
be
clean
so
he
turned
and
went
away
in
a
rage
and
his
servants
came
near
and
spake
unto
him
and
said
my
father
if
the
prophet
had
bid
thee
do
some
great
thing
wouldest
thou
not
have
done
it
how
much
rather
then
when
he
saith
to
thee
wash
and
be
clean
then
went
he
down
and
dipped
himself
seven
times
in
jordan
according
to
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
and
his
flesh
came
again
like
unto
the
flesh
of
a
little
child
and
he
was
clean
and
he
returned
to
the
man
of
god
he
and
all
his
company
and
came
and
stood
before
him
and
he
said
behold
now
i
know
that
there
is
no
god
in
all
the
earth
but
in
israel
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
take
a
blessing
of
thy
servant
but
he
said
as
the
lord
liveth
before
whom
i
stand
i
will
receive
none
and
he
urged
him
to
take
it
but
he
refused
and
naaman
said
shall
there
not
then
i
pray
thee
be
given
to
thy
servant
two
mules
burden
of
earth
for
thy
servant
will
henceforth
offer
neither
burnt
offering
nor
sacrifice
unto
other
gods
but
unto
the
lord
in
this
thing
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
that
when
my
master
goeth
into
the
house
of
rimmon
to
worship
there
and
he
leaneth
on
my
hand
and
i
bow
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
when
i
bow
down
myself
in
the
house
of
rimmon
the
lord
pardon
thy
servant
in
this
thing
and
he
said
unto
him
go
in
peace
so
he
departed
from
him
a
little
way
but
gehazi
the
servant
of
elisha
the
man
of
god
said
behold
my
master
hath
spared
naaman
this
syrian
in
not
receiving
at
his
hands
that
which
he
brought
but
as
the
lord
liveth
i
will
run
after
him
and
take
somewhat
of
him
so
gehazi
followed
after
naaman
and
when
naaman
saw
him
running
after
him
he
lighted
down
from
the
chariot
to
meet
him
and
said
is
all
well
and
he
said
all
is
well
my
master
hath
sent
me
saying
behold
even
now
there
be
come
to
me
from
mount
ephraim
two
young
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
give
them
i
pray
thee
a
talent
of
silver
and
two
changes
of
garments
and
naaman
said
be
content
take
two
talents
and
he
urged
him
and
bound
two
talents
of
silver
in
two
bags
with
two
changes
of
garments
and
laid
them
upon
two
of
his
servants
and
they
bare
them
before
him
and
when
he
came
to
the
tower
he
took
them
from
their
hand
and
bestowed
them
in
the
house
and
he
let
the
men
go
and
they
departed
but
he
went
in
and
stood
before
his
master
and
elisha
said
unto
him
whence
comest
thou
gehazi
and
he
said
thy
servant
went
no
whither
and
he
said
unto
him
went
not
mine
heart
with
thee
when
the
man
turned
again
from
his
chariot
to
meet
thee
is
it
a
time
to
receive
money
and
to
receive
garments
and
oliveyards
and
vineyards
and
sheep
and
oxen
and
menservants
and
maidservants
the
leprosy
therefore
of
naaman
shall
cleave
unto
thee
and
unto
thy
seed
for
ever
and
he
went
out
from
his
presence
a
leper
as
white
as
snow
and
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
unto
elisha
behold
now
the
place
where
we
dwell
with
thee
is
too
strait
for
us
let
us
go
we
pray
thee
unto
jordan
and
take
thence
every
man
a
beam
and
let
us
make
us
a
place
there
where
we
may
dwell
and
he
answered
go
ye
and
one
said
be
content
i
pray
thee
and
go
with
thy
servants
and
he
answered
i
will
go
so
he
went
with
them
and
when
they
came
to
jordan
they
cut
down
wood
but
as
one
was
felling
a
beam
the
axe
head
fell
into
the
water
and
he
cried
and
said
alas
master
for
it
was
borrowed
and
the
man
of
god
said
where
fell
it
and
he
shewed
him
the
place
and
he
cut
down
a
stick
and
cast
it
in
thither
and
the
iron
did
swim
therefore
said
he
take
it
up
to
thee
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
it
then
the
king
of
syria
warred
against
israel
and
took
counsel
with
his
servants
saying
in
such
and
such
a
place
shall
be
my
camp
and
the
man
of
god
sent
unto
the
king
of
israel
saying
beware
that
thou
pass
not
such
a
place
for
thither
the
syrians
are
come
down
and
the
king
of
israel
sent
to
the
place
which
the
man
of
god
told
him
and
warned
him
of
and
saved
himself
there
not
once
nor
twice
therefore
the
heart
of
the
king
of
syria
was
sore
troubled
for
this
thing
and
he
called
his
servants
and
said
unto
them
will
ye
not
shew
me
which
of
us
is
for
the
king
of
israel
and
one
of
his
servants
said
none
my
lord
o
king
but
elisha
the
prophet
that
is
in
israel
telleth
the
king
of
israel
the
words
that
thou
speakest
in
thy
bedchamber
and
he
said
go
and
spy
where
he
is
that
i
may
send
and
fetch
him
and
it
was
told
him
saying
behold
he
is
in
dothan
therefore
sent
he
thither
horses
and
chariots
and
a
great
host
and
they
came
by
night
and
compassed
the
city
about
and
when
the
servant
of
the
man
of
god
was
risen
early
and
gone
forth
behold
an
host
compassed
the
city
both
with
horses
and
chariots
and
his
servant
said
unto
him
alas
my
master
how
shall
we
do
and
he
answered
fear
not
for
they
that
be
with
us
are
more
than
they
that
be
with
them
and
elisha
prayed
and
said
lord
i
pray
thee
open
his
eyes
that
he
may
see
and
the
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
and
he
saw
and
behold
the
mountain
was
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
round
about
elisha
and
when
they
came
down
to
him
elisha
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
said
smite
this
people
i
pray
thee
with
blindness
and
he
smote
them
with
blindness
according
to
the
word
of
elisha
and
elisha
said
unto
them
this
is
not
the
way
neither
is
this
the
city
follow
me
and
i
will
bring
you
to
the
man
whom
ye
seek
but
he
led
them
to
samaria
and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
come
into
samaria
that
elisha
said
lord
open
the
eyes
of
these
men
that
they
may
see
and
the
lord
opened
their
eyes
and
they
saw
and
behold
they
were
in
the
midst
of
samaria
and
the
king
of
israel
said
unto
elisha
when
he
saw
them
my
father
shall
i
smite
them
shall
i
smite
them
and
he
answered
thou
shalt
not
smite
them
wouldest
thou
smite
those
whom
thou
hast
taken
captive
with
thy
sword
and
with
thy
bow
set
bread
and
water
before
them
that
they
may
eat
and
drink
and
go
to
their
master
and
he
prepared
great
provision
for
them
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
he
sent
them
away
and
they
went
to
their
master
so
the
bands
of
syria
came
no
more
into
the
land
of
israel
and
it
came
to
pass
after
this
that
benhadad
king
of
syria
gathered
all
his
host
and
went
up
and
besieged
samaria
and
there
was
a
great
famine
in
samaria
and
behold
they
besieged
it
until
an
ass's
head
was
sold
for
fourscore
pieces
of
silver
and
the
fourth
part
of
a
cab
of
dove's
dung
for
five
pieces
of
silver
and
as
the
king
of
israel
was
passing
by
upon
the
wall
there
cried
a
woman
unto
him
saying
help
my
lord
o
king
and
he
said
if
the
lord
do
not
help
thee
whence
shall
i
help
thee
out
of
the
barnfloor
or
out
of
the
winepress
and
the
king
said
unto
her
what
aileth
thee
and
she
answered
this
woman
said
unto
me
give
thy
son
that
we
may
eat
him
to
day
and
we
will
eat
my
son
to
morrow
so
we
boiled
my
son
and
did
eat
him
and
i
said
unto
her
on
the
next
day
give
thy
son
that
we
may
eat
him
and
she
hath
hid
her
son
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
woman
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
he
passed
by
upon
the
wall
and
the
people
looked
and
behold
he
had
sackcloth
within
upon
his
flesh
then
he
said
god
do
so
and
more
also
to
me
if
the
head
of
elisha
the
son
of
shaphat
shall
stand
on
him
this
day
but
elisha
sat
in
his
house
and
the
elders
sat
with
him
and
the
king
sent
a
man
from
before
him
but
ere
the
messenger
came
to
him
he
said
to
the
elders
see
ye
how
this
son
of
a
murderer
hath
sent
to
take
away
mine
head
look
when
the
messenger
cometh
shut
the
door
and
hold
him
fast
at
the
door
is
not
the
sound
of
his
master's
feet
behind
him
and
while
he
yet
talked
with
them
behold
the
messenger
came
down
unto
him
and
he
said
behold
this
evil
is
of
the
lord
what
should
i
wait
for
the
lord
any
longer
then
elisha
said
hear
ye
the
word
of
the
lord
thus
saith
the
lord
to
morrow
about
this
time
shall
a
measure
of
fine
flour
be
sold
for
a
shekel
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
in
the
gate
of
samaria
then
a
lord
on
whose
hand
the
king
leaned
answered
the
man
of
god
and
said
behold
if
the
lord
would
make
windows
in
heaven
might
this
thing
be
and
he
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof
and
there
were
four
leprous
men
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
and
they
said
one
to
another
why
sit
we
here
until
we
die
if
we
say
we
will
enter
into
the
city
then
the
famine
is
in
the
city
and
we
shall
die
there
and
if
we
sit
still
here
we
die
also
now
therefore
come
and
let
us
fall
unto
the
host
of
the
syrians
if
they
save
us
alive
we
shall
live
and
if
they
kill
us
we
shall
but
die
and
they
rose
up
in
the
twilight
to
go
unto
the
camp
of
the
syrians
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp
of
syria
behold
there
was
no
man
there
for
the
lord
had
made
the
host
of
the
syrians
to
hear
a
noise
of
chariots
and
a
noise
of
horses
even
the
noise
of
a
great
host
and
they
said
one
to
another
lo
the
king
of
israel
hath
hired
against
us
the
kings
of
the
hittites
and
the
kings
of
the
egyptians
to
come
upon
us
wherefore
they
arose
and
fled
in
the
twilight
and
left
their
tents
and
their
horses
and
their
asses
even
the
camp
as
it
was
and
fled
for
their
life
and
when
these
lepers
came
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
camp
they
went
into
one
tent
and
did
eat
and
drink
and
carried
thence
silver
and
gold
and
raiment
and
went
and
hid
it
and
came
again
and
entered
into
another
tent
and
carried
thence
also
and
went
and
hid
it
then
they
said
one
to
another
we
do
not
well
this
day
is
a
day
of
good
tidings
and
we
hold
our
peace
if
we
tarry
till
the
morning
light
some
mischief
will
come
upon
us
now
therefore
come
that
we
may
go
and
tell
the
king's
household
so
they
came
and
called
unto
the
porter
of
the
city
and
they
told
them
saying
we
came
to
the
camp
of
the
syrians
and
behold
there
was
no
man
there
neither
voice
of
man
but
horses
tied
and
asses
tied
and
the
tents
as
they
were
and
he
called
the
porters
and
they
told
it
to
the
king's
house
within
and
the
king
arose
in
the
night
and
said
unto
his
servants
i
will
now
shew
you
what
the
syrians
have
done
to
us
they
know
that
we
be
hungry
therefore
are
they
gone
out
of
the
camp
to
hide
themselves
in
the
field
saying
when
they
come
out
of
the
city
we
shall
catch
them
alive
and
get
into
the
city
and
one
of
his
servants
answered
and
said
let
some
take
i
pray
thee
five
of
the
horses
that
remain
which
are
left
in
the
city
behold
they
are
as
all
the
multitude
of
israel
that
are
left
in
it
behold
i
say
they
are
even
as
all
the
multitude
of
the
israelites
that
are
consumed
and
let
us
send
and
see
they
took
therefore
two
chariot
horses
and
the
king
sent
after
the
host
of
the
syrians
saying
go
and
see
and
they
went
after
them
unto
jordan
and
lo
all
the
way
was
full
of
garments
and
vessels
which
the
syrians
had
cast
away
in
their
haste
and
the
messengers
returned
and
told
the
king
and
the
people
went
out
and
spoiled
the
tents
of
the
syrians
so
a
measure
of
fine
flour
was
sold
for
a
shekel
and
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
king
appointed
the
lord
on
whose
hand
he
leaned
to
have
the
charge
of
the
gate
and
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate
and
he
died
as
the
man
of
god
had
said
who
spake
when
the
king
came
down
to
him
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
man
of
god
had
spoken
to
the
king
saying
two
measures
of
barley
for
a
shekel
and
a
measure
of
fine
flour
for
a
shekel
shall
be
to
morrow
about
this
time
in
the
gate
of
samaria
and
that
lord
answered
the
man
of
god
and
said
now
behold
if
the
lord
should
make
windows
in
heaven
might
such
a
thing
be
and
he
said
behold
thou
shalt
see
it
with
thine
eyes
but
shalt
not
eat
thereof
and
so
it
fell
out
unto
him
for
the
people
trode
upon
him
in
the
gate
and
he
died
then
spake
elisha
unto
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
saying
arise
and
go
thou
and
thine
household
and
sojourn
wheresoever
thou
canst
sojourn
for
the
lord
hath
called
for
a
famine
and
it
shall
also
come
upon
the
land
seven
years
and
the
woman
arose
and
did
after
the
saying
of
the
man
of
god
and
she
went
with
her
household
and
sojourned
in
the
land
of
the
philistines
seven
years
and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
seven
years
end
that
the
woman
returned
out
of
the
land
of
the
philistines
and
she
went
forth
to
cry
unto
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land
and
the
king
talked
with
gehazi
the
servant
of
the
man
of
god
saying
tell
me
i
pray
thee
all
the
great
things
that
elisha
hath
done
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
telling
the
king
how
he
had
restored
a
dead
body
to
life
that
behold
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
cried
to
the
king
for
her
house
and
for
her
land
and
gehazi
said
my
lord
o
king
this
is
the
woman
and
this
is
her
son
whom
elisha
restored
to
life
and
when
the
king
asked
the
woman
she
told
him
so
the
king
appointed
unto
her
a
certain
officer
saying
restore
all
that
was
hers
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
field
since
the
day
that
she
left
the
land
even
until
now
and
elisha
came
to
damascus
and
benhadad
the
king
of
syria
was
sick
and
it
was
told
him
saying
the
man
of
god
is
come
hither
and
the
king
said
unto
hazael
take
a
present
in
thine
hand
and
go
meet
the
man
of
god
and
enquire
of
the
lord
by
him
saying
shall
i
recover
of
this
disease
so
hazael
went
to
meet
him
and
took
a
present
with
him
even
of
every
good
thing
of
damascus
forty
camels
burden
and
came
and
stood
before
him
and
said
thy
son
benhadad
king
of
syria
hath
sent
me
to
thee
saying
shall
i
recover
of
this
disease
and
elisha
said
unto
him
go
say
unto
him
thou
mayest
certainly
recover
howbeit
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
that
he
shall
surely
die
and
he
settled
his
countenance
stedfastly
until
he
was
ashamed
and
the
man
of
god
wept
and
hazael
said
why
weepeth
my
lord
and
he
answered
because
i
know
the
evil
that
thou
wilt
do
unto
the
children
of
israel
their
strong
holds
wilt
thou
set
on
fire
and
their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay
with
the
sword
and
wilt
dash
their
children
and
rip
up
their
women
with
child
and
hazael
said
but
what
is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
great
thing
and
elisha
answered
the
lord
hath
shewed
me
that
thou
shalt
be
king
over
syria
so
he
departed
from
elisha
and
came
to
his
master
who
said
to
him
what
said
elisha
to
thee
and
he
answered
he
told
me
that
thou
shouldest
surely
recover
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
he
took
a
thick
cloth
and
dipped
it
in
water
and
spread
it
on
his
face
so
that
he
died
and
hazael
reigned
in
his
stead
and
in
the
fifth
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
jehoshaphat
being
then
king
of
judah
jehoram
the
son
of
je
hoshaphat
king
of
judah
began
to
reign
thirty
and
two
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
eight
years
in
jerusalem
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
the
daughter
of
ahab
was
his
wife
and
he
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yet
the
lord
would
not
destroy
judah
for
david
his
servant's
sake
as
he
promised
him
to
give
him
alway
a
light
and
to
his
children
in
his
days
edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
and
made
a
king
over
themselves
so
joram
went
over
to
zair
and
all
the
chariots
with
him
and
he
rose
by
night
and
smote
the
edomites
which
compassed
him
about
and
the
captains
of
the
chariots
and
the
people
fled
into
their
tents
yet
edom
revolted
from
under
the
hand
of
judah
unto
this
day
then
libnah
revolted
at
the
same
time
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
joram
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
joram
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
ahaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
twelfth
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
king
of
israel
did
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
begin
to
reign
two
and
twenty
years
old
was
ahaziah
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
one
year
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
athaliah
the
daughter
of
omri
king
of
israel
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
did
the
house
of
ahab
for
he
was
the
son
in
law
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
he
went
with
joram
the
son
of
ahab
to
the
war
against
hazael
king
of
syria
in
ramothgilead
and
the
syrians
wounded
joram
and
king
joram
went
back
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
syrians
had
given
him
at
ramah
when
he
fought
against
hazael
king
of
syria
and
ahaziah
the
son
of
jehoram
king
of
judah
went
down
to
see
joram
the
son
of
ahab
in
jezreel
because
he
was
sick
and
elisha
the
prophet
called
one
of
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
said
unto
him
gird
up
thy
loins
and
take
this
box
of
oil
in
thine
hand
and
go
to
ramothgilead
and
when
thou
comest
thither
look
out
there
jehu
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
nimshi
and
go
in
and
make
him
arise
up
from
among
his
brethren
and
carry
him
to
an
inner
chamber
then
take
the
box
of
oil
and
pour
it
on
his
head
and
say
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
then
open
the
door
and
flee
and
tarry
not
so
the
young
man
even
the
young
man
the
prophet
went
to
ramothgilead
and
when
he
came
behold
the
captains
of
the
host
were
sitting
and
he
said
i
have
an
errand
to
thee
o
captain
and
jehu
said
unto
which
of
all
us
and
he
said
to
thee
o
captain
and
he
arose
and
went
into
the
house
and
he
poured
the
oil
on
his
head
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
the
people
of
the
lord
even
over
israel
and
thou
shalt
smite
the
house
of
ahab
thy
master
that
i
may
avenge
the
blood
of
my
servants
the
prophets
and
the
blood
of
all
the
servants
of
the
lord
at
the
hand
of
jezebel
for
the
whole
house
of
ahab
shall
perish
and
i
will
cut
off
from
ahab
him
that
pisseth
against
the
wall
and
him
that
is
shut
up
and
left
in
israel
and
i
will
make
the
house
of
ahab
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
and
like
the
house
of
baasha
the
son
of
ahijah
and
the
dogs
shall
eat
jezebel
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
and
there
shall
be
none
to
bury
her
and
he
opened
the
door
and
fled
then
jehu
came
forth
to
the
servants
of
his
lord
and
one
said
unto
him
is
all
well
wherefore
came
this
mad
fellow
to
thee
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
the
man
and
his
communication
and
they
said
it
is
false
tell
us
now
and
he
said
thus
and
thus
spake
he
to
me
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
then
they
hasted
and
took
every
man
his
garment
and
put
it
under
him
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
blew
with
trumpets
saying
jehu
is
king
so
jehu
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
the
son
of
nimshi
conspired
against
joram
now
joram
had
kept
ramothgilead
he
and
all
israel
because
of
hazael
king
of
syria
but
king
joram
was
returned
to
be
healed
in
jezreel
of
the
wounds
which
the
syrians
had
given
him
when
he
fought
with
hazael
king
of
syria
and
jehu
said
if
it
be
your
minds
then
let
none
go
forth
nor
escape
out
of
the
city
to
go
to
tell
it
in
jezreel
so
jehu
rode
in
a
chariot
and
went
to
jezreel
for
joram
lay
there
and
ahaziah
king
of
judah
was
come
down
to
see
joram
and
there
stood
a
watchman
on
the
tower
in
jezreel
and
he
spied
the
company
of
jehu
as
he
came
and
said
i
see
a
company
and
joram
said
take
an
horseman
and
send
to
meet
them
and
let
him
say
is
it
peace
so
there
went
one
on
horseback
to
meet
him
and
said
thus
saith
the
king
is
it
peace
and
jehu
said
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
me
and
the
watchman
told
saying
the
messenger
came
to
them
but
he
cometh
not
again
then
he
sent
out
a
second
on
horseback
which
came
to
them
and
said
thus
saith
the
king
is
it
peace
and
jehu
answered
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
peace
turn
thee
behind
me
and
the
watchman
told
saying
he
came
even
unto
them
and
cometh
not
again
and
the
driving
is
like
the
driving
of
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
for
he
driveth
furiously
and
joram
said
make
ready
and
his
chariot
was
made
ready
and
joram
king
of
israel
and
ahaziah
king
of
judah
went
out
each
in
his
chariot
and
they
went
out
against
jehu
and
met
him
in
the
portion
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
and
it
came
to
pass
when
joram
saw
jehu
that
he
said
is
it
peace
jehu
and
he
answered
what
peace
so
long
as
the
whoredoms
of
thy
mother
jezebel
and
her
witchcrafts
are
so
many
and
joram
turned
his
hands
and
fled
and
said
to
ahaziah
there
is
treachery
o
ahaziah
and
jehu
drew
a
bow
with
his
full
strength
and
smote
jehoram
between
his
arms
and
the
arrow
went
out
at
his
heart
and
he
sunk
down
in
his
chariot
then
said
jehu
to
bidkar
his
captain
take
up
and
cast
him
in
the
portion
of
the
field
of
naboth
the
jezreelite
for
remember
how
that
when
i
and
thou
rode
together
after
ahab
his
father
the
lord
laid
this
burden
upon
him
surely
i
have
seen
yesterday
the
blood
of
naboth
and
the
blood
of
his
sons
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
requite
thee
in
this
plat
saith
the
lord
now
therefore
take
and
cast
him
into
the
plat
of
ground
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
but
when
ahaziah
the
king
of
judah
saw
this
he
fled
by
the
way
of
the
garden
house
and
jehu
followed
after
him
and
said
smite
him
also
in
the
chariot
and
they
did
so
at
the
going
up
to
gur
which
is
by
ibleam
and
he
fled
to
megiddo
and
died
there
and
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
to
jerusalem
and
buried
him
in
his
sepulchre
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
in
the
eleventh
year
of
joram
the
son
of
ahab
began
ahaziah
to
reign
over
judah
and
when
jehu
was
come
to
jezreel
jezebel
heard
of
it
and
she
painted
her
face
and
tired
her
head
and
looked
out
at
a
window
and
as
jehu
entered
in
at
the
gate
she
said
had
zimri
peace
who
slew
his
master
and
he
lifted
up
his
face
to
the
window
and
said
who
is
on
my
side
who
and
there
looked
out
to
him
two
or
three
eunuchs
and
he
said
throw
her
down
so
they
threw
her
down
and
some
of
her
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
wall
and
on
the
horses
and
he
trode
her
under
foot
and
when
he
was
come
in
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
said
go
see
now
this
cursed
woman
and
bury
her
for
she
is
a
king's
daughter
and
they
went
to
bury
her
but
they
found
no
more
of
her
than
the
skull
and
the
feet
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
wherefore
they
came
again
and
told
him
and
he
said
this
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
elijah
the
tishbite
saying
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
shall
dogs
eat
the
flesh
of
jezebel
and
the
carcase
of
jezebel
shall
be
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
field
in
the
portion
of
jezreel
so
that
they
shall
not
say
this
is
jezebel
and
ahab
had
seventy
sons
in
samaria
and
jehu
wrote
letters
and
sent
to
samaria
unto
the
rulers
of
jezreel
to
the
elders
and
to
them
that
brought
up
ahab's
children
saying
now
as
soon
as
this
letter
cometh
to
you
seeing
your
master's
sons
are
with
you
and
there
are
with
you
chariots
and
horses
a
fenced
city
also
and
armour
look
even
out
the
best
and
meetest
of
your
master's
sons
and
set
him
on
his
father's
throne
and
fight
for
your
master's
house
but
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
and
said
behold
two
kings
stood
not
before
him
how
then
shall
we
stand
and
he
that
was
over
the
house
and
he
that
was
over
the
city
the
elders
also
and
the
bringers
up
of
the
children
sent
to
jehu
saying
we
are
thy
servants
and
will
do
all
that
thou
shalt
bid
us
we
will
not
make
any
king
do
thou
that
which
is
good
in
thine
eyes
then
he
wrote
a
letter
the
second
time
to
them
saying
if
ye
be
mine
and
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
my
voice
take
ye
the
heads
of
the
men
your
master's
sons
and
come
to
me
to
jezreel
by
to
morrow
this
time
now
the
king's
sons
being
seventy
persons
were
with
the
great
men
of
the
city
which
brought
them
up
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
letter
came
to
them
that
they
took
the
king's
sons
and
slew
seventy
persons
and
put
their
heads
in
baskets
and
sent
him
them
to
jezreel
and
there
came
a
messenger
and
told
him
saying
they
have
brought
the
heads
of
the
king's
sons
and
he
said
lay
ye
them
in
two
heaps
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
until
the
morning
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
morning
that
he
went
out
and
stood
and
said
to
all
the
people
ye
be
righteous
behold
i
conspired
against
my
master
and
slew
him
but
who
slew
all
these
know
now
that
there
shall
fall
unto
the
earth
nothing
of
the
word
of
the
lord
which
the
lord
spake
concerning
the
house
of
ahab
for
the
lord
hath
done
that
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
elijah
so
jehu
slew
all
that
remained
of
the
house
of
ahab
in
jezreel
and
all
his
great
men
and
his
kinsfolks
and
his
priests
until
he
left
him
none
remaining
and
he
arose
and
departed
and
came
to
samaria
and
as
he
was
at
the
shearing
house
in
the
way
jehu
met
with
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
king
of
judah
and
said
who
are
ye
and
they
answered
we
are
the
brethren
of
ahaziah
and
we
go
down
to
salute
the
children
of
the
king
and
the
children
of
the
queen
and
he
said
take
them
alive
and
they
took
them
alive
and
slew
them
at
the
pit
of
the
shearing
house
even
two
and
forty
men
neither
left
he
any
of
them
and
when
he
was
departed
thence
he
lighted
on
jehonadab
the
son
of
rechab
coming
to
meet
him
and
he
saluted
him
and
said
to
him
is
thine
heart
right
as
my
heart
is
with
thy
heart
and
jehonadab
answered
it
is
if
it
be
give
me
thine
hand
and
he
gave
him
his
hand
and
he
took
him
up
to
him
into
the
chariot
and
he
said
come
with
me
and
see
my
zeal
for
the
lord
so
they
made
him
ride
in
his
chariot
and
when
he
came
to
samaria
he
slew
all
that
remained
unto
ahab
in
samaria
till
he
had
destroyed
him
according
to
the
saying
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
to
elijah
and
jehu
gathered
all
the
people
together
and
said
unto
them
ahab
served
baal
a
little
but
jehu
shall
serve
him
much
now
therefore
call
unto
me
all
the
prophets
of
baal
all
his
servants
and
all
his
priests
let
none
be
wanting
for
i
have
a
great
sacrifice
to
do
to
baal
whosoever
shall
be
wanting
he
shall
not
live
but
jehu
did
it
in
subtilty
to
the
intent
that
he
might
destroy
the
worshippers
of
baal
and
jehu
said
proclaim
a
solemn
assembly
for
baal
and
they
proclaimed
it
and
jehu
sent
through
all
israel
and
all
the
worshippers
of
baal
came
so
that
there
was
not
a
man
left
that
came
not
and
they
came
into
the
house
of
baal
and
the
house
of
baal
was
full
from
one
end
to
another
and
he
said
unto
him
that
was
over
the
vestry
bring
forth
vestments
for
all
the
worshippers
of
baal
and
he
brought
them
forth
vestments
and
jehu
went
and
jehonadab
the
son
of
rechab
into
the
house
of
baal
and
said
unto
the
worshippers
of
baal
search
and
look
that
there
be
here
with
you
none
of
the
servants
of
the
lord
but
the
worshippers
of
baal
only
and
when
they
went
in
to
offer
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
jehu
appointed
fourscore
men
without
and
said
if
any
of
the
men
whom
i
have
brought
into
your
hands
escape
he
that
letteth
him
go
his
life
shall
be
for
the
life
of
him
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
he
had
made
an
end
of
offering
the
burnt
offering
that
jehu
said
to
the
guard
and
to
the
captains
go
in
and
slay
them
let
none
come
forth
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
the
guard
and
the
captains
cast
them
out
and
went
to
the
city
of
the
house
of
baal
and
they
brought
forth
the
images
out
of
the
house
of
baal
and
burned
them
and
they
brake
down
the
image
of
baal
and
brake
down
the
house
of
baal
and
made
it
a
draught
house
unto
this
day
thus
jehu
destroyed
baal
out
of
israel
howbeit
from
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
jehu
departed
not
from
after
them
to
wit
the
golden
calves
that
were
in
bethel
and
that
were
in
dan
and
the
lord
said
unto
jehu
because
thou
hast
done
well
in
executing
that
which
is
right
in
mine
eyes
and
hast
done
unto
the
house
of
ahab
according
to
all
that
was
in
mine
heart
thy
children
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
sit
on
the
throne
of
israel
but
jehu
took
no
heed
to
walk
in
the
law
of
the
lord
god
of
israel
with
all
his
heart
for
he
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
made
israel
to
sin
in
those
days
the
lord
began
to
cut
israel
short
and
hazael
smote
them
in
all
the
coasts
of
israel
from
jordan
eastward
all
the
land
of
gilead
the
gadites
and
the
reubenites
and
the
manassites
from
aroer
which
is
by
the
river
arnon
even
gilead
and
bashan
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
jehu
and
all
that
he
did
and
all
his
might
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
jehu
slept
with
his
fathers
and
they
buried
him
in
samaria
and
jehoahaz
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
the
time
that
jehu
reigned
over
israel
in
samaria
was
twenty
and
eight
years
and
when
athaliah
the
mother
of
ahaziah
saw
that
her
son
was
dead
she
arose
and
destroyed
all
the
seed
royal
but
jehosheba
the
daughter
of
king
joram
sister
of
ahaziah
took
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
and
stole
him
from
among
the
king's
sons
which
were
slain
and
they
hid
him
even
him
and
his
nurse
in
the
bedchamber
from
athaliah
so
that
he
was
not
slain
and
he
was
with
her
hid
in
the
house
of
the
lord
six
years
and
athaliah
did
reign
over
the
land
and
the
seventh
year
jehoiada
sent
and
fetched
the
rulers
over
hundreds
with
the
captains
and
the
guard
and
brought
them
to
him
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
made
a
covenant
with
them
and
took
an
oath
of
them
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
shewed
them
the
king's
son
and
he
commanded
them
saying
this
is
the
thing
that
ye
shall
do
a
third
part
of
you
that
enter
in
on
the
sabbath
shall
even
be
keepers
of
the
watch
of
the
king's
house
and
a
third
part
shall
be
at
the
gate
of
sur
and
a
third
part
at
the
gate
behind
the
guard
so
shall
ye
keep
the
watch
of
the
house
that
it
be
not
broken
down
and
two
parts
of
all
you
that
go
forth
on
the
sabbath
even
they
shall
keep
the
watch
of
the
house
of
the
lord
about
the
king
and
ye
shall
compass
the
king
round
about
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
he
that
cometh
within
the
ranges
let
him
be
slain
and
be
ye
with
the
king
as
he
goeth
out
and
as
he
cometh
in
and
the
captains
over
the
hundreds
did
according
to
all
things
that
jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
and
they
took
every
man
his
men
that
were
to
come
in
on
the
sabbath
with
them
that
should
go
out
on
the
sabbath
and
came
to
jehoiada
the
priest
and
to
the
captains
over
hundreds
did
the
priest
give
king
david's
spears
and
shields
that
were
in
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
the
guard
stood
every
man
with
his
weapons
in
his
hand
round
about
the
king
from
the
right
corner
of
the
temple
to
the
left
corner
of
the
temple
along
by
the
altar
and
the
temple
and
he
brought
forth
the
king's
son
and
put
the
crown
upon
him
and
gave
him
the
testimony
and
they
made
him
king
and
anointed
him
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
said
god
save
the
king
and
when
athaliah
heard
the
noise
of
the
guard
and
of
the
people
she
came
to
the
people
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
when
she
looked
behold
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar
as
the
manner
was
and
the
princes
and
the
trumpeters
by
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
blew
with
trumpets
and
athaliah
rent
her
clothes
and
cried
treason
treason
but
jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
captains
of
the
hundreds
the
officers
of
the
host
and
said
unto
them
have
her
forth
without
the
ranges
and
him
that
followeth
her
kill
with
the
sword
for
the
priest
had
said
let
her
not
be
slain
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
laid
hands
on
her
and
she
went
by
the
way
by
the
which
the
horses
came
into
the
king's
house
and
there
was
she
slain
and
jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
the
lord
and
the
king
and
the
people
that
they
should
be
the
lord's
people
between
the
king
also
and
the
people
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
went
into
the
house
of
baal
and
brake
it
down
his
altars
and
his
images
brake
they
in
pieces
thoroughly
and
slew
mattan
the
priest
of
baal
before
the
altars
and
the
priest
appointed
officers
over
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
took
the
rulers
over
hundreds
and
the
captains
and
the
guard
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
they
brought
down
the
king
from
the
house
of
the
lord
and
came
by
the
way
of
the
gate
of
the
guard
to
the
king's
house
and
he
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
kings
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
in
quiet
and
they
slew
athaliah
with
the
sword
beside
the
king's
house
seven
years
old
was
jehoash
when
he
began
to
reign
in
the
seventh
year
of
jehu
jehoash
began
to
reign
and
forty
years
reigned
he
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
zibiah
of
beersheba
and
jehoash
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
his
days
wherein
jehoiada
the
priest
instructed
him
but
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
the
people
still
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places
and
jehoash
said
to
the
priests
all
the
money
of
the
dedicated
things
that
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
even
the
money
of
every
one
that
passeth
the
account
the
money
that
every
man
is
set
at
and
all
the
money
that
cometh
into
any
man's
heart
to
bring
into
the
house
of
the
lord
let
the
priests
take
it
to
them
every
man
of
his
acquaintance
and
let
them
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
wheresoever
any
breach
shall
be
found
but
it
was
so
that
in
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
king
jehoash
the
priests
had
not
repaired
the
breaches
of
the
house
then
king
jehoash
called
for
jehoiada
the
priest
and
the
other
priests
and
said
unto
them
why
repair
ye
not
the
breaches
of
the
house
now
therefore
receive
no
more
money
of
your
acquaintance
but
deliver
it
for
the
breaches
of
the
house
and
the
priests
consented
to
receive
no
more
money
of
the
people
neither
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
but
jehoiada
the
priest
took
a
chest
and
bored
a
hole
in
the
lid
of
it
and
set
it
beside
the
altar
on
the
right
side
as
one
cometh
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
priests
that
kept
the
door
put
therein
all
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
it
was
so
when
they
saw
that
there
was
much
money
in
the
chest
that
the
king's
scribe
and
the
high
priest
came
up
and
they
put
up
in
bags
and
told
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
gave
the
money
being
told
into
the
hands
of
them
that
did
the
work
that
had
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
they
laid
it
out
to
the
carpenters
and
builders
that
wrought
upon
the
house
of
the
lord
and
to
masons
and
hewers
of
stone
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewed
stone
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
for
all
that
was
laid
out
for
the
house
to
repair
it
howbeit
there
were
not
made
for
the
house
of
the
lord
bowls
of
silver
snuffers
basons
trumpets
any
vessels
of
gold
or
vessels
of
silver
of
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
but
they
gave
that
to
the
workmen
and
repaired
therewith
the
house
of
the
lord
moreover
they
reckoned
not
with
the
men
into
whose
hand
they
delivered
the
money
to
be
bestowed
on
workmen
for
they
dealt
faithfully
the
trespass
money
and
sin
money
was
not
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
it
was
the
priests
then
hazael
king
of
syria
went
up
and
fought
against
gath
and
took
it
and
hazael
set
his
face
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
jehoash
king
of
judah
took
all
the
hallowed
things
that
jehoshaphat
and
jehoram
and
ahaziah
his
fathers
kings
of
judah
had
dedicated
and
his
own
hallowed
things
and
all
the
gold
that
was
found
in
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
king's
house
and
sent
it
to
hazael
king
of
syria
and
he
went
away
from
jerusalem
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
joash
and
all
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
his
servants
arose
and
made
a
conspiracy
and
slew
joash
in
the
house
of
millo
which
goeth
down
to
silla
for
jozachar
the
son
of
shimeath
and
jehozabad
the
son
of
shomer
his
servants
smote
him
and
he
died
and
they
buried
him
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
amaziah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
three
and
twentieth
year
of
joash
the
son
of
ahaziah
king
of
judah
jehoahaz
the
son
of
jehu
began
to
reign
over
israel
in
samaria
and
reigned
seventeen
years
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
followed
the
sins
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
which
made
israel
to
sin
he
departed
not
therefrom
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
hazael
king
of
syria
and
into
the
hand
of
benhadad
the
son
of
hazael
all
their
days
and
jehoahaz
besought
the
lord
and
the
lord
hearkened
unto
him
for
he
saw
the
oppression
of
israel
because
the
king
of
syria
oppressed
them
and
the
lord
gave
israel
a
saviour
so
that
they
went
out
from
under
the
hand
of
the
syrians
and
the
children
of
israel
dwelt
in
their
tents
as
beforetime
nevertheless
they
departed
not
from
the
sins
of
the
house
of
jeroboam
who
made
israel
sin
but
walked
therein
and
there
remained
the
grove
also
in
samaria

now
elisha
was
fallen
sick
of
his
sickness
whereof
he
died
and
joash
the
king
of
israel
came
down
unto
him
and
wept
over
his
face
and
said
o
my
father
my
father
the
chariot
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
and
elisha
said
unto
him
take
bow
and
arrows
and
he
took
unto
him
bow
and
arrows
and
he
said
to
the
king
of

put
thine
hand
upon

bow
and
he
put

upon

and
elisha
put

hands
and
he
said
open

window
eastward
and
he
opened

then

said
shoot
and
he
shot
and
he
said
the
arrow
of
the
lord's
deliverance
and
the
arrow
of
deliverance
from
syria
for
thou
shalt
smite
the
syrians
in
aphek
till
thou
have
consumed
them
and
he
said
take
the
arrows
and
he
took
them
and
he
said
unto
the
king
of
israel
smite
upon
the
ground
and
he
smote
thrice
and
stayed
and
the
man
of
god
was
wroth
with
him
and
said
thou
shouldest
have
smitten
five
or
six
times
then
hadst
thou
smitten
syria
till
thou
hadst
consumed
it
whereas
now
thou
shalt
smite
syria
but
thrice
and
elisha
died
and
they
buried
him
and
the
bands
of
the
moabites
invaded
the
land
at
the
coming
in
of
the
year
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
were
burying
a
man
that
behold
they
spied
a
band
of
men
and
they
cast
the
man
into
the
sepulchre
of
elisha
and
when
the
man
was
let
down
and
touched
the
bones
of
elisha
he
revived
and
stood
up
on
his
feet
but
hazael
king
of
syria
oppressed
israel
all
the
days
of
jehoahaz
and
the
lord
was
gracious
unto
them
and
had
compassion
on
them
and
had
respect
unto
them
because
of
his
covenant
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
would
not
destroy
them
neither
cast
he
them
from
his
presence
as
yet
so
hazael
king
of
syria
died
and
benhadad
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
and
jehoash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
took
again
out
of
the
hand
of
benhadad
the
son
of
hazael
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
out
of
the
hand
of
jehoahaz
his
father
by
war
three
times
did
joash
beat
him
and
recovered
the
cities
of
israel
in
the
second
year
of
joash
son
of
jehoahaz
king
of
israel
reigned
amaziah
the
son
of
joash
king
of

he
was
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
jehoaddan
of
jerusalem
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yet
not
like
david
his
father
he
did
according
to
all
things
as
joash
his
father
did
howbeit
the
high
places
were
not
taken
away
as
yet
the
people
did
sacrifice
and
burnt
incense
on
the
high
places
and
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
the
kingdom
was
confirmed
in
his
hand
that
he
slew
his
servants
which
had
slain
the
king
his
father
but
the
children
of
the
murderers
he
slew
not
according
unto
that
which
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
wherein
the
lord
commanded
saying
the
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children
nor
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers
but
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin
he
slew
of
edom
in
the
valley
of
salt
ten
thousand
and
took
selah
by
war
and
called
the
name
of
it
joktheel
unto
this
day
then
amaziah
sent
messengers
to
jehoash
the
son
of
jehoahaz
son
of
jehu
king
of
israel
saying
come
let
us
look
one
another
in
the
face
and
jehoash
the
king
of
israel
sent
to
amaziah
king
of
judah
saying
the
thistle
that
was
in
lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
lebanon
saying
give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife
and
there
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
lebanon
and
trode
down
the
thistle
thou
hast
indeed
smitten
edom
and
thine
heart
hath
lifted
thee
up
glory
of
this
and
tarry
at
home
for
why
shouldest
thou
meddle
to
thy
hurt
that
thou
shouldest
fall
even
thou
and
judah
with
thee
but
amaziah
would
not
hear
therefore
jehoash
king
of
israel
went
up
and
he
and
amaziah
king
of
judah
looked
one
another
in
the
face
at
bethshemesh
which
belongeth
to
judah
and
judah
was
put
to
the
worse
before
israel
and
they
fled
every
man
to
their
tents

jehoash
king
of
israel
took
amaziah

did
not
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
his
god
like
david
his
father
but
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
israel
yea
and
made
his
son
to
pass
through
the
fire
according
to
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
cast
out
from
before
the
children
of
israel
and
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
in
the
high
places
and
on
the
hills
and
under
every
green
tree
then
rezin
king
of
syria
and
pekah
son
of
remaliah
king
of
israel
came
up
to
jerusalem
to
war
and
they
besieged
ahaz
but
could
not
overcome
him
at
that
time
rezin
king
of
syria
recovered
elath
to
syria
and
drave
the
jews
from
elath
and
the
syrians
came
to
elath
and
dwelt
there
unto
this
day
so
ahaz
sent
messengers
to
tiglathpileser
king
of
assyria
saying
i
am
thy
servant
and
thy
son
come
up
and
save
me
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
syria
and
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
israel
which
rise
up
against
me
and
ahaz
took
the
silver
and
gold
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
and
sent
it
for
a
present
to
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
king
of
assyria
hearkened
unto
him
for
the
king
of
assyria
went
up
against
damascus
and
took
it
and
carried
the
people
of
it
captive
to
kir
and
slew
rezin
and
king
ahaz
went
to
damascus
to
meet
tiglathpileser
king
of
assyria
and
saw
an
altar
that
was
at
damascus
and
king
ahaz
sent
to
urijah
the
priest
the
fashion
of
the
altar
and
the
pattern
of
it
according
to
all
the
workmanship
thereof
and
urijah
the
priest
built
an
altar
according
to
all
that
king
ahaz
had
sent
from
damascus
so
urijah
the
priest
made
it
against
king
ahaz
came
from
damascus
and
when
the
king
was
come
from
damascus
the
king
saw
the
altar
and
the
king
approached
to
the
altar
and
offered
thereon
and
he
burnt
his
burnt
offering
and
his
meat
offering
and
poured
his
drink
offering
and
sprinkled
the
blood
of
his
peace
offerings
upon
the
altar
and
he
brought
also
the
brasen
altar
which
was
before
the
lord
from
the
forefront
of
the
house
from
between
the
altar
and
the
house
of
the
lord
and
put
it
on
the
north
side
of
the
altar
and
king
ahaz
commanded
urijah
the
priest
saying
upon
the
great
altar
burn
the
morning
burnt
offering
and
the
evening
meat
offering
and
the
king's
burnt
sacrifice
and
his
meat
offering
with
the
burnt
offering
of
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
their
meat
offering
and
their
drink
offerings
and
sprinkle
upon
it
all
the
blood
of
the
burnt
offering
and
all
the
blood
of
the
sacrifice
and
the
brasen
altar
shall
be
for
me
to
enquire
by
thus
did
urijah
the
priest
according
to
all
that
king
ahaz
commanded
and
king
ahaz
cut
off
the
borders
of
the
bases
and
removed
the
laver
from
off
them
and
took
down
the
sea
from
off
the
brasen
oxen
that
were
under
it
and
put
it
upon
the
pavement
of
stones
and
the
covert
for
the
sabbath
that
they
had
built
in
the
house
and
the
king's
entry
without
turned
he
from
the
house
of
the
lord
for
the
king
of
assyria
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
ahaz
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
ahaz
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
with
his
fathers
in
the
city
of
david
and
hezekiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
the
twelfth
year
of
ahaz
king
of
judah
began
hoshea
the
son
of
elah
to
reign
in
samaria
over
israel
nine
years
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
but
not
as
the
kings
of
israel
that
were
before
him
against
him
came
up
shalmaneser
king
of
assyria
and
hoshea
became
his
servant
and
gave
him
presents
and
the
king
of
assyria
found
conspiracy
in
hoshea
for
he
had
sent
messengers
to
so
king
of
egypt
and
brought
no
present
to
the
king
of
assyria
as
he
had
done
year
by
year
therefore
the
king
of
assyria
shut
him
up
and
bound
him
in
prison
then
the
king
of
assyria
came
up
throughout
all
the
land
and
went
up
to
samaria
and
besieged
it
three
years
in
the
ninth
year
of
hoshea
the
king
of
assyria
took
samaria
and
carried
israel
away
into
assyria
and
placed
them
in
halah
and
in
habor
by
the
river
of
gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
medes
for
so
it
was
that
the
children
of
israel
had
sinned
against
the
lord
their
god
which
had
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
under
the
hand
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
had
feared
other
gods
and
walked
in
the
statutes
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
cast
out
from
before
the
children
of
israel
and
of
the
kings
of
israel
which
they
had
made
and
the
children
of
israel
did
secretly
those
things
that
were
not
right
against
the
lord
their
god
and
they
built
them
high
places
in
all
their
cities
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city
and
they
set
them
up
images
and
groves
in
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
they
burnt
incense
in
all
the
high
places
as
did
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
carried
away
before
them
and
wrought
wicked
things
to
provoke
the
lord
to
anger
for
they
served
idols
whereof
the
lord
had
said
unto
them
ye
shall
not
do
this
thing
yet
the
lord
testified
against
israel
and
against
judah
by
all
the
prophets
and
by
all
the
seers
saying
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways
and
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
according
to
all
the
law
which
i
commanded
your
fathers
and
which
i
sent
to
you
by
my
servants
the
prophets
notwithstanding
they
would
not
hear
but
hardened
their
necks
like
to
the
neck
of
their
fathers
that
did
not
believe
in
the
lord
their
god
and
they
rejected
his
statutes
and
his
covenant
that
he
made
with
their
fathers
and
his
testimonies
which
he
testified
against
them
and
they
followed
vanity
and
became
vain
and
went
after
the
heathen
that
were
round
about
them
concerning
whom
the
lord
had
charged
them
that
they
should
not
do
like
them
and
they
left
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
their
god
and
made
them
molten
images
even
two
calves
and
made
a
grove
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
baal
and
they
caused
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
and
used
divination
and
enchantments
and
sold
themselves
to
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
therefore
the
lord
was
very
angry
with
israel
and
removed
them
out
of
his
sight
there
was
none
left
but
the
tribe
of
judah
only
also
judah
kept
not
the
commandments
of
the
lord
their
god
but
walked
in
the
statutes
of
israel
which
they
made
and
the
lord
rejected
all
the
seed
of
israel
and
afflicted
them
and
delivered
them
into
the
hand
of
spoilers
until
he
had
cast
them
out
of
his
sight
for
he
rent
israel
from
the
house
of
david
and
they
made
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
king
and
jeroboam
drave
israel
from
following
the
lord
and
made
them
sin
a
great
sin
for
the
children
of
israel
walked
in
all
the
sins
of
jeroboam
which
he
did
they
departed
not
from
them
until
the
lord
removed
israel
out
of
his
sight
as
he
had
said
by
all
his
servants
the
prophets
so
was
israel
carried
away
out
of
their
own
land
to
assyria
unto
this
day
and
the
king
of
assyria
brought
men
from
babylon
and
from
cuthah
and
from
ava
and
from
hamath
and
from
sepharvaim
and
placed
them
in
the
cities
of
samaria
instead
of
the
children
of
israel
and
they
possessed
samaria
and
dwelt
in
the
cities
thereof
and
so
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
their
dwelling
there
that
they
feared
not
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
sent
lions
among
them
which
slew
some
of
them
wherefore
they
spake
to
the
king
of
assyria
saying
the
nations
which
thou
hast
removed
and
placed
in
the
cities
of
samaria
know
not
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
therefore
he
hath
sent
lions
among
them
and
behold
they
slay
them
because
they
know
not
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
then
the
king
of
assyria
commanded
saying
carry
thither
one
of
the
priests
whom
ye
brought
from
thence
and
let
them
go
and
dwell
there
and
let
him
teach
them
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
then
one
of
the
priests
whom
they
had
carried
away
from
samaria
came
and
dwelt
in
bethel
and
taught
them
how
they
should
fear
the
lord
howbeit
every
nation
made
gods
of
their
own
and
put
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places
which
the
samaritans
had
made
every
nation
in
their
cities
wherein
they
dwelt
and
the
men
of
babylon
made
succothbenoth
and
the
men
of
cuth
made
nergal
and
the
men
of
hamath
made
ashima
and
the
avites
made
nibhaz
and
tartak
and
the
sepharvites
burnt
their
children
in
fire
to
adrammelech
and
anammelech
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
so
they
feared
the
lord
and
made
unto
themselves
of
the
lowest
of
them
priests
of
the
high
places
which
sacrificed
for
them
in
the
houses
of
the
high
places
they
feared
the
lord
and
served
their
own
gods
after
the
manner
of
the
nations
whom
they
carried
away
from
thence
unto
this
day
they
do
after
the
former
manners
they
fear
not
the
lord
neither
do
they
after
their
statutes
or
after
their
ordinances
or
after
the
law
and
commandment
which
the
lord
commanded
the
children
of
jacob
whom
he
named
israel
with
whom
the
lord
had
made
a
covenant
and
charged
them
saying
ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods
nor
bow
yourselves
to
them
nor
serve
them
nor
sacrifice
to
them
but
the
lord
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
with
great
power
and
a
stretched
out
arm
him
shall
ye
fear
and
him
shall
ye
worship
and
to
him
shall
ye
do
sacrifice
and
the
statutes
and
the
ordinances
and
the
law
and
the
commandment
which
he
wrote
for
you
ye
shall
observe
to
do
for
evermore
and
ye
shall
not
fear
other
gods
and
the
covenant
that
i
have
made
with
you
ye
shall
not
forget
neither
shall
ye
fear
other
gods
but
the
lord
your
god
ye
shall
fear
and
he
shall
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
all
your
enemies
howbeit
they
did
not
hearken
but
they
did
after
their
former
manner
so
these
nations
feared
the
lord
and
served
their
graven
images
both
their
children
and
their
children's
children
as
did
their
fathers
so
do
they
unto
this
day
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
third
year
of
hoshea
son
of
elah
king
of
israel
that
hezekiah
the
son
of
ahaz
king
of
judah
began
to
reign
twenty
and
five
years
old
was
he
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
twenty
and
nine
years
in
jerusalem
his
mother's
name
also
was
abi
the
daughter
of
zachariah
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
according
to
all
that
david
his
father
did
he
removed
the
high
places
and
brake
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
brake
in
pieces
the
brasen
serpent
that
moses
had
made
for
unto
those
days
the
children
of
israel
did
burn
incense
to
it
and
he
called
it
nehushtan
he
trusted
in
the
lord
god
of
israel
so
that
after
him
was
none
like
him
among
all
the
kings
of
judah
nor
any
that
were
before
him
for
he
clave
to
the
lord
and
departed
not
from
following
him
but
kept
his
commandments
which
the
lord
commanded
moses
and
the
lord
was
with
him
and
he
prospered
whithersoever
he
went
forth
and
he
rebelled
against
the
king
of
assyria
and
served
him
not
he
smote
the
philistines
even
unto
gaza
and
the
borders
thereof
from
the
tower
of
the
watchmen
to
the
fenced
city
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fourth
year
of
king
hezekiah
which
was
the
seventh
year
of
hoshea
son
of
elah
king
of
israel
that
shalmaneser
king
of
assyria
came
up
against
samaria
and
besieged
it
and
at
the
end
of
three
years
they
took
it
even
in
the
sixth
year
of
hezekiah
that
is
in
the
ninth
year
of
hoshea
king
of
israel
samaria
was
taken
and
the
king
of
assyria
did
carry
away
israel
unto
assyria
and
put
them
in
halah
and
in
habor
by
the
river
of
gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
medes
because
they
obeyed
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
but
transgressed
his
covenant
and
all
that
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
commanded
and
would
not
hear
them
nor
do
them
now
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
king
hezekiah
did
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
come
up
against
all
the
fenced
cities
of
judah
and
took
them
and
hezekiah
king
of
judah
sent
to
the
king
of
assyria
to
lachish
saying
i
have
offended
return
from
me
that
which
thou
puttest
on
me
will
i
bear
and
the
king
of
assyria
appointed
unto
hezekiah
king
of
judah
three
hundred
talents
of
silver
and
thirty
talents
of
gold
and
hezekiah
gave
him
all
the
silver
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
in
the
treasures
of
the
king's
house
at
that
time
did
hezekiah
cut
off
the
gold
from
the
doors
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
from
the
pillars
which
hezekiah
king
of
judah
had
overlaid
and
gave
it
to
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
king
of
assyria
sent
tartan
and
rabsaris
and
rabshakeh
from
lachish
to
king
hezekiah
with
a
great
host
against
jerusalem
and
they
went
up
and
came
to
jerusalem
and
when
they
were
come
up
they
came
and
stood
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
which
is
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field
and
when
they
had
called
to
the
king
there
came
out
to
them
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
and
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
speak
ye
now
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
what
confidence
is
this
wherein
thou
trustest
thou
sayest
but
they
are
but
vain
words
i
have
counsel
and
strength
for
the
war
now
on
whom
dost
thou
trust
that
thou
rebellest
against
me
now
behold
thou
trustest
upon
the
staff
of
this
bruised
reed
even
upon
egypt
on
which
if
a
man
lean
it
will
go
into
his
hand
and
pierce
it
so
is
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
unto
all
that
trust
on
him
but
if
ye
say
unto
me
we
trust
in
the
lord
our
god
is
not
that
he
whose
high
places
and
whose
altars
hezekiah
hath
taken
away
and
hath
said
to
judah
and
jerusalem
ye
shall
worship
before
this
altar
in
jerusalem
now
therefore
i
pray
thee
give
pledges
to
my
lord
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
deliver
thee
two
thousand
horses
if
thou
be
able
on
thy
part
to
set
riders
upon
them
how
then
wilt
thou
turn
away
the
face
of
one
captain
of
the
least
of
my
master's
servants
and
put
thy
trust
on
egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
am
i
now
come
up
without
the
lord
against
this
place
to
destroy
it
the
lord
said
to
me
go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
then
said
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
and
shebna
and
joah
unto
rabshakeh
speak
i
pray
thee
to
thy
servants
in
the
syrian
language
for
we
understand
it
and
talk
not
with
us
in
the
jews
language
in
the
ears
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
wall
but
rabshakeh
said
unto
them
hath
my
master
sent
me
to
thy
master
and
to
thee
to
speak
these
words
hath
he
not
sent
me
to
the
men
which
sit
on
the
wall
that
they
may
eat
their
own
dung
and
drink
their
own
piss
with
you
then
rabshakeh
stood
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
in
the
jews
language
and
spake
saying
hear
the
word
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
assyria
thus
saith
the
king
let
not
hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
shall
not
be
able
to
deliver
you
out
of
his
hand
neither
let
hezekiah
make
you
trust
in
the
lord
saying
the
lord
will
surely
deliver
us
and
this
city
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
hearken
not
to
hezekiah
for
thus
saith
the
king
of
assyria
make
an
agreement
with
me
by
a
present
and
come
out
to
me
and
then
eat
ye
every
man
of
his
own
vine
and
every
one
of
his
fig
tree
and
drink
ye
every
one
the
waters
of
his
cistern
until
i
come
and
take
you
away
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
a
land
of
oil
olive
and
of
honey
that
ye
may
live
and
not
die
and
hearken
not
unto
hezekiah
when
he
persuadeth
you
saying
the
lord
will
deliver
us
hath
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
at
all
his
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
where
are
the
gods
of
hamath
and
of
arpad
where
are
the
gods
of
sepharvaim
hena
and
ivah
have
they
delivered
samaria
out
of
mine
hand
who
are
they
among
all
the
gods
of
the
countries
that
have
delivered
their
country
out
of
mine
hand
that
the
lord
should
deliver
jerusalem
out
of
mine
hand
but
the
people
held
their
peace
and
answered
him
not
a
word
for
the
king's
commandment
was
saying
answer
him
not
then
came
eliakim
the
son
of
hilkiah
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
joah
the
son
of
asaph
the
recorder
to
hezekiah
with
their
clothes
rent
and
told
him
the
words
of
rabshakeh
and
it
came
to
pass
when
king
hezekiah
heard
it
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
sent
eliakim
which
was
over
the
household
and
shebna
the
scribe
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
to
isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
amoz
and
they
said
unto
him
thus
saith
hezekiah
this
day
is
a
day
of
trouble
and
of
rebuke
and
blasphemy
for
the
children
are
come
to
the
birth
and
there
is
not
strength
to
bring
forth
it
may
be
the
lord
thy
god
will
hear
all
the
words
of
rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
assyria
his
master
hath
sent
to
reproach
the
living
god
and
will
reprove
the
words
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
heard
wherefore
lift
up
thy
prayer
for
the
remnant
that
are
left
so
the
servants
of
king
hezekiah
came
to
isaiah
and
isaiah
said
unto
them
thus
shall
ye
say
to
your
master
thus
saith
the
lord
be
not
afraid
of
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
with
which
the
servants
of
the
king
of
assyria
have
blasphemed
me
behold
i
will
send
a
blast
upon
him
and
he
shall
hear
a
rumour
and
shall
return
to
his
own
land
and
i
will
cause
him
to
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
so
rabshakeh
returned
and
found
the
king
of
assyria
warring
against
libnah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
was
departed
from
lachish
and
when
he
heard
say
of
tirhakah
king
of
ethiopia
behold
he
is
come
out
to
fight
against
thee
he
sent
messengers
again
unto
hezekiah
saying
thus
shall
ye
speak
to
hezekiah
king
of
judah
saying
let
not
thy
god
in
whom
thou
trustest
deceive
thee
saying
jerusalem
shall
not
be
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
behold
thou
hast
heard
what
the
kings
of
assyria
have
done
to
all
lands
by
destroying
them
utterly
and
shalt
thou
be
delivered
have
the
gods
of
the
nations
delivered
them
which
my
fathers
have
destroyed
as
gozan
and
haran
and
rezeph
and
the
children
of
eden
which
were
in
thelasar
where
is
the
king
of
hamath
and
the
king
of
arpad
and
the
king
of
the
city
of
sepharvaim
of
hena
and
ivah
and
hezekiah
received
the
letter
of
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
it
and
hezekiah
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
spread
it
before
the
lord
and
hezekiah
prayed
before
the
lord
and
said
o
lord
god
of
israel
which
dwellest
between
the
cherubims
thou
art
the
god
even
thou
alone
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
thou
hast
made
heaven
and
earth
lord
bow
down
thine
ear
and
hear
open
lord
thine
eyes
and
see
and
hear
the
words
of
sennacherib
which
hath
sent
him
to
reproach
the
living
god
of
a
truth
lord
the
kings
of
assyria
have
destroyed
the
nations
and
their
lands
and
have
cast
their
gods
into
the
fire
for
they
were
no
gods
but
the
work
of
men's
hands
wood
and
stone
therefore
they
have
destroyed
them
now
therefore
o
lord
our
god
i
beseech
thee
save
thou
us
out
of
his
hand
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
thou
art
the
lord
god
even
thou
only
then
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
sent
to
hezekiah
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
that
which
thou
hast
prayed
to
me
against
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
i
have
heard
this
is
the
word
that
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
him
the
virgin
the
daughter
of
zion
hath
despised
thee
and
laughed
thee
to
scorn
the
daughter
of
jerusalem
hath
shaken
her
head
at
thee
whom
hast
thou
reproached
and
blasphemed
and
against
whom
hast
thou
exalted
thy
voice
and
lifted
up
thine
eyes
on
high
even
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
by
thy
messengers
thou
hast
reproached
the
lord
and
hast
said
with
the
multitude
of
my
chariots
i
am
come
up
to
the
height
of
the
mountains
to
the
sides
of
lebanon
and
will
cut
down
the
tall
cedar
trees
thereof
and
the
choice
fir
trees
thereof
and
i
will
enter
into
the
lodgings
of
his
borders
and
into
the
forest
of
his
carmel
i
have
digged
and
drunk
strange
waters
and
with
the
sole
of
my
feet
have
i
dried
up
all
the
rivers
of
besieged
places
hast
thou
not
heard
long
ago
how
i
have
done
it
and
of
ancient
times
that
i
have
formed
it
now
have
i
brought
it
to
pass
that
thou
shouldest
be
to
lay
waste
fenced
cities
into
ruinous
heaps
therefore
their
inhabitants
were
of
small
power
they
were
dismayed
and
confounded
they
were
as
the
grass
of
the
field
and
as
the
green
herb
as
the
grass
on
the
house
tops
and
as
corn
blasted
before
it
be
grown
up
but
i
know
thy
abode
and
thy
going
out
and
thy
coming
in
and
thy
rage
against
me
because
thy
rage
against
me
and
thy
tumult
is
come
up
into
mine
ears
therefore
i
will
put
my
hook
in
thy
nose
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
thee
ye
shall
eat
this
year
such
things
as
grow
of
themselves
and
in
the
second
year
that
which
springeth
of
the
same
and
in
the
third
year
sow
ye
and
reap
and
plant
vineyards
and
eat
the
fruits
thereof
and
the
remnant
that
is
escaped
of
the
house
of
judah
shall
yet
again
take
root
downward
and
bear
fruit
upward
for
out
of
jerusalem
shall
go
forth
a
remnant
and
they
that
escape
out
of
mount
zion
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
do
this
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
king
of
assyria
he
shall
not
come
into
this
city
nor
shoot
an
arrow
there
nor
come
before
it
with
shield
nor
cast
a
bank
against
it
by
the
way
that
he
came
by
the
same
shall
he
return
and
shall
not
come
into
this
city
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
defend
this
city
to
save
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david's
sake
and
it
came
to
pass
that
night
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
went
out
and
smote
in
the
camp
of
the
assyrians
an
hundred
fourscore
and
five
thousand
and
when
they
arose
early
in
the
morning
behold
they
were
all
dead
corpses
so
sennacherib
king
of
assyria
departed
and
went
and
returned
and
dwelt
at
nineveh
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
worshipping
in
the
house
of
nisroch
his
god
that
adrammelech
and
sharezer
his
sons
smote
him
with
the
sword
and
they
escaped
into
the
land
of
armenia
and
esarhaddon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
in
those
days
was
hezekiah
sick
unto
death
and
the
prophet
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
came
to
him
and
said
unto
him
thus
saith
the
lord
set
thine
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
live
then
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
remember
now
how
i
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight
and
hezekiah
wept
sore
and
it
came
to
pass
afore
isaiah
was
gone
out
into
the
middle
court
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
him
saying
turn
again
and
tell
hezekiah
the
captain
of
my
people
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
heal
thee
on
the
third
day
thou
shalt
go
up
unto
the
house
of
the
lord
and
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
i
will
defend
this
city
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david's
sake
and
isaiah
said
take
a
lump
of
figs
and
they
took
and
laid
it
on
the
boil
and
he
recovered
and
hezekiah
said
unto
isaiah
what
shall
be
the
sign
that
the
lord
will
heal
me
and
that
i
shall
go
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
the
third
day
and
isaiah
said
this
sign
shalt
thou
have
of
the
lord
that
the
lord
will
do
the
thing
that
he
hath
spoken
shall
the
shadow
go
forward
ten
degrees
or
go
back
ten
degrees
and
hezekiah
answered
it
is
a
light
thing
for
the
shadow
to
go
down
ten
degrees
nay
but
let
the
shadow
return
backward
ten
degrees
and
isaiah
the
prophet
cried
unto
the
lord
and
he
brought
the
shadow
ten
degrees
backward
by
which
it
had
gone
down
in
the
dial
of
ahaz
at
that
time
berodachbaladan
the
son
of
baladan
king
of
babylon
sent
letters
and
a
present
unto
hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
hezekiah
had
been
sick
and
hezekiah
hearkened
unto
them
and
shewed
them
all
the
house
of
his
precious
things
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
spices
and
the
precious
ointment
and
all
the
house
of
his
armour
and
all
that
was
found
in
his
treasures
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
nor
in
all
his
dominion
that
hezekiah
shewed
them
not
then
came
isaiah
the
prophet
unto
king
hezekiah
and
said
unto
him
what
said
these
men
and
from
whence
came
they
unto
thee
and
hezekiah
said
they
are
come
from
a
far
country
even
from
babylon
and
he
said
what
have
they
seen
in
thine
house
and
hezekiah
answered
all
the
things
that
are
in
mine
house
have
they
seen
there
is
nothing
among
my
treasures
that
i
have
not
shewed
them
and
isaiah
said
unto
hezekiah
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
behold
the
days
come
that
all
that
is
in
thine
house
and
that
which
thy
fathers
have
laid
up
in
store
unto
this
day
shall
be
carried
into
babylon
nothing
shall
be
left
saith
the
lord
and
of
thy
sons
that
shall
issue
from
thee
which
thou
shalt
beget
shall
they
take
away
and
they
shall
be
eunuchs
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
babylon
then
said
hezekiah
unto
isaiah
good
is
the
word
of
the
lord
which
thou
hast
spoken
and
he
said
is
it
not
good
if
peace
and
truth
be
in
my
days
and
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
hezekiah
and
all
his
might
and
how
he
made
a
pool
and
a
conduit
and
brought
water
into
the
city
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
hezekiah
slept
with
his
fathers
and
manasseh
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
manasseh
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
reigned
fifty
and
five
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
hephzibah
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
after
the
abominations
of
the
heathen
whom
the
lord
cast
out
before
the
children
of
israel
for
he
built
up
again
the
high
places
which
hezekiah
his
father
had
destroyed
and
he
reared
up
altars
for
baal
and
made
a
grove
as
did
ahab
king
of
israel
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
them
and
he
built
altars
in
the
house
of
the
lord
of
which
the
lord
said
in
jerusalem
will
i
put
my
name
and
he
built
altars
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
he
made
his
son
pass
through
the
fire
and
observed
times
and
used
enchantments
and
dealt
with
familiar
spirits
and
wizards
he
wrought
much
wickedness
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
to
provoke
him
to
anger
and
he
set
a
graven
image
of
the
grove
that
he
had
made
in
the
house
of
which
the
lord
said
to
david
and
to
solomon
his
son
in
this
house
and
in
jerusalem
which
i
have
chosen
out
of
all
tribes
of
israel
will
i
put
my
name
for
ever
neither
will
i
make
the
feet
of
israel
move
any
more
out
of
the
land
which
i
gave
their
fathers
only
if
they
will
observe
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
them
and
according
to
all
the
law
that
my
servant
moses
commanded
them
but
they
hearkened
not
and
manasseh
seduced
them
to
do
more
evil
than
did
the
nations
whom
the
lord
destroyed
before
the
children
of
israel
and
the
lord
spake
by
his
servants
the
prophets
saying
because
manasseh
king
of
judah
hath
done
these
abominations
and
hath
done
wickedly
above
all
that
the
amorites
did
which
were
before
him
and
hath
made
judah
also
to
sin
with
his
idols
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
behold
i
am
bringing
such
evil
upon
jerusalem
and
judah
that
whosoever
heareth
of
it
both
his
ears
shall
tingle
and
i
will
stretch
over
jerusalem
the
line
of
samaria
and
the
plummet
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
i
will
wipe
jerusalem
as
a
man
wipeth
a
dish
wiping
it
and
turning
it
upside
down
and
i
will
forsake
the
remnant
of
mine
inheritance
and
deliver
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
they
shall
become
a
prey
and
a
spoil
to
all
their
enemies
because
they
have
done
that
which
was
evil
in
my
sight
and
have
provoked
me
to
anger
since
the
day
their
fathers
came
forth
out
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
moreover
manasseh
shed
innocent
blood
very
much
till
he
had
filled
jerusalem
from
one
end
to
another
beside
his
sin
wherewith
he
made
judah
to
sin
in
doing
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
manasseh
and
all
that
he
did
and
his
sin
that
he
sinned
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
manasseh
slept
with
his
fathers
and
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
his
own
house
in
the
garden
of
uzza
and
amon
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
amon
was
twenty
and
two
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
two
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
meshullemeth
the
daughter
of
haruz
of
jotbah
and
he
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
as
his
father
manasseh
did
and
he
walked
in
all
the
way
that
his
father
walked
in
and
served
the
idols
that
his
father
served
and
worshipped
them
and
he
forsook
the
lord
god
of
his
fathers
and
walked
not
in
the
way
of
the
lord
and
the
servants
of
amon
conspired
against
him
and
slew
the
king
in
his
own
house
and
the
people
of
the
land
slew
all
them
that
had
conspired
against
king
amon
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
josiah
his
son
king
in
his
stead
now
the
rest
of
the
acts
of
amon
which
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
kings
of
judah
and
he
was
buried
in
his
sepulchre
in
the
garden
of
uzza
and
josiah
his
son
reigned
in
his
stead
josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
thirty
and
one
years
in
jerusalem
and
his
mother's
name
was
jedidah
the
daughter
of
adaiah
of
boscath
and
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
walked
in
all
the
way
of
david
his
father
and
turned
not
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
josiah
that
the
king
sent
shaphan
the
son
of
azaliah
the
son
of
meshullam
the
scribe
to
the
house
of
the
lord
saying
go
up
to
hilkiah
the
high
priest
that
he
may
sum
the
silver
which
is
brought
into
the
house
of
the
lord
which
the
keepers
of
the
door
have
gathered
of
the
people
and
let
them
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
the
doers
of
the
work
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
let
them
give
it
to
the
doers
of
the
work
which
is
in
the
house
of
the
lord
to
repair
the
breaches
of
the
house
unto
carpenters
and
builders
and
masons
and
to
buy
timber
and
hewn
stone
to
repair
the
house
howbeit
there
was
no
reckoning
made
with
them
of
the
money
that
was
delivered
into
their
hand
because
they
dealt
faithfully
and
hilkiah
the
high
priest
said
unto
shaphan
the
scribe
i
have
found
the
book
of
the
law
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
shaphan
and
he
read
it
and
shaphan
the
scribe
came
to
the
king
and
brought
the
king
word
again
and
said
thy
servants
have
gathered
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
and
have
delivered
it
into
the
hand
of
them
that
do
the
work
that
have
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
the
lord
and
shaphan
the
scribe
shewed
the
king
saying
hilkiah
the
priest
hath
delivered
me
a
book
and
shaphan
read
it
before
the
king
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
king
had
heard
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
law
that
he
rent
his
clothes
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
the
priest
and
ahikam
the
son
of
shaphan
and
achbor
the
son
of
michaiah
and
shaphan
the
scribe
and
asahiah
a
servant
of
the
king's
saying
go
ye
enquire
of
the
lord
for
me
and
for
the
people
and
for
all
judah
concerning
the
words
of
this
book
that
is
found
for
great
is
the
wrath
of
the
lord
that
is
kindled
against
us
because
our
fathers
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
this
book
to
do
according
unto
all
that
which
is
written
concerning
us
so
hilkiah
the
priest
and
ahikam
and
achbor
and
shaphan
and
asahiah
went
unto
huldah
the
prophetess
the
wife
of
shallum
the
son
of
tikvah
the
son
of
harhas
keeper
of
the
wardrobe
now
she
dwelt
in
jerusalem
in
the
college
and
they
communed
with
her
and
she
said
unto
them
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
tell
the
man
that
sent
you
to
me
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
bring
evil
upon
this
place
and
upon
the
inhabitants
thereof
even
all
the
words
of
the
book
which
the
king
of
judah
hath
read
because
they
have
forsaken
me
and
have
burned
incense
unto
other
gods
that
they
might
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands
therefore
my
wrath
shall
be
kindled
against
this
place
and
shall
not
be
quenched
but
to
the
king
of
judah
which
sent
you
to
enquire
of
the
lord
thus
shall
ye
say
to
him
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
israel
as
touching
the
words
which
thou
hast
heard
because
thine
heart
was
tender
and
thou
hast
humbled
thyself
before
the
lord
when
thou
heardest
what
i
spake
against
this
place
and
against
the
inhabitants
thereof
that
they
should
become
a
desolation
and
a
curse
and
hast
rent
thy
clothes
and
wept
before
me
i
also
have
heard
thee
saith
the
lord
behold
therefore
i
will
gather
thee
unto
thy
fathers
and
thou
shalt
be
gathered
into
thy
grave
in
peace
and
thine
eyes
shall
not
see
all
the
evil
which
i
will
bring
upon
this
place
and
they
brought
the
king
word
again
and
the
king
sent
and
they
gathered
unto
him
all
the
elders
of
judah
and
of
jerusalem
and
the
king
went
up
into
the
house
of
the
lord
and
all
the
men
of
judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
with
him
and
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
both
small
and
great
and
he
read
in
their
ears
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
which
was
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
the
king
stood
by
a
pillar
and
made
a
covenant
before
the
lord
to
walk
after
the
lord
and
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
testimonies
and
his
statutes
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul
to
perform
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
were
written
in
this
book
and
all
the
people
stood
to
the
covenant
and
the
king
commanded
hilkiah
the
high
priest
and
the
priests
of
the
second
order
and
the
keepers
of
the
door
to
bring
forth
out
of
the
temple
of
the
lord
all
the
vessels
that
were
made
for
baal
and
for
the
grove
and
for
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
he
burned
them
without
jerusalem
in
the
fields
of
kidron
and
carried
the
ashes
of
them
unto
bethel
and
he
put
down
the
idolatrous
priests
whom
the
kings
of
judah
had
ordained
to
burn
incense
in
the
high
places
in
the
cities
of
judah
and
in
the
places
round
about
jerusalem
them
also
that
burned
incense
unto
baal
to
the
sun
and
to
the
moon
and
to
the
planets
and
to
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
he
brought
out
the
grove
from
the
house
of
the
lord
without
jerusalem
unto
the
brook
kidron
and
burned
it
at
the
brook
kidron
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder
and
cast
the
powder
thereof
upon
the
graves
of
the
children
of
the
people
and
he
brake
down
the
houses
of
the
sodomites
that
were
by
the
house
of
the
lord
where
the
women
wove
hangings
for
the
grove
and
he
brought
all
the
priests
out
of
the
cities
of
judah
and
defiled
the
high
places
where
the
priests
had
burned
incense
from
geba
to
beersheba
and
brake
down
the
high
places
of
the
gates
that
were
in
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
of
joshua
the
governor
of
the
city
which
were
on
a
man's
left
hand
at
the
gate
of
the
city
nevertheless
the
priests
of
the
high
places
came
not
up
to
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
jerusalem
but
they
did
eat
of
the
unleavened
bread
among
their
brethren
and
he
defiled
topheth
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
children
of
hinnom
that
no
man
might
make
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
molech
and
he
took
away
the
horses
that
the
kings
of
judah
had
given
to
the
sun
at
the
entering
in
of
the
house
of
the
lord
by
the
chamber
of
nathanmelech
the
chamberlain
which
was
in
the
suburbs
and
burned
the
chariots
of
the
sun
with
fire
and
the
altars
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
upper
chamber
of
ahaz
which
the
kings
of
judah
had
made
and
the
altars
which
manasseh
had
made
in
the
two
courts
of
the
house
of
the
lord
did
the
king
beat
down
and
brake
them
down
from
thence
and
cast
the
dust
of
them
into
the
brook
kidron
and
the
high
places
that
were
before
jerusalem
which
were
on
the
right
hand
of
the
mount
of
corruption
which
solomon
the
king
of
israel
had
builded
for
ashtoreth
the
abomination
of
the
zidonians
and
for
chemosh
the
abomination
of
the
moabites
and
for
milcom
the
abomination
of
the
children
of
ammon
did
the
king
defile
and
he
brake
in
pieces
the
images
and
cut
down
the
groves
and
filled
their
places
with
the
bones
of
men
moreover
the
altar
that
was
at
bethel
and
the
high
place
which
jeroboam
the
son
of
nebat
who
made
israel
to
sin
had
made
both
that
altar
and
the
high
place
he
brake
down
and
burned
the
high
place
and
stamped
it
small
to
powder
and
burned
the
grove
and
as
josiah
turned
himself
he
spied
the
sepulchres
that
were
there
in
the
mount
and
sent
and
took
the
bones
out
of
the
sepulchres
and
burned
them
upon
the
altar
and
polluted
it
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
which
the
man
of
god
proclaimed
who
proclaimed
these
words
then
he
said
what
title
is
that
that
i
see
and
the
men
of
the
city
told
him
it
is
the
sepulchre
of
the
man
of
god
which
came
from
judah
and
proclaimed
these
things
that
thou
hast
done
against
the
altar
of
bethel
and
he
said
let
him
alone
let
no
man
move
his
bones
so
they
let
his
bones
alone
with
the
bones
of
the
prophet
that
came
out
of
samaria
and
all
the
houses
also
of
the
high
places
that
were
in
the
cities
of
samaria
which
the
kings
of
israel
had
made
to
provoke
the
lord
to
anger
josiah
took
away
and
did
to
them
according
to
all
the
acts
that
he
had
done
in
bethel
and
he
slew
all
the
priests
of
the
high
places
that
were
there
upon
the
altars
and
burned
men's
bones
upon
them
and
returned
to
jerusalem
and
the
king
commanded
all
the
people
saying
keep
the
passover
unto
the
lord
your
god
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
this
covenant
surely
there
was
not
holden
such
a
passover
from
the
days
of
the
judges
that
judged
israel
nor
in
all
the
days
of
the
kings
of
israel
nor
of
the
kings
of
judah
but
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
josiah
wherein
this
passover
was
holden
to
the
lord
in
jerusalem
moreover
the
workers
with
familiar
spirits
and
the
wizards
and
the
images
and
the
idols
and
all
the
abominations
that
were
spied
in
the
land
of
judah
and
in
jerusalem
did
josiah
put
away
that
he
might
perform
the
words
of
the
law
which
were
written
in
the
book
that
hilkiah
the
priest
found
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
like
unto
him
was
there
no
king
before
him
that
turned
to
the
lord
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
might
according
to
all
the
law
of
moses
neither
after
him
arose
there
any
like
him
notwithstanding
the
lord
turned
not
from
the
fierceness
of
his
great
wrath
wherewith
his
anger
was
kindled
against
judah
because
of
all
the
provocations
that
manasseh
had
provoked
him
withal
and
the
lord
said
i
will
remove
judah
also
out
of
my
sight
as
i
have
removed
israel
and
will
cast
off
this
city
jerusalem

i
have
chosen
and
the
house
of
which
i
said

and
pharaohnechoh
put
him
in

not
reign

these
were

now
the
philistines
fought
against
israel
and
the
men
of
israel
fled
from
before
the
philistines
and
fell
down
slain
in
mount
gilboa
and
the
philistines
followed
hard
after
saul
and
after
his
sons
and
the
philistines
slew
jonathan
and
abinadab
and
malchishua
the
sons
of
saul
and
the
battle
went
sore
against
saul
and
the
archers
hit
him
and
he
was
wounded
of
the
archers
then
said
saul
to
his
armourbearer
draw
thy
sword
and
thrust
me
through
therewith
lest
these
uncircumcised
come
and
abuse
me
but
his
armourbearer
would
not
for
he
was
sore
afraid
so
saul
took
a
sword
and
fell
upon
it
and
when
his
armourbearer
saw
that
saul
was
dead
he
fell
likewise
on
the
sword
and
died
so
saul
died
and
his
three
sons
and
all
his
house
died
together
and
when
all
the
men
of
israel
that
were
in
the
valley
saw
that
they
fled
and
that
saul
and
his
sons
were
dead
then
they
forsook
their
cities
and
fled
and
the
philistines
came
and
dwelt
in
them
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
when
the
philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain
that
they
found
saul
and
his
sons
fallen
in
mount
gilboa
and
when
they
had
stripped
him
they
took
his
head
and
his
armour
and
sent
into
the
land
of
the
philistines
round
about
to
carry
tidings
unto
their
idols
and
to
the
people
and
they
put
his
armour
in
the
house
of
their
gods
and
fastened
his
head
in
the
temple
of
dagon
and
when
all
jabeshgilead
heard
all
that
the
philistines
had
done
to
saul
they
arose
all
the
valiant
men
and
took
away
the
body
of
saul
and
the
bodies
of
his
sons
and
brought
them
to
jabesh
and
buried
their
bones
under
the
oak
in
jabesh
and
fasted
seven
days
so
saul
died
for
his
transgression
which
he
committed
against
the
lord
even
against
the
word
of
the
lord
which
he
kept
not
and
also
for
asking
counsel
of
one
that
had
a
familiar
spirit
to
enquire
of
it
and
enquired
not
of
the
lord
therefore
he
slew
him
and
turned
the
kingdom
unto
david
the
son
of
jesse
then
all
israel
gathered
themselves
to
david
unto
hebron
saying
behold
we
are
thy
bone
and
thy
flesh
and
moreover
in
time
past
even
when
saul
was
king
thou
wast
he
that
leddest
out
and
broughtest
in
israel
and
the
lord
thy
god
said
unto
thee
thou
shalt
feed
my
people
israel
and
thou
shalt
be
ruler
over
my
people
israel
therefore
came
all
the
elders
of
israel
to
the
king
to
hebron
and
david
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
hebron
before
the
lord
and
they
anointed
david
king
over
israel
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
by
samuel
and
david
and
all
israel
went
to
jerusalem
which
is
jebus
where
the
jebusites
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
the
inhabitants
of
jebus
said
to
david
thou
shalt
not
come
hither
nevertheless
david
took
the
castle
of
zion
which
is
the
city
of
david
and
david
said
whosoever
smiteth
the
jebusites
first
shall
be
chief
and
captain
so
joab
the
son
of
zeruiah
went
first
up
and
was
chief
and
david
dwelt
in
the
castle
therefore
they
called
it
the
city
of
david
and
he
built
the
city
round
about
even
from
millo
round
about
and
joab
repaired
the
rest
of
the
city
so
david
waxed
greater
and
greater
for
the
lord
of
hosts
was
with
him
these
also
are
the
chief
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
who
strengthened
themselves
with
him
in
his
kingdom
and
with
all
israel
to
make
him
king
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
concerning
israel
and
this
is
the
number
of
the
mighty
men
whom
david
had
jashobeam
an
hachmonite
the
chief
of
the
captains
he
lifted
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
slain
by
him
at
one
time
and
after
him
was
eleazar
the
son
of
dodo
the
ahohite
who
was
one
of
the
three
mighties
he
was
with
david
at
pasdammim
and
there
the
philistines
were
gathered
together
to
battle
where
was
a
parcel
of
ground
full
of
barley
and
the
people
fled
from
before
the
philistines
and
they
set
themselves
in
the
midst
of
that
parcel
and
delivered
it
and
slew
the
philistines
and
the
lord
saved
them
by
a
great
deliverance
now
three
of
the
thirty
captains
went
down
to
the
rock
to
david
into
the
cave
of
adullam
and
the
host
of
the
philistines
encamped
in
the
valley
of
rephaim
and
david
was
then
in
the
hold
and
the
philistines
garrison
was
then
at
bethlehem
and
david
longed
and
said
oh
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
is
at
the
gate
and
the
three
brake
through
the
host
of
the
philistines
and
drew
water
out
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
that
was
by
the
gate
and
took
it
and
brought
it
to
david
but
david
would
not
drink
of
it
but
poured
it
out
to
the
lord
and
said
my
god
forbid
it
me
that
i
should
do
this
thing
shall
i
drink
the
blood
of
these
men
that
have
put
their
lives
in
jeopardy
for
with
the
jeopardy
of
their
lives
they
brought
it
therefore
he
would
not
drink
it
these
things
did
these
three
mightiest
and
abishai
the
brother
of
joab
he
was
chief
of
the
three
for
lifting
up
his
spear
against
three
hundred
he
slew
them
and
had
a
name
among
the
three
of
the
three
he
was
more
honourable
than
the
two
for
he
was
their
captain
howbeit
he
attained
not
to
the
first
three
benaiah
the

of

he
slew

lionlike
men
of

also
he
went
down
and
slew
a
lion
in
a
pit
in
a
snowy
day
and
he
slew
an
egyptian
a
man
of
great
stature
five
cubits
high
and
in
the
egyptian's
hand
was
a
spear
like
a
weaver's
beam
and
he
went
down
to
him
with
a
staff
and
plucked
the
spear
out
of
the
egyptian's
hand
and
slew
him
with
his
own
spear
these
things
did
benaiah
the
son
of
jehoiada
and
had
the
name
among
the
three
mighties
behold

was
honourable

separated
themselves
unto

wilderness
men
of

men
of
war
fit
for

could

these
are

that
went
over

in

month
when

had
overflown
all
his
banks
and
they
put
to
flight
all
them
of
the
valleys
both
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
and
there
came
of
the
children
of
benjamin
and
judah
to
the
hold
unto
david
and
david
went
out
to
meet
them
and
answered
and
said
unto
them
if
ye
be
come
peaceably
unto
me
to
help
me
mine
heart
shall
be
knit
unto
you
but
if
ye
be
come
to
betray
me
to
mine
enemies
seeing
there
is
no
wrong
in
mine
hands
the
god
of
our
fathers
look
thereon
and
rebuke
it
then
the
spirit
came
upon
amasai
who
was
chief
of
the
captains
and
he
said
thine
are
we
david
and
on
thy
side
thou
son
of
jesse
peace
peace
be
unto
thee
and
peace
be
to
thine
helpers
for
thy
god
helpeth
thee
then
david
received
them
and
made
them
captains
of
the
band
and
there
fell
some
of
manasseh
to
david
when
he
came
with
the
philistines
against
saul
to
battle
but
they
helped
them
not
for
the
lords
of
the
philistines
upon
advisement
sent
him
away
saying
he
will
fall
to
his
master
saul
to
the
jeopardy
of
our
heads
